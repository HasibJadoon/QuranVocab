T H E Q U R  A N
T he Q ur  an is the supreme authority in Islam. It is the fundamental and
paramount source of the creed, rituals, ethics, and laws of the Islamic religion.
This supreme status stems from the belief that the Qur  an is the word of God,
revealed to the Prophet Muhammad via the archangel Gabriel, and intended
for all times and all places.
The Qur  an was the starting point for all the Islamic sciences, which were
developed in order to study its grammar, pronunciation, and style, and it is the
basis of Islamic law and theology; indeed, as the celebrated fi fteenth-century
scholar and author Suyuti said, ‘Everything is based on the Qur  an’. The
entire religious life of the Muslim world is built around the text of the Qur  an.
As a consequence of the Qur  an, the Arabic language moved far beyond
the Arabian peninsula, deeply penetrating many other languages within the
Muslim lands––Persian, Turkish, Urdu, Indonesian, and others. The fi rst sura
(or section) of the Qur  an, al-Fatiha , which is an essential part of the ritual
prayers, is learned and read in Arabic by Muslims in all parts of the world, and
many other verses and phrases in Arabic are also incorporated into the lives of
non-Arabic-speaking Muslims.
M. A. S. A bdel H aleem was born in Egypt, and learned the Qur  an by heart
from childhood. Educated at al-Azhar, Cairo, and Cambridge Universities,
he has taught Arabic at Cambridge and London Universities since 1966 ,
including courses in advanced practical translation and the Qur  an. He is now
Professor of Islamic Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies,
University of London. His most recent publications are Understanding
the Qur  an: Themes and Style ( 2001 ) and English Translations of the Qur  an:
The Making of an Image ( 2004 ). He is also working on An Arabic–English
Dictionary of Qur  anic Usage , with El-Said Badawi. He is the editor of the
Journal of Qur  anic Studies and the London Qur  anic Studies series.

I N T RO D U C T I O N
T he Q ur  an is the supreme authority in Islam. It is the funda-
mental and paramount source of the creed, rituals, ethics, and laws
of the Islamic religion. It is the book that ‘di ff erentiates’ between
right and wrong, so that nowadays, when the Muslim world is
dealing with such universal issues as globalization, the environ-
ment, combating terrorism and drugs, issues of medical ethics, and
feminism, evidence to support the various arguments is sought in
the Qur  an. This supreme status stems from the belief that the
Qur  an is the word of God, revealed to the Prophet Muhammad via
the archangel Gabriel, and intended for all times and all places.
The Qur  an was the starting point for all the Islamic sciences:
Arabic grammar was developed to serve the Qur  an, the study of
Arabic phonetics was pursued in order to determine the exact pro-
nunciation of Qur  anic words, the science of Arabic rhetoric was
developed in order to describe the features of the inimitable style of
the Qur  an, the art of Arabic calligraphy was cultivated through
writing down the Qur  an, the Qur  an is the basis of Islamic law and
theology; indeed, as the celebrated fi fteenth-century scholar
and author Suyuti said, ‘Everything is based on the Qur  an’. The
entire religious life of the Muslim world is built around the text of
the Qur  an. As a consequence of the Qur  an, the Arabic language
moved far beyond the Arabian peninsula, deeply penetrating many
other languages within the Muslim lands––Persian, Turkish, Urdu,
Indonesian, and others. The fi rst sura (or section) of the Qur  an,
al-Fatiha , which is an essential part of the ritual prayers, is learned
and read in Arabic by Muslims in all parts of the world, and many
other verses and phrases in Arabic are also incorporated into the
lives of non-Arabic-speaking Muslims.
Muslim children start to learn portions of the Qur  an by heart in
their normal schooling: the tradition of learning the entire Qur  an by
heart started during the lifetime of the Prophet and continues to the
present day. A person attaining this distinction becomes known as a
ha fi z , and this is still a prerequisite for admission to certain religious
schools in Muslim countries. Nowadays the Qur  an is recited a
number of times daily on the radio and television in the Muslim

world, and some Muslim countries devote a broadcasting channel
for long hours daily exclusively to the recitation and study of
the Qur  an. Muslims swear on the Qur  an for solemn oaths in the
lawcourts and in everyday life.
The Life of Muhammad and the Historical Background
Muhammad was born in Mecca in about the year 570 ce . The
religion of most people in Mecca and Arabia at the beginning of
Muhammad’s lifetime was polytheism. Christianity was found in
places, notably in Yemen, and among the Arab tribes in the north
under Byzantine rule; Judaism too was practised in Yemen, and in
and around Yathrib, later renamed Madina (Medina), but the vast
majority of the population of Arabia were polytheists. They believed
in a chief god Allah , but saw other deities as mediators between
them and him: the Qur  an mentions in particular the worship of
idols, angels, the sun, and the moon as ‘lesser’ gods. The Hajj
pilgrimage to the Ka  ba in Mecca, built, the Qur  an tells us, by
Abraham for the worship of the one God, was practised but that
too had become corrupted with polytheism. Mecca was thus an
important centre for religion, and for trade, with the caravans that
travelled via Mecca between Yemen in the south and Syria in the
north providing an important source of income. There was no cen-
tral government. The harsh desert conditions brought competition
for scarce resources, and enforced solidarity within each tribe, but
there was frequent fi ghting between tribes. Injustices were practised
against the weaker classes, particularly women, children, slaves, and
the poor.
Few hard facts are known about Muhammad’s childhood. It is
known that his father Abdullah died before he was born and his
mother Amina when he was 6 years old; that his grandfather Abdul
Muttalib then looked after him until, two years later, he too died. At
the age of 8 , Muhammad entered the guardianship of his uncle Abu
Talib, who took him on a trade journey to the north when he was
12 years old. In his twenties, Muhammad was employed as a trader
by a wealthy and well-respected widow fi fteen years his senior named
Khadija. Impressed by his honesty and good character, she proposed
marriage to him. They were married for over twenty- fi ve years until
Khadija’s death when Muhammad was some 49 years old. Khadija
