Before the\ndeath of the Prophet, if the believers did not understand the\nrevelation, they could ask the Prophet himself. Many prophetic\ntraditions relate how believers asked him about the meaning of a\nverse or a word, and how he explained its meaning to them. But after\nIslam had spread across a large area, and many new converts whose\nmother tongue was not Arabic began to recite the text and listen to its\nrecitation, problems of comprehension became a real issue. From an\nearly period, scholars collected difficult lexical items from the\nQur’anic text. No less an authority than °ibn “abbas (d. 68 A.H./687\nA.D.) is often credited with the first commentary on the text. His\nTafsir is quoted by many later commentators, and although the\ncollections that have been published under this title probably do not\ngo back to him, there can be no doubt that his explanations found\ntheir way into later commentaries through his students. Likewise, the\ntreatise on the Lughat ’al-Qur’Gn that has been transmitted under his\nname may not really be his, but there can be no doubt that he\ninitiated a concern about difficult lexical items in the text.\n\nIn the first centuries of Islam, philological and theological\nexegesis of the Qur’an still went hand in hand, but in later times\nphilology became a separate field. This led to the publication of\ntreatises with titles such as Gharib ’al-Qur’an, in which difficult\nwords with an obscure meaning were collected. Such treatises are\nreported from grammarians like °abi ‘ubayd, °ibn Durayd,\n°ibn Faris, °ibn °al-Sikkit and Tha‘lab, to mention only some of the\nbest known. Most of these treatises have not been preserved, but the\nfamous Kitab tafsir gharib ’al-Qur’an by “ibn Qutayba (d.\n276 A.H./889 A.D.) was edited by Sagr (Cairo: 1958; repr. Beirut\n1978)."}

The earliest commentaries on the Qur’an that have been\npreserved give us a fairly good picture of which items were regarded\nby the commentators as difficult. They explain difficult words in the\ntext by paraphrasing them with other words that were more likely to\nbe understood by their readers. Muqatil °ibn Sulayman (d. 150\nA.H./767 A.D.), for instance, paraphrases the word mubin whenever\nit occurs with bayyin ‘clear’, and when the phrase khdlidina fiha\noccurs in a verse, Muqatil always adds ’ay 16 yamiitiina ‘i.e., they do\nnot die’. These are not exegetical, but lexicographical, remarks,\ninstigated by the presumed lack of knowledge on the part of the\nbelievers. This procedure gives us a unique window onto the level of\ncomprehension by common believers in the first and second\ncenturies of Islam. One may assume that the overriding concern of\nthe early commentators was to make sure that the believers\nunderstood every single word of the Holy Text. Yet, they were also\ninterested in the meanings of the words as such, witness their interest\nin foreign loanwords in the vocabulary of the Qur’an. This became a\ncontroversial issue at a later period, but at this early stage was\napparently not regarded as something out of the ordinary. Thus, for\ninstance, Muqatil informs us that the word firdaws ‘paradise’ is a\nGreek word, and that the word °’istabraq ‘brocade’ comes from\nPersian. This is purely lexicographical information, which does not\nserve any exegetical purpose. The tradition of quoting from the\nQur’an to illustrate the basic meaning of words was continued by\nlater lexicographers, even though they concentrated more on\nshawahid from poetry. In the first dictionary of Arabic, the Kitab ’al-\n‘ayn that is attributed to °al-Khalil °ibn °ahmad (d. 175 A.H./791\nA.D.), for instance, the number of quotations from the Qur’an is\nsurprisingly low.\n\nYet, the importance of the language of the Qur’an as a source of\nlinguistic knowledge is obvious from the thousands of quotations in\ngrammatical treatises. Some of the earliest grammatical treatises\nwere direct commentaries on the text, for instance °al-Farra°’s (d.\n207 A.H./822 A.D.) Ma‘ani ’al-Qur’dn and °al-°akhfash’s (d. 215\nA.H./830 A.D.?) book with the same title. In these commentaries,"}

In Sibawayhi’s (d. 177 A.H./793\nA.D.?) Kitab the shift is complete: he quotes the Qur’an (more than\n440 times!), not in order to elucidate its meaning, but as evidence of\nthe structure of Arabic, of which the text of the revelation is the\nprime example.\n\nGrammarians were primarily interested in the value of the text of\nthe Qur’an as the most important source of correct Arabic. Their\nentire discipline was intended to be an ancillary to the religious\nsciences, but one sometimes gets the impression that they used this\nimportant function as an excuse for their passionate study of the\nArabic language itself. Later grammarians routinely introduce their\ntreatises by pointing out how important the study of grammar and\nlexicography is for the study of the Qur’an. The grammarian °al-\nZamakhshari (d. 538 A.H./1144 A.D.), for instance, states in the\nintroduction to his Mufassal that he felt compelled to write his\ngrammar because of the slander advanced by the Shuibiyya against\nthe Arabic language. He argues that God has chosen Arabic, rather\nthan any foreign language, for His last revelation, which\ndemonstrates its superiority. Therefore, knowledge of grammar is\nindispensable for all those who wish to understand this revelation\nand the Islamic sciences. Apparently, even when grammarians were\nmainly attracted by the subtleties of Arabic grammar, they still felt\nthe need to justify their interest by pointing out how important the\nstudy of grammar was for understanding the Qur’an.\n\nThe emphasis on the grammatical aspects of the language of the\nQur’an rather than the lexical aspects is obvious from the many\ntreatises on the declension of the Qur’an or the style of the Qur’an.\nBy contrast, no special dictionaries of the Qur’anic lexicon seem to\nhave existed in the Classical period. That is to say, there were\ncollections of difficult words, but no dictionaries that dealt with the\nentire lexicon, no monographs dealing exclusively with the lexicon\nof the Qur’an. One reason for this apparent lack may have been that\nthe lexicographers did not feel the need to compile such a dictionary\nbecause all words from the Qur’an could be found in any dictionary.\nIn the modern age this has changed, and special dictionaries are now"}

All Orientalist lexicographers,\nfrom Golius to Dozy, did include the lexicon of the Qur’an in their\ndictionaries, but they do not seem to have felt the urge to compile a\ndictionary of those words exclusively contained in the revelation. For\na long time, Fliigel’s concordance of the Qur’an (Leipzig, 1842)\nremained the only work in which all words were listed, albeit\nwithout a translation. The concordance was reprinted regularly (for\ninstance, in New Delhi 1992), until it was superseded by ‘abd °al-\nBaqi’s concordance, ’al-Mu‘jam ’al-mufahras li-’alfaz 701-01-7\n?al-karim (Cairo, 1958).\n\nIn Islamic languages other than Arabic, dictionaries were\ncompiled to facilitate the comprehension of the text of the Qur’an for\ncommon believers with little knowledge of Arabic. There is, for\ninstance, a dictionary compiled by Shaikh Abdulkarim Parekh\nentitled Complete Easy Dictionary of the Qur’an (Kuala Lumpur:\nNoordeen, 2003), in which each Arabic word has its meaning in\nEnglish given beneath, in the order of the text. This dictionary was\nalso translated into Bengali, Urdu, and Turkish. Other dictionaries of\nthis category include Abdul Mannan Omar’s Dictionary of the Holy\nQur’an (Rheinfelden: Noor Foundation International, 3rd ed., 2005),\nthough dictionaries of this kind were never meant to be scholarly\nresearch tools.\n\nThe first Arabic/English Qur’anic dictionary, and for a long time\nthe only one, was John Penrice’s, Dictionary and Glossary of the\nKoran, which was published in 1873, and has been reprinted ever\nsince. Nothing much is known about the author, except that he came\nfrom East Anglia, and that he was Patron of the Living in Little\nPlumstead in the Diocese of Norwich, as Serjeant mentions in the\nintroduction to the reprint of 1971 (New York: Praeger). No other\npublications are listed under Penrice’s name.

Because of the\ndifficulties the beginner in Arabic experiences in understanding the\ntext, he decided to write a dictionary with the Arabic motto Silk ’al-\nbayan fi mandaqib ’al-Qur’Gn, which he himself translates as ‘a clue\nof elucidation to the intricate passages of the Kor-an’.\n\nPenrice’s dictionary, which contains all words occurring in the\ntext of the Qur’an, has been reprinted numerous times, the most\nrecent reprint being that of 2004 (Mineola, NY: Dover Publications).\nApart from the fact that it has become outdated, it has also become\ndifficult to consult, because it uses Fliigel’s edition of the Qur’an and\nhis numbering of the verses, which differs from that of the standard\nCairo edition. In 2006, Duraid Fatouhi published a re-edition of the\nPenrice Dictionary (Kuala Lumpur: IBT Publications, 2006), in\nwhich he replaced the old numbering of the verses with that of the\nCairo edition, and substituted more recent translations, such as that\nby Yusuf Ali, for those used by Penrice. The most recent\nArabic/English Qur’anic dictionary is A Concise Dictionary of\nKoranic Arabic by Ame Ambros and Stephan Prochazka, which was\npublished in 2004 (Wiesbaden: L. Reichert). As the title indicates,\nthis is a concise dictionary, which does not give a detailed analysis of\nthe lexicon.\n\nThere was, therefore, a tremendous need for a new scholarly\ndictionary of the vocabulary of the Qur’an, with complete translation\nof all words, in which the abundant information in the commentary\nliterature would be taken into account. Such a dictionary has now\nbeen compiled by two eminent scholars, Prof. Elsaid Badawi and\nProf. Muhammad Abdel Haleem. The information in this dictionary\nis presented by root, as in most dictionaries, but an interesting feature\nis that at the beginning of each lemma the entire semantic range of\nthe root is given, together with a frequency count of each form\nbelonging to the root. This enables the reader to survey at one glance\nthe semantic domain of the root. For each individual lexical unit, the\nmeanings in different contexts are carefully distinguished.

This\ntrend continued after the death of the Prophet: we are told that the\nsecond Caliph, ‘umar °ibn °al-Khattab, whilst standing on the pulpit,\ninterrupted his recitation of (16:47) ‏تخوف‎ (le sasal (ya°’khudhuhum\n‘ala takhawwufin) to ask his audience of the meaning of eye\n(takhawwuf), whereupon a man from the tribe of Hudhayl is reported\nto have said, ‘This is from our dialect and it means “take them to\ntask, little by little’”’, and in support cited a line of poetry in which\nthe word was used in that sense, (°al-’itqan, v.

Surprisingly, however, interest in\nQur’ anic idiom as an independent discipline remained comparatively\nmodest. Furthermore, such somewhat limited interest as did exist\ncentred around specific groups of Qur’anic words: the ‏غريب القرآن‎\n(gharib ’al-Qur’dn), a term which refers to words considered to be\nless commonly known; ‏لغات القرآن‎ (lughat ’al-Qur’dGn), i.e. those\nwords which were thought of as belonging to dialects of certain\ntribes; ‏مجاز القرآن‎ (majaz ’al-Qur’dn) or ‏تشبيهات القرآن‎ 1\n?al-Qur’an), those Qur’anic words which were used in the\nmetaphorical sense; while studies dealing with ‏الوجوه والنظائر‎\n(’al-wujith wa’l-naz@’ir) discussed those words which were used to\nconvey different nuances in various contexts, termed ‏وجوه‎ (wujith), as\ncontrasted with ‏نظائر‎ (naza@’ir), i.e. words considered to be used in the\nsame way throughout the text. In addition to this large and expansive\nvestige of literature dealing with certain aspects of Qur’anic idiom,\nthere were works concerned with what became to be known as Luly!\n‏الإسلامية‎ (al-’alfaz °al-°’islamiyya) i.e. vocabulary which came to\nacquire a new Islamic nuance through its usage in the Qur’an and\nHadith. The first recorded extant example of this genre was °abi\nHatim °ahmad °ibn Hamdan °al-Razi’s (d. 322 A.H./932 A.D.)\npioneering work ‏فى الألفاظ الإسلامية‎ 443) (al-zinatu fi’l-’alfaz\n?al-’islamiyya).\n\nIt was °al-Raghib °al-°asfahani (d. 503 A.H./1108 A.D.) who\nproduced the most important major work, and perhaps the first of its\nkind, devoted to the Qur’anic vocabulary in its entirety, as opposed\nto those works devoted to specific groups of lexical items.

Indeed, °al-Raghib was of the opinion, expressed in the\nintroduction to his book, that of all the disciplines needed for the\nstudy of the Qur’an those concerned with the language itself should\ncome first, and, of these, those concerned with the meanings of the\nQur’anic vocabulary should be considered of primary importance.\n°al-Raghib’s implicit call for more attention to the study of the\nQur’an’s vocabulary might have been instrumental in the appearance\nover the years of works similar to his, such as ‏عمدة الحفاظ فى تفسير أشرف‎\n‏الألفاظ‎ (‘umdat ’al-huffaz fi tafsir °ashraf ’al-°alfaz) by *ahmad *ibn\nYusuf, generally known as °al-Halabi (d. 756 A.H./1355 A.D.).\nHowever, these remained comparatively few, paradoxically, perhaps\nbecause of the great value of °al-Raghib’s own work on the subject.\nSome of the particularities of Qur’anic usage became largely\nintegrated in general lexicographical works such as ‏سان العرب‎ 7\n°al-“arab). The appearance, between 1953 and 1970, of ‏معجم ألفاظ القرآن‎\n‏الكريم‎ (mu Fam ‏ج016”‎ ’al-Qur’an ’al-karim) published by the Arabic\nLanguage Academy of Egypt, followed by its revised edition in\n1989, did little for the advancement of the subject.\n\nIn the West, Qur’anic lexicography seems to have been almost\nignored. Although translation of the Qur’an into various European\nlanguages goes as far back as 1143, with the completion of a Latin\ntranslation by Robert Ketenensis of Chester, and in spite of the great\ninterest shown by the various churches in studying the history and\ntext of the Qur’an as the great book of Islam, it was not until the year\n1873 that the first work devoted to the vocabulary of the Qur’an by a\nWestern scholar, to our knowledge, appeared under the title gh) ‏سلك‎\n‏في مناقب القرآن‎ - A Dictionary and Glossary of the Kor-an.

However, the lack of, in particular, contextualised examples\nillustrating the range of sub-meanings of the various entries provided\nin Penrice’s work and its comparatively limited scope, together with\nthe fact that subsequent work on the subject—valuable as it was—was\nrestricted to specific groups of Qur’anic vocabulary (as in the case\nof, for example, Mustansir Mir’s 1989 Verbal Idiom of the Qur’an),\nonly illustrates the lacuna in the library of Qur’anic Studies. This\ndemonstrates the need for a comprehensive, fully researched and\nfully contextualised Arabic-English dictionary of Qur’anic usage\ncompiled in accordance with modern lexicographical methods and\nbased completely upon both the Classical Arabic idiom (derived\nfrom works such as Sibawayhi’s Kitab, °ibn-Ya‘ish’s Mufassal,\nLisdn ’al-‘arab and Lane’s dictionaries) and the work of\nauthoritative commentators on the Qur’an (such as Muqatil, °al-\nTabari, °al-Qurtubi, °al-Razi and many others). True, Qur’anic\nscholars continue to find assistance in Lane’s magnificent work An\nArabic-English Lexicon, particularly since the author includes\npertinent Qur’anic usages in numerous places in his work. However,\nthe appearance in 1960 of Hans Wehr’s A Dictionary of Modern\nWritten Arabic and the role it has played in elevating the study of\nModem Standard Arabic outside the Arab world has only\naccentuated the need for a parallel dictionary devoted specifically to\nthe language of the Qur’an.\n\nThe present Dictionary of Qur’anic Usage attempts to fill this\ngap. The work is based upon the interpretations by classical Qur’ anic\ncommentators of the contextualized occurrences of the finite\nvocabulary items used in the Qur’anic text according to the\nwidespread reading of Hafs ‏(قراءة حفص)‎ (d. between 180-90\nA.H./796-805 A.D.) through “asim ‏عاصم)‎ ye) (d. 127 A.H./744 A.D.)\nas rendered in the Egyptian printed text of the Qur’an.

The role of structural analysis in\ninterpreting literary texts in general, and the Qur’anic text in\nparticular, cannot be overestimated.

This kind of thing occurs much more\nfrequently in Qur’anic Arabic, and there is often something to be\nsaid for each of several possibilities’ (Companion to the Qur’an, pp.\n10-11). This particular feature of the language of the Qur’an often\nmakes interpreting the text an unending journey of discovery, and\nsupports a multitude of interpretations which, in turn, necessitates a\nhigh degree of familiarity with the various nuances of a particular\nword and the contexts in which they occur. Modern interpretations of\nthe Qur’an, such as, for example, the present drive to reinterpret the\nQur’an on the basis of modern scientific discoveries, particularly\nspace travel, is a case in point. Although legitimate and indeed\nnecessary, such interpretations remain outside the scope of this work.\n\nFor the purpose of the present work, acceptable interpretations of a\nparticular Qur’anic verse are those founded on the authority of the\nparticular commentator/s in question, and the validity of the\nstructural analysis they apply to the text to justify their\ninterpretations within both the immediate and larger context in which\nit occurs. Of equal importance to the grammatical structure of the\ndiscourse for our purposes here, if not of even greater significance, is\nthe capacity of many derived forms such as verbal nouns and\nparticiples to play varied roles within the discourse, some of which\nare not always well defined, thus opening the way not only for varied\ninterpretations of the text, but for ambiguity of meaning as well. For\nexample, in addition to conveying the basic meaning of an action or\nhappening ‏,(الحدث)‎ the verbal noun ‏(المصدر)‎ often functions in many\ncontexts as a noun, noun of place, noun of time or, in many contexts,\nas admitting the possibility of its functioning as a number of these at\nthe same time. For example, whereas the word ‏قر آن‎ clearly functions\nas a noun in (9:111) oe pall ‏التّورَاةٍ والإنجيل‎ st ra ale ‏وعدا‎ a true\npromise given by Him in the Torah, the Gospel and in the Qur’an;"}

The difficulty exercised in interpreting the\nvarious contexts in which plu. occurs stems mainly from the fact that\nmeasures of ‘nominality’ and ‘participiality’, of which this particular\nword could be formed, vary so much from one context to the other,\nthat it makes it difficult, in these contexts, to assign it to a nominal or\na participial function. While nominality is sufficiently evident in\n(22:78) ‏وقِي هذا‎ ar ce ‏الْمُلِمِينَ‎ Stic ‏هو‎ He called you Muslims—both in\nthe past and in this [message]; and participiality is equally evident in\n(3:84) (sales 4) GAS, and we are submitting to Him; it is not possible\nto decide one way or the other in a great number of contexts, such as\n(15:2) ‏صَشظِمِينَ‎ | sis ‏كفروا آنا‎ cull ‏ريما يود‎ those who disbelieve may come\nto wish they had submitted to God (or, to have been Muslim).

Roots are\nnaturally arranged in accordance with the alphabetical order of their\nconstituents. However, a note here should be made regarding the\nclassification of roots with geminated second and third radicals.\nUnlike the tradition followed in Western lexicography, e.g. Lane and\nWehr, such roots are classified in accordance with the order they\nshould have in consideration for the second and third radicals.\nConsequently the root s—b—b appears after the root s—b—’ and not\nbefore it. Words of foreign origin remaining as individual vocabulary\nitems, e.g. ‏,استبرق‎ are listed according to their alphabetical order and\nso are grammatical words belonging to no apparent Arabic roots,\nsuch as ‏.الذي‎ Arabicised words classified by Arab philologists under\nArabic roots and sharing the semantic field of the root with other\nderivatives, e.g. walS, are included under those roots. Foreign proper\nnames, e.g. ‏ب‎ oJ, ‏إسماعيل‎ and Cau, are classified in accordance with\ntheir Arabicised forms but, in instances such as ‏,آزر‎ where it could be\nthought that the name is derived from _/3/\\, cross references are\nprovided. Contrary to current conventions, transliterated hamza and\n‘ayn are accorded full alphabetical letter status. Consequently,\nvowels preceded by initial hamza or initial ‘ayn are never\ncapitalized, even if the words in which they occur happen to be\nproper names or begin new sentences, cf. °ahmad, but not ’Ahmad\nand ‘ad, but not ‘Ad. Cross references are also provided for words\nsuch as ‏,أسماء‎ whose true root may cause some difficulty. Because\nthe demarcation line between derivatives of roots, the third radicals\nof which are either ‏و‎ or ‏رى‎ are not always clear, many such roots are\ntreated together with the third radical marked as both ‏و‎ and ‏ى‎ (6-4\nwy).\n\nEach root is treated in the following way:\n1 - An inventory of the basic concepts covered by the root is"}

The dictionary senses detailed in this section are\nderived from the classical language, which may or may not include\nall the Qur’anic senses and could be used, when compared with the\nentries in the third section, to show the senses brought into the\nArabic language by the Qur’an. It is generally noted that what can be\ncalled semantic kinship between derivatives of Arabic, and also\nSemitic, roots is culture-bound and not always evident. Also, it is a\ncommonly acknowledged feature of Arabic that abstract derivatives\nusually stem from concrete ones (e.g. ‏جمال‎ ‘beauty’ from ‏جمل‎\n‎‘camel’; ‏ملاحة‎ ‘attractiveness’ from ‏ملح‎ ‘salt’ and ‏قرأ‎ ‘to read’ from ‏قرء‎\n‎‘a single milking of an animal’). Bringing together semantic\nderivatives of a root arranged, when relevant, in a sequence starting\nfrom the concrete and ending with the abstract, is likely to shed light\non the way in which these concepts are related to one another and\nalso on the manner in which each and all of those derivatives cover\nthe total semantic field of that root. Examination of this total picture\nis also likely to provide further means of appreciating the use of\nderivatives of that root in the Qur’an.\n\n2 - An inventory of the particular morphological derivatives of\nthat root actually occurring in the Qur’an, together with the number\nof times they occur. A comparison of the frequency of occurrence of\nthe various derivatives of a certain root and also of the total number\nof occurrences of all derivatives of this root with that of other roots\nshould be an indication of the relative importance the Qur’an\nascribes to concepts covered by the various roots. Figures provided\nfor the frequency of content derivatives are based upon the\nConcordance of Muhammad Fu’ad “abd °al-Baqi, ‏المعجم المفهرس لألفاظ‎\n‏القرآن الكريم‎ ?al-mu am ?al-mufahras li ‏ج61/6”‎ 701-01117571 ’al-Karim),\nwhereas those of the grammatical words not included in the\nConcordance of “abd °al-Baqi are based upon the Concordance of\n21520211 “amayirah and ‘abd °al-Hamid Mustafa ‏معجم الأدوات والضمائر في‎\n‏القرآن الكريم‎ (Muam °’al-’adawat wa °’al-dam@’ir fi’l-Qur’an °al-\nkarim). With regard to those words and roots of potentially non-\nArabic origin, little attention, beyond what is provided by Arab\nphilologists, has here been given to the etymology of Qur’anic\nwords, largely because we agree with Versteegh (1993, p. 89) that,"}

Contemporary research in the subject, furthermore,\ntends not to give enough consideration to the fact that Arabic, Syriac,\nHebrew and Ethiopic all share a common origin, a fact that will\nundoubtedly often make it difficult to distinguish between cases of\nborrowing and cases of parallel development. Considerations of time\nhave prevented the authors from including the various Readings\n‏,(قراءات)‎ save for a few instances.\n\n3 - Dictionary entries for each of the derivatives listed in\naccordance with the order in which they occur in ‘abd °al-Baqi’s\nConcordance. Because the Dictionary is concerned with actual\nQur’anic usage, headwords are given in one of the morphological\nforms they actually occur in the Qur’an in both Arabic script and\ntransliteration. For example, verbal forms of which no perfect forms\noccur are given in the imperfect, but if there is no imperfect then\nthey are given in the imperative. Passive forms are as a rule included\nunder the active forms and only given separate entries if they\ncontribute nuances of meaning beyond that of the active forms. Dual\nand plural forms are likewise treated in relation to their singular\nforms. Feminine forms occurring in Arabic with a 187 marbiita are\nrendered in the transliterated forms with a final tanwin in order to\ncircumvent the convention for representing the ta° marbita as ‘ah’\nor dropping it altogether.\n\nRoman numerals mark divisions along morphological and/or\nsyntactic lines, e.g. noun and participle and/or transitive and\nintransitive, whereas Arabic numerals mark divisions along semantic\nlines and lower-case letters mark semantic sub-divisions. The various\nsub-meanings cited for each entry reflect the range of contextual\nmeanings as elucidated by the classical Qur’an commentators\nconsulted in the compilation of this dictionary. Because of the\ndifficulty inherent in trying to define the often very subtly different\nmeanings of vocabulary items as they occur in various contexts,\nparticularly in a foreign language, the role of the illustrative\nexamples in approximating meaning remains paramount. This\ndifficulty is particularly evident, as it is in other languages, in the\ncase of prepositions. The line of demarcation between the various"}

In such instances, rather than\nignoring fine nuances of meaning and collapsing entries together\nunder one definition, items with a similar, but not identical, range of\nmeaning are kept separate and given definitions that reflect the\naffinity between them. Examples of such items can be found under\nthe entries for roots such as _/¥V3, Sell and \\/_/3. Alternative\ninterpretations of headwords occurring in the same verses are noted\nand, when sufficiently different, are classified under different sense\ndivisions.\n\nThe glosses for the illustrative examples are based upon M.A.S.\nAbdel Haleem’s translation The Qur’an—A New Translation by\nM.A.S. Abdel Haleem. However, because the purposes of the\ndictionary are not always identical with the purposes of a translation,\nchanges are made when necessary. In glossing illustrative verses,\nparticular attention has been given to trying (albeit not always\nsuccessfully) to parallel the structure of the original as much as\npossible, in some cases to the detriment of ‘style elegance’. Arabic\nforms and structures particularly difficult to render in matching\nstructures in English include transitive and intransitive verbs, passive\nand active verbs and nominal sentences whose predicates are\nnominal clauses. Particular difficulties are met in glossing the\nabsolute object ‏(المفعول المطلق)‎ which occurs quite frequently in the\nQur’an, because of the absence of parallel syntactic function in\nEnglish. The mode of glossing thus varies from one context to the\nother, as in the rendering of tal and Gh’ in (4: 164) gs all As ‏و‎\n‏كليم‎ but to Moses God spoke directly, and (4:65) peel alas ye\n‏تِسَلِيمًا‎ | galas ‏قضيّت و‎ Uae ‏حرجا‎ and then they will find no constraint in\ntheir hearts regarding your judgement, and yield completely; and\n(33:56) ‏وَسَلمُوا تَسَلِيمًا‎ ale | jhe bless him [the Prophet] and salute him\nwith greetings of peace (or alternatively, surrender yourselves\ncompletely to his guidance). Verses detailing future events in the past\ntense (usually to emphasise the inevitability of their occurrence), are\nas a rule rendered in the present tense in the English gloss, as in\n(39:73) ‏ة زْمرًا‎ al ‏وسييق الذين اتقوا ربهم | إلى‎ and those who are mindful of\ntheir Lord are conveyed to the Garden in groups.

Depending on the context, short distance may\nindicate contempt or intimacy, long distance may indicate respect\nor rejection, whereas middle distance may indicate a mixture of\nboth. Qur’anic commentators and literary scholars generally\nendeavour to discover the nuances of meaning hinted at by the\nmanipulation of the distance aspect of the various demonstratives.\nAn example may be found in the use of the long-distance\nindicator ust in (12:32) ‏فيه‎ itil gl usta ‏قالت‎ she said, ‘That [the\none you see there] is the one you blamed me for.’ Having heard\nthe ladies refer to Joseph with the near-distance ‏هذا‎ (12:31) I G\n8 this is not a mortal, and wishing to put an end to the rumours\ncirculating among some women in the town accusing her of\ntrying to seduce Joseph, the lady under whose roof he is living\nparades him before her guests and points to him with the remote\ndemonstrative ust thus hinting at his remoteness and their lack\nof intimacy although living physically close at hand. On the other\nhand, the use of the short-distance indicator ‏هذا‎ in (21:36) gl ‏أهذا‎\n‏َالهتَكمْ‎ 0 is this [here] the one who [mentions] runs down your\ngods? relates the contempt these people were expressing for the\nprophet and for his campaigning against their gods. The mixture\nof the opposing feelings of fear and trust felt by Moses when first\npresented with the two miracles of the serpent and the hand is\nindicated by the use of the mid-distance 43 in pointing out these\ntwo miracles to Moses (28:32) ails ‏فرعن‎ | hry te BERS ‏هَذَانِكَ‎\n‎these [two miracles here demonstrated] shall be two signs from\nyour Lord to Pharaoh and his chiefs. A revealing example of the\nway the various types of demonstratives are employed to convey\nnuances of meaning in the Qur’anic text may be found in two\nparallel verses (7:20) and (7:22). In pointing to the forbidden tree,\nthere physically close at hand, Satan uses ‏هذه‎ in his tempting of\nAdam and Eve (7:20) ‏أو‎ Gish 6S oy ‏الشجرة‎ ot He LST, USlgs ‏مَا‎\n‎Calla ( ‏تكو نا مِنَ‎ your Lord only forbade you this tree that you might\nbecome angels or of the immortals. But in reminding the couple\nof His original instruction to them to stay away from the tree,\nGod points to it with the long-distance indicator (7:22) ‏عن‎ tsi all\n3 ‏الشجرةٍ‎ tests did I not forbid you from that tree?

Reference\nis also made to his being bestowed with the ability to heal ‘the\nblind and the leper’ and to raise the dead (5:110). The Qur’an\nemphatically refutes the Christian doctrine of the Trinity at a\nnumber of junctures, referring to Jesus in the same vein as other\nvenerated Prophets of the Old Testament (5:75; 4:163). Indeed, it\nuses the account of the creation of Adam to highlight parallels\nbetween Adam’s and Jesus’ status and conception (3:55); in a\nnumber of instances Jesus is described as being supported by the\n‘Holy Spirit’ (2:87). Critically, the Qur’an refutes the notion of\nJesus’s crucifixion, stating that he ‘was not killed, nor was he\ncrucified, but so it appeared to them’ (4:155; 3:55)."}

The Qur’an\nrefers to the miraculous nature of his conception, describing his\nmother, Mary, as a chaste woman (5:75). Reference is also made\nto his being bestowed with the ability to heal ‘the blind and the\nleper’ and to raise the dead (5:110). The Qur’an emphatically\nrefutes the Christian doctrine of the Trinity at a number of\njunctures, referring to Jesus in the same vein as venerated\nProphets of the Old Testament (5:75; 4:163). Indeed, it uses the\naccount of the creation of Adam to highlight parallels regarding\nJesus’s status and conception (3:55); in a number of instances"}

As suggested by rhetoricians, comparisons between‏\n‎connected and unconnected sentences (which may otherwise be‏\n‎considered similar) can open the way to a better understanding of‏\n‎Qur’anic discourse as a whole (the reader is here referred to‏\n‎°al-Jurjani’s comparison between, e.g., verses (2:14) and (6:8)).‏\n‎Various usages of the particle wa, coupled with contextualised‏\n‎quotations from the Qur’anic texts, are each detailed in separate‏\n‎sections below. Grammatical designations for each usage are also‏\n‎given. However, the grammatical designations used for the‏\n‎various types of wa, should not be treated as definitive or‏\n‎absolute.

The focus when trying to appreciate a particular‏\n‎instance of the particle wa, therefore, should always be upon the‏\n‎illustrative Qur’anic verses themselves. With this proviso, the‏\n‎uses of the particle wa in the Qur’an may be broadly classified‏\n‎under a number of headings, the most notable of which are the‏\n‎following: I conjunctive wa (bell 55), best rendered in English‏\n‎as ‘and’, although often left untranslated; this is the most frequent‏\n‎usage of wa and the most versatile.

Rhetoricians place great aesthetic\nvalue on such differences and relate them to meaningful\ndifferences within larger contexts. Normally, the conjunctive wa\nis used to join constituents of the same grammatical category:\nnoun + noun, verb + verb, prepositional phrase + prepositional\nphrase, nominal sentence + nominal sentence, and the like.\nHowever, the Qur’anic text contains several occurrences of wa\njoining units of different categories such as the participle . ‏صافَات‎\n‎(saffat) 4 in state of] holding still [their oustspread wings] and the\nverb ( ‏يقبضنن‎ | (yagbidna) flapping [their wings] in verse (67:19) ald ‏و‎\n‏فوقهم 3 صافات و يَقبِضنَ‎ bl ol \"593 do they not see the birds above them\nholding still their outspread wings and [they fold] flapping\n[them]? The deviation from the norm in joining these two\nmorphologically different items, so rhetoricians point out, catches\nthe attention of the listeners/readers and directs them to the\ncontemplation of this aspect of the miracle of creation. Special\nsignificance is also attached to the use of wa as a conjunction\nlinking the verbal sentence ‏حَفَظَة‎ Sie duis 2 to the nominal sentence\n‏وهو القاهِر فق عبَادِهِ‎ in verse (6:61) Abie ‏وَيُرسيل عَلَيْكُمْ‎ valde ‏وَهُو الْقَاهِر فق‎\nHe is the Supreme Master over His subjects and He sends out\nrecorders/keepers to watch over you. The continuous sending of\nthe keepers (denoted by the use in the verse of the action-based\nverbal clause) can be guaranteed forever only if the sender is\nconstant and in absolute control. All of these nuances are\nconveyed by the use of the initial, verbless, nominal clause.
