The\nqualifier “historically oriented” is meant to signal that the book’s interest is in establishing,\nhowever hypothetically, what a given Qur’anic term would have meant to the Qur’an’s\nearliest recipients in early seventh- century western Arabia.\nThe book grew out of preliminary work t owards a commentary on Surahs 1–3 that was\nundertaken in the framework of the research proje ct Qur’anic Commentary: An Integrative\nParadigm (QuCIP), funded by the Eur o pean Research Council u nder the Eur o pean Union’s\nHorizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement no. 771047). As I dis-\ncovered much more swiftly than I would have liked, a commentary volume of the sort I had\nin mind needed to include or be supplemented by an examination of a considerable number\nof frequently recurrent and theologically pivotal Qur’anic words, such as → āyah (meaning a\nnatur al or historical “sign” of God), → kitāb (“scripture”), or → ittaqā (“to be wary,” namely,\nof God). A fter initially attempting to meet this objective through a glossary of key terms, a\nself- standing book eventually imposed itself as the more appropriate format. For unlike ordi-\nnary dictionaries, I do not simply offer a certain number of approximate En glish equivalents\nof a given Arabic word. Rather, the entries that follow provide a discursive and, as per the\nbook’s subtitle, “critical” account of how a par tic ul ar Qur’anic word or phrase semantically\nfunctions in vario us scriptural contexts, and attempt to extract impor tant aspects of Qur’anic\ntheology that are bound up with the terms in question. In pursuing this objective, I work\nthrough diverse bodies of philological data and argue for or against a great number of inter-\npretive claims, engaging with as much relevant prior scholarship as I have managed to track\ndown and pro cess. The dictionary’s entries therefore take the form of more or less concise\nscholarly essays on a certain word or group of words. This basic structure bears a certain\nresemblance to Mustansir Mir’s 1987 Dictionary of Qurʾānic Terms and Concepts, although I\nhave permitted myself to write at far greater length, reflecting the significant pro gress that\nthe study of the Qur’an has made over the past thirty-fi ve years.\nAs explained in more detail in the introduction, the dictionary’s basic approach is “con-\ncordantial,” which is to say that it aims to survey the way, or ways, in which a certain term or\nphrase is used across the entire Qur’anic corpus. This is essentially to practise what Muslim\nscholars have termed tafsīr al- qurʾān bi- l- qurʾān, “interpreting the Qur’an by means of the\nQur’an.” In addition, and in contrast to the dictionary by Mir just mentioned, most of my\nentries cultivate a close interest in the connections between Qur’anic language and other\ntextual corpora whose diction and content may be viewed as having had currency, in some\nshape or form, in the Qur’an’s historical milieu. Th ese corpora principally include the Bible,\nix", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

I hope that\nmy interest in identifying, where pos si ble, close extra- Qur’anic parallels and precursors for\nthe words and phrases I discuss will not come across as reductionist source- mongering,\nsince I am concerned with ascertaining difference as much as similarity.2\nAs just noted, this is not a dictionary of the usual kind, which for Qur’anic Arabic has\nbeen superbly compiled by Arne Ambros (CDKA; see also Badawi and Abdel Haleem\n2008). As a result, I have not felt obliged to produce an entry on every Qur’anic word,\nwhich would have turned this work into a multi-v olume series. My general policy has\nbeen to concentrate on words and phrases that I deemed to carry significant theologi-\ncal, anthropological, or cosmological weight and that occur at least several times across\ndiff er ent Qur’anic surahs, in many cases dozens or hundreds of times. For instance, the\nword → āyah, which designates sundry “signs” of God’s power and benevolence in nature\nand history but can also refer to textual units of the Qur’an, figures in more than 350 verses.\nAnother example, of obvious theological significance, is → allāh, “God,” with almost 2,700\noccurrences. Many other words that are extremely common are however omitted, such\nas the prepositions min and fī or the negator lā, all of which figure more than a thousand\ntimes. While my overarching preoccupation is with words that play a significant role in\narticulating the Qur’anic vision of God, h umans, and creation at large, I have in some cases\nincluded entries on expressions that give rise to more narrowly linguistic prob lems if t hese\nhave wider interpretive ramifications. Examples are → laʿalla (“so that,” “perhaps”) and\nthe demonstratives → dhālika and tilka (“that”). Even so, the pre sent volume is silent on\nlarge parts of Qur’anic vocabulary. Other words are treated only in passing, in entries with\nwhich they are cross- referenced. Thus, the verbs hawiya and ishtahā (“to desire”) are briefly\ndiscussed under other headings, such as → nafs, signifying the human “soul” or vital self,\nwhich the Qur’an pre sents as the wellspring of desires and appetites.\nDespite my two guiding considerations of theological significance and frequency, the\ndecision of which words and phrases to include has often been a subjective one. For in-\nstance, there is no entry on the verb “to say” (qāla). Admittedly, it has an abundance of\noccurrences, often precedes momentous statements attributed to the Qur’an’s opponents\nor historical protagonists, and also plays an impor tant literary role in the way the Qur’an\ndemarcates the voice of its divine speaker from that of its human con vey or, God’s “Mes-\nsenger,” as well as the way in which the Qur’an stages debates between the Messenger\nand his audience (Ashraf 2018; HCI 12–14). But it seems to me that all of these matters are\n1 On using reputedly pre-I slamic poetry in order to shed light on the Qur’an in a manner that minimises the\ndanger of relying on fabricated material, see Sinai 2019b, 19–26 (with further references). For reasons of space,\nthe pre sent work will usually reference relevant poetic verses that are potentially pre- Islamic without seeking\nto come to a considered verdict on their authenticity.\n2 For instance, with regard to Qur’anic verses affirming that God “sets a seal upon” the hearts of unbelievers\nI conclude that no meaningful antecedent has so far been identified in which the meta phor of heart- sealing is\nemployed in the same sense as in the Qur’an (→ khatama). Another Qur’anic phrase that is hitherto unprec e-\ndented is the category of the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb), an umbrella term for Jews and Christians.\nTwo further likely cases of Qur’anic conceptual innovation— and not, as some previous scholarship would have\nit (e.g., NB 23–25), of misunderstanding— are the application of the term → furqān, “salvation, deliverance,” to\ndivine revelations and the Qur’anic reception of the rabbinic concept of God’s “dwelling” or presence in the world\n(Hebrew: shәkinah), which is reconfigured as a divinely conferred sense of inward composure and tranquillity,\ndenoted by Arabic → sakīnah. Of course, one does well to remember the chestnut that absence of evidence is not\nevidence of absence: it is not impossible that seemingly unparalleled Qur’anic concepts or phrases nonetheless\nemerged prior to the Qur’an and that the latter is simply the earliest extant text documenting them.\nx Preface", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Despite\nthe criterion of frequency, I do cover some infrequent words closely bound up with other\nterms that more obviously meet my two conditions for inclusion. For example, the plural\nadjective → ghulf (“wrapped in foreskins” or “uncircumcised”) appears only in Q 2:88 and\n4:155 but forms an impor tant tessera in the Qur’an’s discourse about the human heart,\nthus complementing my entry on → qalb, “heart.” It also provides an impor tant piece of\nevidence in favour of the broader claim that the Qur’anic concept of the heart, unlike that\nof the vital self or → nafs, shows a significant imprint of Biblical language.\nThe Qur’an furnishes the multiple strands of post- Qur’anic Islam with a distinctive\nand partially unifying lexicon (see already GMK 46), even though the component terms\nof this lexicon do of course undergo significant semantic development over time, in addi-\ntion to exhibiting impor tant synchronic differences between vario us authors, disciplines,\nand schools of thought. Some of the entries in this dictionary could, I imagine, usefully\nserve as the chronologically first stratum in a conceptual history of fundamental Islamic\nterms like islām (“self-s urrender” or “self- dedication,” namely, to God), shirk (the illicit\n“association” of other beings with God), nafs (designating the human “soul” or “vital self”),\nor jihād (“contending” on behalf of God). Nonetheless, this book has no ambition to un-\ndertake a longitudinal study of the rich and absorbing post- Qur’anic reception history of\nthe words discussed. This has not, however, prevented me from making limited use of\npremodern Islamic scholarship, such as a number of well-k nown Qur’anic commentaries,\nwhere this seemed helpful in elucidating the range of meanings that Qur’anic terms would\nhave conveyed to the Qur’an’s initial addressees. The way I relate to premodern scriptural\nscholarship, in other words, is to treat it like “secondary lit er a ture,” as Patricia Crone\nonce put it (QP xv). Indeed, against t hose tempted to dismiss traditional Islamic sources\nas largely irrelevant or even detrimental to the historical- critical study of the Qur’an, I\nwould emphatically insist that prac ti tion ers of the latter are well advised to engage, albeit\nselectively and critically, with the sophisticated heritage of Islamic scriptural learning (see\nalso Sinai 2017c, 104–105). This is vividly illustrated by Q 6:91, discussed in an excursus\nunder → ashraka below. In the now dominant Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim reading of the Qur’an, this\nverse anomalously implies that the Qur’an’s pagan opponents recognised and transmitted\nthe Bible. The puzzling anomaly disa ppears, however, if one gives preference to a textual\nvariant transmitted in Islamic sources that turns a string of second-p erson verbs into the\nthird person while leaving the text’s consonantal skeleton or rasm unchanged. Paying\nattention to the text- critical achievements of premodern Muslim scholarship thus helps\ndispel an ostensibly intractable interpretive prob lem.\nI am therefore quite keen to avoid giving the indefensible impression that serious phil-\nological work on the Qur’an did not exist before the nineteenth century. I have tried to\nthrow this point into occasional relief by acknowledging, at several junctures, views of\npremodern authors that remain pertinent for historical- critical research. A disadvantage of\nthis approach is that it leads me to pre sent only isolated snapshots from the Islamic tradi-\ntion that happen to agree with my own culturally contingent sense of what is interpretively\nplausible. I can understand why some might frown upon what could be perceived as a wilful\nsubjection of premodern scriptural scholarship to modern hermeneutical concerns. But\nthis is precisely what treating premodern Islamic exegesis as secondary lit er a ture rather\nthan as a primary object of study boils down to in practice; and while I would agree that the\nhermeneutical agenda of classical exegetes like al- Ṭabarī or al- Zamaksharī deserves careful\nPreface xi", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In fact, it is very likely that the premodern scholarly tradition would have had\nmuch more to offer than the pre sent book is able to convey, if only I had permitted myself\nto spend more time looking. The best excuse I can proffer for having fallen short is that\nthis work is already bursting at the seams.\nI am conscious that my concern to foreground the need for a judicious mea sure of criti-\ncal engagement with traditional Islamic scholarship is bound to be diluted by a concurrent\neffort, namely, my attempt to benefit from older Eu ro pean research that has tended to\nsuffer from undeserved neglect or mere token acknowledgement, especially German schol-\narship of the nineteenth and early twentieth c entury. Just like premodern Islamic works,\nsuch “Orientalist” publications can be punctuated by assertions that many con temporary\nscholars would be hesitant to repeat, such as a casual sense of Eur o pean cultural superiority\nor naively disparaging remarks about Muhammad and the Qur’an. But as with premod-\nern scholarship in Arabic, it is usually worth a con temporary researcher’s while to try to\nexcavate the genuine philological and interpretive insights under neath the occasionally\nuninviting surface. As one particularly imposing figure among early Western scholars of\nthe Qur’an, I would single out Josef Horovitz (d. 1931; see, e.g., Goitein 1935, Conrad 2002,\nJäger 2008, and Johnston-B loom 2018). His treatment of many of the Qur’anic terms also\ncovered in the pre sent book balances sensitivity to inner- Qur’anic usage with due attention\nto relevant Jewish and Christian pre ce dents and, crucially, early Arabic poetry. In many\nre spects, his ground- breaking work still forms a model of scholarly thoroughness and\nsound judgement, and the fact that Horovitz’s academic legacy was stymied, displaced, and\ndispersed in the wake of World War II and the Holocaust constituted a major setback for\nthe modern study of the Qur’an. Fittingly, Horovitz is also the ultimate stimulator b ehind\nthe concordance of pre- Islamic poetry that has served me as an impor tant resource (Arazi\nand Masalha 1999; see ibid., 7).\nAnother obvious and more recent source of inspiration is Toshihiko Izutsu (d. 1993; see\nAlbayrak 2012). Izutsu, on whom the introduction has more to say, pioneered the analy sis\nof Qur’anic “semantic fields” in light of pre-I slamic poetry. He also placed a generally wel-\ncome emphasis on the Qur’an’s reworking and reshaping of existing concepts. Arguably,\nIzutsu showed less interest than one might today wish in the fact that by the Qur’an’s\ntime Arabic had for centuries rubbed shoulders with vari ous forms of Aramaic and other\nancient languages (but see GMK 106–119). As noted at several junctures in the pre sent\nvolume, it is pos si ble or even likely that many of the Qur’an’s “ethico- religious concepts,”\nas Izutsu calls them, were coined by pre- Islamic Arabophone Christians and Jews and\nthen radiated outward into syncretistically minded pagan (i.e., not self- avowedly Jewish\nor Christian) circles. A prime illustration for this is the verb → șallā, whose Qur’anic\nmeaning “to pray” is sufficiently attested in early Arabic poetry in order to permit the\nconfident claim that the word was already employed by pre- Qur’anic Jews and Christians,\nundoubtedly under the influence of its Aramaic cognate. Hence, some of the semantic\ndifferences between the language of pre- Islamic poetry and that of the Qur’an— such\nas the fact that the Qur’an employs the verb → kafara for unbelief in or “repudiation”\nxii Preface", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In line with previous publications of mine (especially HCI 40–77), I am reasonably\noptimistic that the Qur’anic corpus is by and large explicable within the broad par ameters\nof the traditional Islamic narrative of origins, with some modifications and shorn of the\nprofuse anecdotal, and often unverifiable, detail supplied by post- Qur’anic Islamic sources\n(see in more detail the synthesis in Sinai, forthcoming a). This means that I am content\nto approach the Qur’anic corpus as having emerged in early seventh- century Mecca and\nMedina and during the life of a charismatic preacher called Muhammad, though I would\nnot a priori rule out the possibility that specific Qur’anic passages underwent a degree\nof early post- prophetic editing and expansion (see HCI 52–54 and under → bayyana as\nwell as the somewhat similar model in Tesei 2019). I recognise that certain features of\nthe Qur’an jar with the portrayal of its environment in the Islamic tradition and also with\nthe pre sent state of our archaeological and other historical knowledge. In par tic u lar, as\nGuillaume Dye and Tommaso Tesei have pointed out, the Qur’an’s extensive adaptation\nof Christian traditions and narratives sits somewhat uneasily with the lack of evidence for\norganised Christian communities in the immediate milieu in which the Qur’an’s genesis\nis supposed to have unfolded (Dye 2019, 772–776; Tesei 2021, 188–189). However, seeing\nthat in the early seventh century the Ḥijāz had effectively become encircled by Christian\ncentres in Najrān, in Ethiopia, in the northern borderlands of the Arabian Peninsula, and on\nthe Gulf coast (e.g., Munt 2015, 252–253), I am not sufficiently unsettled by the dissonance\njust noted in order to be tempted to jettison the conventional paradigm of the Qur’an’s\ngestation— for instance, by decoupling extensive sections of the Qur’anic corpus from the\ncareer of Muhammad and his Ḥijāzī context (thus Dye 2019, 784, and Tesei 2021, 189).4 I\nalso adhere to a fairly conventional, though not undisputed, understanding of the Qur’an’s\ninternal chronology, as a unilinear diachronic sequence leading from the Meccan surahs to\n3 Sometimes pre-I slamic poetry may nonetheless contain valuable vestiges of such Jewish and Christian\nusage. Apart from the case of șallā, “to pray,” see, e.g., the poetic formula bi- ḥamdi llāhi and variants, whose\nlikely link to Christian doxologies is briefly discussed in Sinai 2019b, 62.\n4 The fact that some fundamental religious terms in Qur’anic Arabic have their most immediate ancestors in\nClassical Ethiopic— including → al- injīl (meaning the Gospel or the Christian Bible), → al-ḥ awāriyyūn (denoting\nthe apostles of Christ; see under → rasūl), fāṭir (“creator”; → khalaqa), and prob ably also → al- shayṭān (“the\ndevil”) and → jahannam (“hell”)— certainly coheres very well with the supposition that the manifold Christian\ntraditions found in the Qur’an passed through western Arabia. To previous arguments in favour of a Ḥijāzī origin\nof the Qur’an, one may now add van Putten’s detailed contention that the Qur’an’s canonical rasm tends to display\nmorphological and phonological features that are associated with Ḥijāzī Arabic, such as the loss of the glottal\nstop or hamzah (van Putten 2022, 99–149). It must be conceded that our understanding of the idiosyncrasies\nof Ḥijāzī Arabic is often dependent on information supplied by Muslim scholars, who may at least on occasion\nhave derived their understanding of Ḥijāzī Arabic from the Qur’anic text, even if one would also expect state-\nments about dialectal features to have been to some degree controlled by common linguistic knowledge. But the\npossibility of circular inference does not apply to the elision of glottal stops, since in the post- Qur’anic Islamic\ntradition the Qur’an was usually recited with hamzahs (van Putten 2022, 150–181).\nPreface xiii", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In\ngeneral, I trust that when I speak of Muhammad as a historical actor, of Mecca and Medina\nas historically concrete sites of his activity, and of Meccan and Medinan surahs, then more\nsceptically inclined readers w ill know to make appropriate subtractions from my state-\nments in line with their own historiographical temperament. I would be equally pleased\nif something equivalent turned out to be pos si ble for those Muslim readers who feel that\nmy approach to the Islamic tradition is excessively, rather than insufficiently, sceptical.\nAs I have tried to signal, I am not dogmatically opposed to the hypothesis of a late clo-\nsure of the Qur’anic corpus; I merely think that the hypothesis has so far run an explanatory\nbudg et deficit (but see, again, the careful argument for limited mid-seventh-century addi-\ntions to the Qur’an in Tesei 2019). I am, however, convinced that the division of the Qur’an\ninto the three principal groups of surahs and passages to which I appeal— early Meccan,\nlater Meccan, and Medinan—is capable of being justified in terms immanent to the text\nitself, such as style, lexicon, and distinctive theological positions, and that such a subdivi-\nsion accordingly does not require much faith in the historical accuracy of the early Islamic\nhistorical rec ord. For instance, features permitting one to draw a fairly confident boundary\nbetween the Meccan and Medinan layers of the Qur’anic corpus include divergent con-\nceptions of divine punishment, a Medinan turn towards militant activism, and diff er ent\nunderstandings of Muhammad’s prophetic role (Marshall 1999, 117–185; Sinai 2015–2016;\nSinai 2018a; Durie 2018, 47–103; O’Connor 2022; Sinai 2022a). Hence, t hose who are\nwary of the geo graph i cal and historiographical implications that undeniably inhere in the\ntraditional classifiers “Meccan” and “Medinan” may well opt to speak of “pre- transitional”\nand “post- transitional” surahs, like Mark Durie, but should nonetheless find it pos si ble to\naccept that the scope of both textual groups is broadly similar to what is presupposed by\nme. Similarly, Tommaso Tesei has recently analysed a corpus of Qur’anic texts consisting in\na majority of the early Meccan surahs as defined by Theodor Nöldeke (Tesei 2021). While\nTesei sees promise in a non-s tandard account of the Qur’an’s origins and proposes to limit\nthe proclamations delivered by Muhammad himself to the cluster of surahs studied by him,\nhe agrees at least that this group of texts is stylistically and thematically coherent, and also\nthat it forms the earliest layer of the Qur’an. This inspires some hope that Nöldekian talk\nof early Meccan surahs will to a considerable degree turn out to be translatable into an\nanalytic idiom with diff er ent historical background assumptions. Given such alignment\nin the ways in which the Qur’anic corpus is partitioned into smaller textual groups, I am\nhopeful that the following attempts to ascertain the meaning of Qur’anic terms and thereby\nto track the contours of Qur’anic theology have value even for scholars who dispute some\nof my own historical and chronological views.\nI am grateful to the other members of the QuCIP proj ect based at Oxford University—\nMarianna Klar, Behnam Sadeghi, Nora K.

However, the fact that the entries\nare arranged according to the Arabic alphabet inevitably poses a significant hurdle for\nreaders whose command of the language is l imited or non- existent. In order to circumvent\nthis obstacle, I provide, at the end of the book, both an index of Qur’anic terms in En glish\ntranslation and an index of Arabic terms covered that is arranged according to the En glish\nalphabet. Thus, a reader who wishes to look up the verb ashraka (“to associate”) or the\nactive participle mushrik (“someone who associates”) but who is unsure of its position in\nthe main dictionary (namely, u nder the root sh- r- k) will be directed to the relevant page\nvia the index of Arabic terms arranged according to the En glish alphabet.\nAs for the En glish index, it reflects in the first instance the translations of Arabic words\nthat are adopted, and sometimes explic itly argued for, in the pre sent dictionary. But\nthe En glish index also includes some common En glish translations that I do not endorse\nmyself, such as “to disbelieve” or “to be an unbeliever” for the Arabic verb kafara or “unlet-\ntered” and “illiterate” for ummī. Given the very considerable overlap between most current\nEn glish renderings of the Qur’an, this should make it pos sib le to use the pre sent dictionary\nalongside diff er ent translations—at least for those Arabic terms that tend to be translated\nfairly consistently by the same En glish words. By way of an illustration, assume that you\nare reading the first verse of the first surah of the Qur’an, variously rendered “In the Name\nof Allah, the Merciful, the Compassionate” (Bell); “In the Name of God, the Merciful, the\nCompassionate” (Arberry, Droge); “In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful”\n(Study Qur an = SQ); “In the Name of the Merciful and Compassionate God” (Jones); or\n“In the name of God, the Lord of Mercy, the Giver of Mercy” (Abdel Haleem). The En glish\nentries “God,” “Allāh,” “merciful,” and “compassionate” all redirect to the corresponding\nArabic words (namely, allāh, raḥmān, and raḥīm), which can then be looked up in the main\ndictionary or in the index of Arabic words arranged according to the En glish alphabet.\nThis is not to rule out occasional gaps in coverage. For example, Abdel Haleem’s slightly\nidiosyncratic rendering of the Arabic words al- raḥmān and al- raḥīm as “Lord of Mercy”\nand “Giver of Mercy” is not reflected in my En glish index. There is, however, an entry for\n“mercy” (corresponding to the Arabic noun raḥmah), from which an interested reader w ill\nbe able to pick up the thread. Still, it must be acknowledged that Abdel Haleem’s policy of\nfrequently varying the manner in which one and the same Arabic expression is rendered\ninto En glish makes it difficult to produce an English- Arabic glossary for his translation\nthat is comprehensive yet remains within reasonable bounds.\nHeadings in the main dictionary are given in transliterated Arabic. In line with the\nstandard practice for Arabic, these headings are generally arranged according to the\nxvii", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For example, the verb ashraka, “to\nassociate” (namely, other beings with God), is found u nder the letter shīn, and the pas-\nsive participle muṭahhar is located under the letter ṭāʾ. Proper names like isrāʾīl, “Israel,”\nand al-ṭ āghūt, “false gods,” are incorporated into this system irrespective of their true\netymology. As may go without saying, the definite article is to be disregarded: al- naṣārā,\n“the Christians,” is found under the letter nūn. In hard cases, I have generally followed\nthe ordering of Ambros’s dictionary (CDKA). In par tic u lar, I adhere to his placement of\ngeminate roots such that, for instance, m- l- k is placed before m- l- l rather than vice versa.\nSome words that may be, or have been, assigned to more than one consonantal root or\nthat could give rise to confusion (e.g., madīnah, malak, or māʾ) are deliberately listed in\nseveral places, with appropriate cross- references.\nWhere the heading of an entry encompasses more than one Arabic word, verbs pre-\ncede nouns and adjectives. The same applies if there are several headings with the same\nconsonantal root, meaning that the entry on the verb ṣaddaqa (“to hold or declare s.th. to\nbe true, to confirm s.th.”) precedes that on the noun ṣadaqah (designating a charitable act\nor gift). Headings contain only a minimum of linguistic information, which is more fully\nsupplied in CDKA and Badawi and Abdel Haleem 2008. Thus, I do not offer plural forms\nfor words given in the singular, while verbs are cited only in the suffix conjugation (māḍī)\nwithout an accompanying prefix-conjugation (muḍāriʿ) form.1 I do however indicate, by\nmeans of the abbreviations “tr.” and “intr.,” w hether a verb is ordinarily used transitively\n(i.e., with a direct or accusative object) or not, and if the latter w hether the verb in question\ntakes a prepositional object (e.g., “ṣabara tr.,” “ṣabara intr.,” “kadhdhaba intr. bi-” ). Entries\non words that occur exclusively or predominantly in the plural have the plural form as\ntheir heading. Where the heading of an entry consists of more than one word, such as the\nphrase azwāj muṭahharah (“purified spouses”), cross- references employ the symbol ˻ in\norder to signal which of the component terms o ught to be looked up. For instance, since\nthe expression azwāj muṭahharah is discussed u nder muṭahhar, cross- references will take\nthe form “→ azwāj ˻muṭahharah.”\nIn quotations of multiple Qur’anic passages, the symbol ± followed by angle brack-\nets < > indicates that the textual segment in brackets may or may not be pre sent in the\nverses listed. In this way, the phrase khalaqa l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍa fī sittati ayyāmin (“he\ncreated the heavens and the earth in six days”; e.g., Q 7:54) and its variant khalaqnā l-\nsamāwāti wa-l -a rḍa wa- mā baynahumā fī sittati ayyāmin (“we created the heavens and\nthe earth and what is between them in six days”; Q 50:38) can be succinctly combined\ninto khalaqa/khalaqnā l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍa ± <wa- mā baynahumā> fī sittati ayyāmin. In\nQur’anic references, a string like “Q 27:18.28.50” refers to verses 18, 28, and 50 of Surah 27,\nwhereas “Q 27:18, 28, 50” would refer to verse 18 of Sura 27 in addition to Surahs 28 and\n50. I make liberal use of abbreviations for many frequently cited works (such as vario us\ndictionaries, Qur’anic commentaries, and some secondary lit er a ture). Th ese abbreviations\nare unscrambled in the bibliography at the end of the book.\nAs noted in the introduction, in some cases it was expedient to treat a number of non-\ncognate words in the same entry, thus allowing for a more coherent exploration of certain\ntopics. Examples are the verbs khalaqa, baraʾa, and faṭara, all of which refer to divine\n1 For the sake of simplicity, I also adhere to this practice where a certain verb is Qur’anically attested only\nin the muḍāriʿ (such as yaʿthā, cited as ʿathā).\nxviii How to Use This Book", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:23", "title": "Page 23", "locator": "pdf_page:23", "text": "INT RODUC T ION\nMany Qur’anic surahs are densely punctuated by terms and phrases that occur multiple\ntimes across the entire corpus. For a cursory illustration of the phenomenon, one needs\nto look no further than the beginning of the Qur’an’s opening surah, the Fātiḥah (Q 1).\nAs is well known, its opening invocation “In the name of God, the truly Merciful,” the\nso- called basmalah, prefaces all other surahs except for Surah 9. In addition, parts of the\nbasmalah, such as references to God’s “name” and the appellation “the Merciful,” appear\nin a host of other Qur’anic passages (including v. 3 of the Fātiḥah). Subsequent verses\nof Q 1, too, are sprinkled with diction that has a plethora of further attestations in the\nIslamic scripture: the doxology “Praise be to God” and the epithet “Lord of the world-\ndwellers” (→ rabb ˻al-ʿ ālamīn) in v. 2 (on the former, see, e.g., Q 6:1.45, 7:43, 10:10; on the\nlatter, see, e.g., Q 2:131, 5:28, 6:45.71.162); the expression “judgement day” in v. 4 (e.g.,\nQ 15:35, 26:82, 37:29); the concept of guidance (see under → hadā) and the meta phor of\nthe “straight road” (→ ˻al-ṣ irāt al- mustaqīm) in v. 6 (on the former, see, e.g., Q 2:2.5.16.26\netc. or 3:4.8.20 etc.; on the latter, see, e.g., Q 2:142.213, 3:51.101, 4:68.175); and the notions\nof divine wrath (see u nder → ghaḍiba ) and of g oing astray (see u nder → ḍalla) that appear\nin v. 7 (on God’s wrath, see, e.g., Q 2:61.90, 3:112, or 4:93; on going or leading astray, refer\nto, e.g., Q 2:16.26.108 etc. and 3:69.90.164).\nThe Qur’an is thus marked by a striking, perhaps even exceptional, degree of termino-\nlogical recurrence, a fact that is clearly linked to its highly formulaic character (on which\nsee Bannister 2014). Such terminological recurrence is in fact a boon for interpreters, since\nit is reasonable to assume that the dif er ent contexts in which a word or phrase occurs\nacross the Qur’an will often illuminate one another. This is so even if one takes due care to\navoid what James Barr has termed the m istake of “illegitimate totality transfer,” namely, the\nerror of reading into a par tic u lar occurrence of a given term in a specific literary context\nthe compound meaning that emerges from aggregating the totality of contexts in which\nthe term is used in the respective literary corpus as a whole (Barr 1961, 218). Thus, there is\nno doubt that the verb → jāhada, “to contend,” is in many Qur’anic passages used in the\nsense of militancy and fighting; but as discussed in the relevant entry below, it would be\nquite inappropriate to read this militant sense of jāhada, which is a feature of its employ-\nment in Medinan surahs, into an earlier Meccan occurrence like Q 25:52. Nevertheless, it\nis frequently the case that the occurrence of a given word or phrase in verse A shares rel-\nevant contextual or phraseological features with verses B, C, D, e tc. This includes cases in\nwhich verse B replaces the word in question by a dif ere nt one, which may be an indication\nthat the two expressions are at least partially synonymous. Conversely, even where closer\nexamination reveals that some occurrences of a term exhibit relevant diferences from\nothers, this w ill engender the impor tant insight that its Qur’anic usage falls into several\ndistinct types, which may require dif er ent translations.\n1", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is a curious and rather lam en ta ble state of afairs that there is both a comparative\nabundance of Qur’anic translations into En glish and other Eu ro pean languages and a gen-\neral dearth of accompanying linguistic and semantic annotation and argument. To be sure,\nsome translations do ofer a generous sel ection of brief notes (e.g., Asad 1980 and more\nrecently Droge 2013), and Rudi Paret’s German rendering (Paret 2001) is supplemented\nby a valuable volume of concise comments and Qur’anic cross- references (KK). More-\nover, Arne Ambros has compiled an indispensable dictionary of Qur’anic Arabic (CDKA).\nNonetheless, it remains a m atter of educated guesswork why some translators choose to\nrender, say, the phrase kull nafs as “ every soul” (thus, among others, Arberry 1955) while\nothers opt for “ every human being” (thus Asad 1980), “every/each person” (Droge 2013),\nor simply “every one” (Paret 2001 and also sometimes Droge 2013). The diference is not\nnegligible: given that the phrase at hand is often found in Qur’anic statements about death\nand the afterlife, the translation “ every soul” risks creating the inaccurate impression that\nthe Qur’an envisages the afterlife as something experienced by disembodied souls rather\nthan by concrete h uman beings who are, like pre- eschatological humans, endowed with\nbodies (see under → nafs).1\nIt is of course undeniable that some translational choices are bound to be a m atter of\nsubjective taste. Yet it would be wrong to start from the defeatist assumption that ques-\ntions such as the correct way of rendering rabb al- ʿālamīn or kull nafs are beyond the ken\nof philological argument, or to reduce the challenge of translating the Qur’an to the mere\ntask of conflating and stylistically improving upon existing renderings for the sake of more\nfluent readability. Instead, a concordantial examination of the Qur’anic corpus— one that\ndoes not limit itself to a verse’s immediate or wider context, but tries to understand par-\nticularly charged or difficult terms and phrases in light of other verses exhibiting relevant\nsimilarities in diction and phraseology—w ill often provide essential clues as to which of\ntwo or more translational options is more defensible.\nA concordantial analy sis of key Qur’anic terms and phrases is also of value beyond\nbeing an essential aid for the valid translation and interpretation of individual verses. Two\nseminal monographs by Toshihiko Izutsu have pioneered the approach that the Qur’anic\nunderstanding of God, the cosmos, and humankind (which Izutsu describes as the Qur’an’s\nWeltanschauung, or world- view) is usefully studied by means of a holistic analy sis of “se-\nmantic fields,” that is, groups of semantically related words (ERCQ and GMK; see also\nMadigan 2001, 79–85, and el Masri 2020, 7–8). Izutsu examines the semantic fields sur-\nrounding, and thereby also the meaning of, key Qur’anic terms like īmān (“belief”), islām\n(“self-s urrender” or “self- dedication” to God), kufr (“ingratitude” or “repudiation”), taqwā\n1 A recent contribution to Qur’anic translational criticism is Blankinship 2020.

By paying due attention to how such words behave in dif ere nt Qur’anic\ncontexts, an interpreter w ill be able to gain insight into crucial nodes in the conceptual\nnetwork sustaining Qur’anic discourse, and thereby also into some of the Qur’an’s central\ntheological, anthropological, and cosmological notions. Izutsuian semantic field analy-\nsis rests on the supposition that t here is a correlation between the ideas and doctrines\nadvanced by the Qur’an, on the one hand, and the semantics of the language— namely,\nQur’anic Arabic— that is employed to articulate t hese ideas, on the other. Thus, the way\nin which the Qur’an tends to collocate certain terms and phrases (e.g., the fact that the\nword → maraḍ, “sickness,” always co- occurs with → qalb, “heart”), relationships of full\nor partial synonymity and polarity (e.g., the opposition between “guidance,” → h-d -y ,\nand “ going astray,” → ḍ- l- l), or the referential range of a given term in its vari ous contexts\nof appearance (e.g., the fact that both natu ral and historical phenomena are designated\nas divine “signs” or → āyāt) are all potentially reflective of impor tant facets of Qur’anic\ntheology (see the valuable overview of what to look out for in semantic analy sis in ERCQ\n37–41). Of course, in tracking the behaviour of a given Qur’anic phrase or term one will\ncome across passages that are beset by ambiguity. For instance, in the case of conjunctive\nstatements— such as the stock phrase “ those who believe and do righ teous deeds” (al-\nladhīna āmanū wa-ʿ amilū l-ṣ āliḥāti; → ṣāliḥ)—it is often not immediately obvious w hether\nthe two concepts conjoined should be understood to be marked by semantic equivalence\nor at least overlap, on the one hand, or merely by some other, non-s emantic link, on the\nother.2 But in many cases, matters fall at least partially into place after one has examined\na reasonable sample of relevant occurrences. Also pertinent to a better understanding of\nthe Qur’anic world- view are other general observations that may be made about the be-\nhaviour of Qur’anic language, such as the frequency with which Qur’anic l egal stipulations\n2 One might baptise this the “equivocality of conjunction.” Consider, for example, the frequent combination\nof “performing prayer” (aqāma l-ṣ alāh) and “giving alms” (ātā l- zakāh; e.g., Q 2:43.83.110), on the one hand,\nand the threat in Q 70:17–18 that the fire of hell “calls the one who has turned his back and turned aside (man\nadbara wa- tawallā) // and who has gathered and hoarded (wa-j amaʿa fa-a wʿā).” The latter passage clearly pairs\nup synonyms: the verbs adbara and tawallā are variant expressions for one and the same act (namely, rejecting\nGod’s message), as are jamaʿa and awʿā (namely, selfish and eschatologically short- sighted accumulation of\nearthly property). By contrast, prayer and almsgiving are two separate activities that are neither synonyms nor\nhave any inherent semantic connection: the idea of the one does not entail the idea of the other at the level of\nlinguistic meaning. In between these two poles, there are cases in which a conjunctive statement pairs up two\nexpressions A and B that difer in meaning or sense but have the same referent. Thus, at Q 21:48 the Qur’an’s\ndivine voice declares that “we gave Moses and Aaron salvific divine instruction (→ al-f urqān), illumination,\nand reminding exhortation (dhikr; → dhakkara) for the God- fearing”; it seems quite pos si ble or even likely\nthat all three expressions are dif er ent descriptions of one and the same pro cess of divine revelation. Hence,\nconjunctive statements can conjoin words that are partly or entirely identical in meaning, words that are iden-\ntical in reference, or words that are linked merely in doctrinal or normative or empirical fact (e.g., because God\ndemands that p eople both pray and give alms, or b ecause prayer and almsgiving are in fact hallmarks of a pious\ndisposition and therefore tend to co- occur in human individuals). The question then arises whether, say, the\nfrequent combination of believing and doing righ teous deeds amounts to a conjunction of semantically cognate\nconcepts or whether they resemble the coupling of prayer and almsgiving, meaning that the two ele ments are\nconceptually separate but have some doctrinal, normative, or empirical link. It seems to me that the best general\nresponse to this quandary is to resist an overly rigid distinction between semantic and non-s emantic conceptual\nconjunction. For example, even though prayer and almsgiving do not have a necessary semantic connection, the\nfact that the Qur’an so frequently couples them must indicate that the nexus between them, whether semantic\nor non- semantic, is real and robust: those who pray ought to give alms as well, and many of those who pray are\nin fact also almsgivers (e.g., Q 9:71). Moreover, the frequent combination of both concepts would have disposed\nhearers of the Qur’an to associate them with one another.\nIntroduction 3", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Clearly, one and the same language can be used to express\nradically incompatible world- views.3 Nonetheless, the meaning of words is shaped by the\nways in which they are repeatedly and conventionally used; and it is certainly plausible to\nexpect that impor tant theological or anthropological tenets, such as the Qur’an’s binary\ndivision of humankind into believers and unbelievers, correlate with specific patterns of\nlinguistic usage, such as the Qur’anic employment of kafara as an antonym of āmana.\nWhile it is often easy to read seemingly self- evident assumptions about, say, the Qur’anic\nunderstanding of h uman personhood into individual passages, a reasonably comprehensive\nattempt to track and work through, say, Qur’anic instances of the words → qalb (“heart”)\nand → nafs (which in many verses designates what one may call humans’ “lower” or “vital\nself”) as well as impor tant terms that tend to be linked with them w ill provide vital safe-\nguards against the overinterpretation or misconstrual of individual occurrences. Luckily,\nthe Qur’anic corpus is both sufficiently large in order for the concordantial analy sis of many\nterms and phrases to yield promising results, and sufficiently limited in scope in order for\nsuch an endeavour to remain feasible even without devoting a monograph- length study\nto each concept under investigation.\nThe preceding reflections suggest that a comprehensive historical- critical reading of\nthe Qur’anic corpus will preferably proceed in two complementary dimensions: on the\none hand, a sequential (or, to put it in Saussurian terms, syntagmatic) verse- by- verse and\nsection- by- section analy sis of entire surahs, following the basic par ameters of a Qur’anic\ncommentary (tafsīr); and, on the other hand, an examination of key vocabulary recurring\nthroughout the Qur’an that may well draw inspiration from premodern Islamic dictionaries\nof the Qur’an like al-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī’s al-M ufradāt fī gharīb al-Q urʾān. These two di-\nmensions evidently link up to form a hermeneutic circle: a sound understanding of a given\nQur’anic passage may require considerable concordantial research, but the latter will in\nturn depend on a sound understanding of individual passages, requiring at least a certain\ndegree of sequential interpretation. All t hings considered, it seemed easier to break into\nthe hermeneutic circle by beginning with a dictionary of key Qur’anic terms, especially\ngiven that parts of the Meccan Qur’an have now received a first commentarial treatment\nat the hands of Angelika Neuwirth (PP and Neuwirth 2017). I am nonetheless u nder no\nillusion that some of my conclusions in what follows w ill almost certainly require revision\nin light of future studies of specific verses and passages.\nAs illustrated by my nod to at al- Rāghib al- Iṣfahānī in the preceding paragraph, the\nimportance and value of a concordantial analy sis of scriptural language is far from a novel\ninsight.

Modern Biblical\nscholarship in par tic ul ar has taken a close interest in scriptural diction that is recurrent and\ntheologically laden, as attested by multi-v olume reference works such as the Theological\nDictionary of the New Testament (TDNT), whose German original was edited by Gerhard\nKittel and Gerhard Friedrich between 1933 and 1979. The politics of Kittel, a member of the\nNazi party and author of a pamphlet on the “Jewish question,” were deplorable (Ericksen\n1977; Ericksen 1985, 28–78; Gerdmar 2009, 417–530), and at least some contributions to\nthe TDNT have been found to display anti- Semitic bias (Casey 1999; see also Rosen 1994\nand Gerdmar 2009, 474–478). The work’s methodology has moreover attracted forceful\ncriticism from James Barr (Barr 1961, 206–262). Nonetheless, the TDNT was pioneering\nin its attempt at comprehensively embedding New Testamental language in its complex\nhistorical setting: its entries survey how a par tic u lar word or word group are employed\nin ancient Greek texts, pre sent equivalents in Biblical Hebrew and their rendering in the\nSeptuagint, discuss relevant material from the Pseudepigrapha, the Qumran scrolls, and\nrabbinic and Hellenistic Jewish texts, and then go on to outline New Testamental usage,\noften distinguishing between dif er ent parts of the New Testament canon.4 The Hebrew\nBible has been the object of similar dictionary proje cts, such as the Theological Dictionary\nof the Old Testament (TDOT) and the New International Dictionary of Old Testament The-\nology and Exegesis (NIDOTTE). Likewise, modern Western scholarship on the Qur’an,\nthough far more modestly stafed than its Biblical cousin, has investigated the continuity\nof Qur’anic language with pre- Qur’anic usage: pioneers like Josef Horovitz or Karl Ahrens\nhave demonstrated that the meaning of key terms in Qur’anic Arabic must be understood\nagainst the background of cognate words in Hebrew, Jewish Aramaic, or Syriac, as well\nas approximate semantic equivalents in Greek, while Izutsu pays par tic u lar attention to\nsemantic shifts between the use of a given term in pre- Qur’anic poetry and in the Qur’an.5\nThe pre sent book, therefore, is an attempt to undertake a concordantial and histori-\ncally oriented analy sis of key Qur’anic terms, a “key” term being understood as one that\nis comparatively frequent (subject to the qualifications set out in the preface) and has\nwhat one may broadly call “religious or theological significance” (TDNT 1:vii). The essays\nmaking up the dictionary’s entries combine, in varying proportions, properly semantic\ninvestigations (i.e., attempts to delineate the putative meaning, or meanings, of a given\nArabic word or phrase and to ofer guidance on how best to translate it) with attempts at\nproviding a succinct synthesis of what the Qur’anic corpus as a whole says in employing\nthe word or phrase in question.6 Although the conceptual substructure of the Qur’an often\n4 See the remarks in TDNT 9:v on how the format of the dictionary evolved over the forty-y ear period of\nits genesis.\n5 For a cautionary assessment of Arthur Jefery’s view that the Qur’anic lexicon contains numerous loanwords\nspecifically from Syriac, see van Putten 2020b, 69–72, arguing that Aramaic loanwords in Qur’anic Arabic predate\nimpor tant phonetic develoments in Classical Syriac, especially begadkepat spirantisation. Even though it is not\ncertain that we may expect loans from Syriac to exhibit begadkepat spirantisation (Al- Jallad 2020a, 163–168), I\nhave sympathy for the claim that much of the Qur’an’s Aramaic- derived vocabulary is very old. In any case, even\nwords loaned from an early version of Aramaic and even words that are native to Arabic might still have been\nafected by the semantics of a Syriac cognate (see, e.g., u nder → kafara). The importance of Syriac Chris tian ity\nfor the Qur’an is, in my view, sufficiently demonstrable simply on the basis of doctrinal and phraseological ob-\nservations (see, e.g., u nder → rūḥ) and does not require corroboration by means of specifically Syriac loanwords.\n6 Especially in view of Barr’s warning against the fallacy of “illegitimate totality transfer” (Barr 1961, 218), it\nis impor tant to underline that these two are not the same thing.

I therefore endeavour to\ncombine a panoramic interest in patterns of meaning and usage across the entire Qur’an\nwith sensitivity to semantic shifts and developments between dif er ent surah groups, i.e.,\nbetween early and l ater Meccan surahs or between Meccan and Medinan ones.7 But I do\nnot invariably organise my data chronologically, since there are many cases in which a\nsynchronic taxonomy is more illuminating. The understanding of inner- Qur’anic chronol-\nogy and the criteria for dating Qur’anic surahs and passages relative to one another that\nis presupposed in the pre sent volume is developed in detail elsewhere (HCI 111–137). In\npar tic u lar, it should be noted that my use of the category “early Meccan” marginally di-\nverges from the well-k nown surah chronology of Weil and Nöldeke, in so far as it counts\nas “early Meccan” a number of surahs (e.g., Q 26 or Q 37) that Weil and Nöldeke classify\nas “ middle Meccan” (see HCI 161). Throughout, I employ the expression “l ater Meccan”\nto refer to all Meccan surahs that are not early.\nIn keeping with the work of pred ec es sors like Horovitz and Izutsu but also with the\napproach of the Biblical reference works named above, I pay relatively ample attention to\npos sib le antecedents of Qur’anic terms and phrases in Biblical and later Christian and Jewish\nlit er a ture, early Arabic poetry, or Arabian epigraphy. To forestall any misunderstanding of\nwhat I am hoping to achieve by including such comparative material, I would endorse the\nview that the putative etymology of a scriptural term and the meaning of its cognates in other\nlanguages do not normally s ettle its meaning in the scriptural corpus u nder consideration,\nan insight of James Barr’s whose pertinence to Qur’anic studies has been duly underscored\nby Walid Saleh (see Barr 1961, 107–160; Saleh 2010, especially 653, citing Barr 1968, 90;\nSaleh 2015). The main evidential basis on which to ascertain the meaning of a Qur’anic term\nmust be its usage within the Qur’an; and it is quite pos sib le that in seeking to characterise a\nword’s semantic role in the Qur’an the word’s etymology w ill prove to be of l ittle more than\nantiquarian interest.8 However, t here are instances in which the semantic role of a Qur’anic\nterm remains ambiguous even after careful inspection of the relevant Qur’anic data or in\nwhich the Qur’anic data exhibit alignment or telling contrasts with the way in which the\nword at hand or a cognate of it function in texts that are prior to or contemporaneous with\nthe Qur’an. In such cases, extra- Qur’anic usage can ofer impor tant clues for determining,\nor at least sharpening our understanding of, Qur’anic meaning.\nExtra- Qur’anic parallels can, moreover, shed light on the question of w hether a given\nterm or phrase was in use prior to the Qur’an, an issue of some importance for anyone\nmaintains that the Qur’an does not consider God to be an immaterial being, I do not mean to suggest that this is\na feature of the very meaning of the Qur’anic word allāh; it is simply an impor tant part of the vari ous things the\nQur’an says by using the word allāh. Indeed, I would concede that the basic linguistic meaning of the expres-\nsion allāh in the Qur’an’s late antique environment was the same irrespective of w hether it was employed by\nArabic-s peaking Christians or Jews or pagans or Qur’anic believers, despite the fact that all four would have been\ncommitted to at least some conflicting theological views. Yet despite this caveat, it is nonetheless informative\nto place individual Qur’anic statements using the divine name allāh against the background of the full gamut\nof what the Qur’an has to say about God, especially if one assumes (as I think one o ught to) that the Qur’anic\ncommunity throughout all of the text’s dif er ent periods retained a significant degree of familiarity with Qur’anic\nproclamations promulgated at earlier times.\n7 On the significance of chronological considerations for the semantic analy sis of Qur’anic terms and the\nneed to allow that semantic change across the Qur’anic corpus might be cumulative rather than a sequence of\nsemantic shifts, see Waldman 1968, 442–443.\n8 For two examples, see Saleh 2015, 35–36.\n6 Introduction", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The pre sent work, for one, is\nanimated by a strong interest in uncovering, wherever pos si ble, glimpses of the historical\nemergence of the Qur’an’s anthropological, cosmological, and theological lexicon. As rec-\nognised by scholars like Izutsu and, more recently, Alan Jones (EAP), pre- Islamic poetry\ncan be particularly valuable as a contrastive foil to the Qur’an, since pivotal Qur’anic terms\nlike → ummah (“community”), → āyah (“sign”), → al-d unyā (“proximate t hings” or, more\nfreely, “this life”), → dīn2 (in the sense of “religious worship”), or rizq (God’s “provision”;\nsee under → razaqa) are all attested in poems credibly attributed to pre-I slamic authors.\nA particularly good illustration of the importance of poetry is the notion of the → nafs\nor “vital self.” Both the Qur’an and early Arabic poetry associate the nafs with a range\nof appetitive and aversive mental phenomena that human agents must strive to restrain\nand keep in check in order to assert their commitment to ethical or religious values and\nprinci ples. Hence, the Qur’anic understanding of human psy chol ogy displays demonstra-\nble continuity with that current in pre- Qur’anic poetry, despite the substantial diference\nthat other wise exists between the two corpora in terms of their general world views and\ntheir thematic preoccupations. Another germane example is the verb → khalada, “to be\nimmortal, to remain forever.” The Qur’an uses it in formulaic phrases stressing that the\ninhabitants of paradise and of hell w ill “perpetually remain” in their allotted eschatologi-\ncal station. Pre-I slamic poetry, by contrast, employs khalada and other derivatives of the\nsame consonantal root in statements highlighting the ephemerality of human existence\nand humans’ ultimately futile striving for permanence and immortality. As detailed in\nthe relevant entry, the Qur’anic use of khalada is therefore a counterpoint to aspects of\npre- Qur’anic poetic discourse in Arabic. Nonetheless, it is vital to assess every word on\nits own merit, as exemplified by the word → rūḥ, “spirit”: although the term does figure\nin early poetry, its usage in the Qur’an is far more reminiscent of its Syriac cognate rūḥā.\nIn extending one’s comparative horizon beyond early Arabic poetry, Arabian epigraphy\nis an obvious supplementary resource, and one that is increasingly accessible beyond a nar-\nrow circle of specialists, thanks to databases like the Online Corpus of the Inscriptions of An-\ncient North Arabia (http:// krcfm . orient . ox . ac . uk / fmi / webd / ociana), directed by Michael\nMacdonald and based at the Khalili Research Institute in Oxford, and the online Sabäisches\nWörterbuch, directed by Norbert Nebes at the University of Jena (http:// sabaweb. uni- jena\n. de /S abaweb / ). Take, for example, the noun → khalīfah, which the Qur’an applies to Adam\n(Q 2:30) in lieu of his Biblical characterisation as God’s “image and likeness” (Gen 1:26).\nAs is well known, the post- Qur’anic Islamic tradition informs us that khalīfah can mean\neither “deputy” or “vicegerent,” on the one hand, or “successor,” on the other. Transla-\ntors of the Qur’an have mostly taken their pick based on context and perhaps also based\non other occurrences of the root kh- l- f in the Qur’an.9 But it is only in light of epigraphic\ndata that a compelling argument for one or the other choice becomes pos si ble: as Ruben\nSchenzle has reminded us (Schenzle 2017, 141–142), an inscription by the South Arabian\nking Abraha from March 548 CE employs a Sabaic equivalent of the noun khalīfah (spelled\nḫ- l- f- t) and its plural (ḫ- l- y- f, corresponding to khalāʾif) in a sense that scholars of Sabaic\ngloss as “viceroy,” “governor,” or “commander”; and the same inscription contains a verb\n9 For Q 2:30, “deputy,” “vicegerent,” or the like are generally the more popu lar option; but Paret 2001 at\nleast opts for the German equivalent of “successor.” As explained in the relevant entry, this choice is motivated\nby his awareness of other Qur’anic occurrences of the singular khalīfah, its plurals khalāʾif and khulafāʾ, and the\nverb istakhlafa.\nIntroduction 7", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Assmann\n2000, 29–30). Another case where Sabaic epigraphy provides vital contextual background\nis the basmalah (→ ˻bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm).\nThe question of w hether a given expression of Qur’anic Arabic was in use before the\nQur’an is particularly relevant in cases in which the expression u nder consideration has an\nidentifiable counterpart in a language utilised by late antique Christians and Jews, such as\nHebrew, rabbinic Aramaic, or Syriac. Did the Arabisation of the concept at hand coincide\nwith the Qur’anic proclamations, which would presuppose some kind of direct contact\n( whether oral or written) between members of the Qur’anic milieu and languages other\nthan Arabic, or had the respective word entered the Arabic language at an e arlier point in\ntime?10 As will become clear from many of my entries, it is often the second scenario that\nstrikes me as the correct one: rather than itself being an impor tant catalyst of Arabisation,\nthe Qur’an is drawing on established religious language, albeit in order to articulate its\nown distinctive theology (though I hasten to add that this is not to argue against first- hand\ncontact between the Qur’anic community, on the one hand, and Arabophone Jews and\nChristians, on the other). Not only are there reasons to assume that the Qur’an’s Biblical\nonomasticon is older than the Islamic scripture (see under → isrāʾīl); my general sense is\nalso that significant portions of the wider lexicon of Qur’anic Arabic preserve terminol-\nogy and phraseology that had been coined, in the preceding c entury or centuries, among\nArabic- speaking Jews and Christians, who would have orally articulated aspects of their\nbeliefs and practices in Arabic even if they continued to worship and to read scripture in\nother languages (thus already Hoyland 2017, 39–40). Such a scenario certainly accords with\nthe tendency of recent scholarship to emphasise Arabia’s gradual integration into the late\nantique world in the centuries preceding the Qur’an.11 Although the entries that follow are\nmostly s ilent on the larger historical pro cesses standing b ehind the assimilation of Biblical\nconcepts and language into Arabic that made the Qur’anic proclamations pos sib le, I would\nhighlight that the study of key Qur’anic terms and phrases provides evidence for what\nMichael Pregill has called the “indigenization of mono the ist scriptural and parascriptural\ntraditions” (Pregill 2020, 32) in pre- Qur’anic Arabia. In this sense, I embrace the tradi-\ntional premise that the Qur’an was proclaimed in Arabic, and that Qur’anic terms that are\nultimately borrowed from other languages, especially from t hose used by late antique Jews\nand Christians, had by the time of Muhammad become part and parcel of the established\nlexicon of Old Arabic, even if our direct access to the latter remains fragmentary.12\n10 See, e.g., the discussion in FVQ 19–22 and the comment thereon in van Putten 2020b, 70, n. 16.\n11 For an eloquent and admirably concise sketch of the Qur’an’s likely historical background, see Pregill\n2020, 31, postulating “that the general integration of formerly more marginal socie ties into the Roman and\nPersian cultural and po liti cal spheres of influence that dominated the Mediterranean and Near Eastern worlds\nprovided the concrete circumstances u nder which the adaptation and assimilation of concepts, convictions, and\nidentity markers associated with the dominant religious cultures of Late Antiquity occurred in Arabia.” For an\nattempt to spell out aspects of how I myself imagine the Qur’an’s historical milieu, see HCI 59–77, integrating\nmuch recent work by others.\n12 See especially the statement by Ibn ʿAṭiyyah that is cited in al- Suyūṭī 1426 AH, 936 (nawʿ 38).\n8 Introduction", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Plausible candidates for this joint category are the verbs → āmana, “to\nbelieve,” and → kafara, “to repudiate” (even if Christians have generally been more preoccu-\npied with definitions of correct belief than Jews) or the Biblical meta phors of “guidance” and\n“straying” and of God’s “path” (→ hadā, → ḍalla, → ṣirāṭ). Other Qur’anic terms, however,\nmay be considered to be confessionally distinct. For instance, the adjective → ummī, “scrip-\ntureless,” and the nouns kaffārah, “expiation” (→ kaffara), and → al- sakīnah, used to mean\nsomething like “composure” in the Qur’an, are highly likely to derive from the language\nof Arabophone Jews. We may also assume that there was more than one pre- Qur’anic\nChristian Arabic lexicon, depending on the linguistic and doctrinal type of Chris tian ity\nthat had spread among a given section of the Arabian population. Comparing a Sabaic in-\nscriptions by the Christian ruler Sumūyafaʿ Ashwaʿ from the early 530s with Abraha’s Mārib\nDam inscription from 548 CE, Christian Robin notes a shift from Christian terminology\nthat is derived from Ethiopic to terminology derived from Syriac (Robin 2015a, 153–154):\nin the former case “Christ” is called krīstos (krs3ts3) and the “Holy Spirit” manfas qәddūs\n(mnfs1 qds1), whereas Abraha employs Sabaic counter parts of Syriac mshīḥā (ms1ḥ) and\nrūḥā d-qūdshā (rḥ qds1; CIH, no. 541, ll. 1–3). Th ese latter two terms are what we find in\nQur’anic Arabic (→ al- masīḥ, → rūḥ al- qudus), but t here is nonetheless a tangible Ethiopic\nimprint on some of the Qur’anic terminology relating to Christ iani ty or religious m atters\nmore generally: the disciples of Jesus are called al-ḥ awāriyyūn, from Ethiopic ḥawārәyān,\nnever rusul (which would be the literal equivalent of Syriac shlīḥē; see u nder → rasūl); one\nof the chief Qur’anic terms for hell, → jahannam, may well have its immediate ancestor in\nEthiopic gahannam or gāhannam; and the Qur’anic word for “the Gospel” or perhaps the\nChristian Bible in its entirety, → al- injīl, was almost certainly mediated via Ethiopic wan-\ngel. Th ere is no compelling reason to suppose that, say, rūḥ al- qudus and al-ḥ awāriyyūn\nbelonged to one and the same Christian Arabic lexicon: they may well have reached the\nQur’anic milieu from dif ere nt Christian communities, some of which had been evange-\nlised by Syriac-s peaking missionaries while o thers w ere, or had at some point been, u nder\nAxumite or Ethiopic cultural influence. Overall, one might view the Qur’an as a linguistic\nfusion reactor merging vario us discrete strands of pre- Qur’anic Arabic—poetic language,\nlanguage reflecting indigenous tribal values and native Arabian pagan cults, language com-\nmon to dif ere nt branches of the Biblical tradition, language specific to certain Jewish and\nChristian communities rather than o thers—i nto the foundational layer of the language of\nIslam as a discursive tradition stretching across time and space.\nAlthough the pre sent dictionary initially emerged from an interest in key terms and\nphrases that occur in the Qur’an’s first three surahs, all of the terms discussed in what fol-\nlows are examined across the entire Qur’anic corpus. During the course of its gestation,\nthe dictionary has, moreover, come to include many additional expressions that do not\nfigure in Surahs 1–3. As highlighted in the preface, many words that have not been accorded\nin de pen dent entries of their own are discussed—s ometimes cursorily, sometimes at much\ngreater length—in connection with other terms with which they bear a close phraseological\nor semantic relationship. Thus, it proved con ven ient to make use of the entry on → dhabaḥa\nto review a range of Qur’anic expressions related to animal sacrifice, in the interest of per-\nmitting a more coherent view of the general topic of sacrifice in the Qur’an.

The pre sent dictionary does,\nhowever, have articles on impor tant group names, such as the Israelites (→ banū isrāʾīl),\nJews (→ al- yahūd), and Christians (→ al- naṣārā).\nFi nally, given that the work at hand is meant to provide some groundwork for f uture\ntranslational and commentarial work on the Qur’an, I should like to state my general pref-\nerence for attempting, as far as pos sib le, to render key Qur’anic terms by the same En glish\nterm throughout. Obviously, the meaning of words is crucially dependent on context,\nand there is no reason to make the optimistic assumption that the vocabulary of Qur’anic\nArabic can simply be matched, in a sort of pre- established harmony, to the vocabulary of\ncon temporary En glish. The purpose of an En glish dictionary of, say, ancient Greek has\nbeen insightfully described as providing En glish word- substitutions for Greek terms en-\nsuring that “in translating the Greek sentence into En glish the semantic contribution made\nby the Greek word w ill be approximately reproduced by the semantic contribution of the\nEn glish word” (Barr 1961, 215). As Barr adds, there will be many cases in which one and\nthe same Greek word—or, in our case, Arabic word— will need to be rendered by two or\nmore En glish terms. Qur’anic examples for this would be the noun dīn, which is used in the\ndistinct senses of “judgement” and “religion” (→ dīn1, → dīn2), or the construct expression\ndhikr allāh, which depending on context can mean both reminding exhortation by God\nand invocation of God (→ dhakara, → dhakkara).\nBut even though some Qur’anic terms must be rendered diferently depending on\ntheir context of occurrence, there is a strong reason for trying to keep such variation to\na minimum. This is because lexical recurrence— i.e., the repetition of complex phrases,\nindividual words, and consonantal roots—is a singularly crucial literary feature of the\nQur’an: it ensures the lexical cohesion of verse groups, surahs, and also the Qur’an as a\nwhole; it demarcates a surah’s constituent sections by means of devices such as inclusio\nor parallelism; and it signals impor tant links between non- adjacent passages in one and\nthe same surah as well as allusions to chronologically earlier Qur’anic proclamations (see,\ne.g., Zahniser 2000; Robinson 2001; Robinson 2003a, 201–223; Klar 2015; Reda 2017; Klar\n2017a and 2017b; HCI 97–98 and 150–153; Sinai 2018b; Daood 2019; Sinai 2022b).13 I would\nsubmit, therefore, that an adequate translation of the Qur’an o ught to opt for a unitary\ntranslation of one and the same Arabic term wherever this is pos si ble without distorting\ncontent, in the interest of enabling an En glish reader to appreciate a basic feature of the\nQur’an’s literary structure. Overall, this is much more feasible than replicating another\nkey literary feature of the Qur’an, rhyme. Nonetheless, t here are Qur’anic words for which\nsuch an attempt at unitary translation is doomed to fail. They include, for example, the\nextraordinarily polyvalent term → amr, which is found in more than half of the verses of\nSurah 65 (vv. 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 12) yet carries several dif er ent meanings, such as “com-\nmand,” “resolve,” “situation,” and “conduct.” This dictionary, then, is also an attempt to\ndelineate the minimum degree of polyvalence that must be acknowledged and negotiated\nin striving to implement the literary desideratum of a maximally (but not mindlessly)\nconsistent translation of key Qur’anic terms into En glish.\n13 On the related topic of etymological punning (that is, word play based on consonantal roots), primarily\nwithin individual verses and short verse groups, see Rippin 1994 and now also el Masri 2020 (e.g., 29–31, 69–70).\n10 Introduction", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is not meant to imply that I believe this\nversion to be inherently superior to o thers or to be an unfailingly accurate repre sent a tion of\nthe Qur’an’s original pronunciation. Apart from the fact that there is no reason for treating\nthe Kufan verse division as a priori more authoritative than other systems (Neuwirth 2007,\n11–62; Farrin 2019), linguistic research is now starting to show with increasing cogency that\nQur’anic Arabic likely difered at least in some re spects—s uch as its phonology or a lack of\nnunation and short case vowels— from Classical Arabic (Al- Jallad 2017b; van Putten 2017,\n2018, and 2022; van Putten and Stokes 2018; see also Larcher 2020). Th ere is accordingly no\navoiding a principled distinction between the received manner (or manners) of pronounc-\ning the Qur’an’s standard rasm, on the one hand, and the latter’s original pronunciation, on\nthe other, which latter w ill for the foreseeable f uture remain a topic of scholarly debate and\nhy po thet i cal reconstruction. Moreover, scholars have only begun to address w hether and\nto what extent the standard rasm deserves to be privileged over non- standard recensions\nof the Qur’an, for which manuscript evidence is still very scarce (Sadeghi and Bergmann\n2010; Sadeghi and Goudarzi 2012; see also Sinai 2020b and Hussain 2022a).\nSince the objectives of the pre sent dictionary are not linguistic or text- critical, I do\nnot hesitate to rely on the dominant Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim reading as my default version of the\nQur’an. This decision is motivated by con ve nience and not meant to fall foul of van Put-\nten’s convincing plea that the remaining reading traditions of the Qur’anic rasm, with their\nnoteworthy phonological and morphological features, are not simply “incon ve nient noise\nto be ignored” (van Putten 2022, 7). While more extensive attention to textual variants\nwould no doubt have been good scholarly practice, it would also have resulted in further\ninflating what is already a much more sizable volume than originally planned. Hence,\nI have only paid attention to textual variants when encountering significant interpretive\nprob lems. My hope is that the objectives of the pre sent book are adequately served even\nwithout extensive consultation of reading variants and manuscripts.

Since modern En glish unhelp-\nfully employs the same pronoun “you” and identical imperative forms for the singular and\nthe plural, I follow Jones in using the superscript letters S and p in order to signal the number\nof the Arabic verb, though I only have recourse to this device selectively, where necessary\nin order to dispel ambiguity. I do not capitalise pronouns referring to God, though I retain\nthe convention when quoting printed translations of some primary sources.\nEn glish quotations of Biblical passages are generally based on the New Revised Stan-\ndard Version, which I have on occasion felt free to modify. Names of Biblical books are\nabbreviated in accordance with SBLH 2 124–125. Chapter and verse references follow the\nBiblica Hebraica Stuttgartensia for the Hebrew Bible, the 28th edition of the Nestle- Aland\nedition for the New Testament, and the edition of Rahlfs and Hanhart for the Septuagint\n(all of which I have accessed via the software Accordance XII). As a consequence of this\napproach, my chapter- verse references to Biblical passages may sometimes exhibit minor\ndivergences from current En glish translations. The text of the Targumim and of the Pe-\nshitta for the Hebrew Bible I have accessed via the digital Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon\nProj ect (http:/ / cal . huc . edu / ); for the New Testament Peshitta, I have consulted the web-\nsite of Dukhrana Biblical Research (https: / / www . dukhrana . com / peshitta / ). References to\nthe Mishnah follow the text of the Bar Ilan Responsa Proj ect (https: / / www . responsa . co . il\n/ default . aspx).\nMy entries often accompany En glish citations of Qur’anic passages with generous\ndollops of transliterated Arabic, on the understanding that specialists will appreciate\nrapid access to the Arabic wording of the Qur’an alongside any translation. There is also\na fair amount of words and phrases transliterated from Biblical and rabbinic Hebrew,\nfrom targumic and rabbinic Aramaic, and from Syriac, as well as occasional material from\nClassical Ethiopic (Gәʿәz) and from inscriptions in Safaitic and Epigraphic South Arabian.\nUnfortunately, despite the fact that all of these are Semitic languages, transliteration\nconventions between them difer in some re spects. A scholar whose primary interests are\nlinguistic would no doubt have opted for a unitary and linguistically principled system of\ntransliteration even at the price of going against entrenched disciplinary customs. Being a\nscholar of the Qur’an myself, I have instead started from a variant of the standard manner\nof transliterating Arabic in English- language publications, and then extended some of its\nfeatures to the way I handle other Semitic languages. The result is the following system of\ntransliteration conventions, which tries to strike a tolerable compromise between those\nperpetual foes, consistency and established practice.\nFor Arabic, I largely adhere to the IJMES transliteration chart rather than that of the\nDeutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft (e.g., “shams” rather than “šams,” and “khatama”\nrather than “ḫatama”), and in keeping with this I do not represent assimilation of the\ndefinite article (e.g., “al-r abb” instead of “ar-r abb”). Word- initial glottal stops followed\nby a vowel are omitted in deference to ingrained habit, despite the entirely justified pro-\ntestations of linguists that hamzah is a fully fledged letter. Hamzat al-w aṣl is entirely\nignored, as opposed to being marked by an apostrophe (e.g., I have “fī l- arḍ” rather than\n“fī ’l- arḍ”). I also disregard that certain syllabic contexts necessitate that vowels written\n12 Conventions and Style", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

I similarly do not transcribe the lengthening of the third-p erson singular personal\nsuffixes - hu and -h i following an open or short-v owelled syllable (Fischer 2002, 7 and 142).\nI do, however, reflect the lengthening of short vowels at the end of verses of poetry (e.g.,\njaʿalā instead of jaʿala). Against IJMES conventions, I render tāʾ marbūṭah as - ah rather\nthan - a. I have deliberately opted for “nabiyy” instead of the more customary “nabī,” but\ncould not muster the reformationist fervour to extend the same logic to nisbah adjectives\nlike ummī and ʿarabī. Qur’anic and poetic verses and phrases are normally given with full\ndesinential endings for all words except for Qur’anic verse closers, where rhyme generally\nrequires that short desinential endings be omitted (e.g., the final word of Q 40:35 is to be\npronounced jabbār rather than jabbārin, as written). Arabic phrases that are excerpted\nfrom inside a Qur’anic or poetic verse are normally cited in their contextual rather than\npausal form, unless they are verse- final; thus, I have “bi- smi llāhi” rather than “bi- smi\nllāh,” but “bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm” (since raḥīm is the final word of Q 1:7 and loses\nits desinential ending in keeping with the princip les of Qur’anic rhyme).1 Single nouns\nand genitive constructions that are lifted from their syntactic context are often adduced\nwithout desinential endings.\nIn the interest of some uniformity, I have extended the omission of word-i nitial glottal\nstops from Arabic to Hebrew and Aramaic, though this may horrify Biblical scholars (e.g.,\n“ôt” rather than “ʾôt”). Other wise, I handle Biblical Hebrew in accordance with the “aca-\ndemic style” outlined in SBLH 2 56–58, which notably ignores begadkepat spirantisation.\nFor post-B iblical (i.e., targumic, rabbinic, and modern) Hebrew, I simplify this approach\nby abandoning distinctions between long and short vowels other than segol and ṣērē (e vs ē)\nand between plene and defective spellings of vowels, and by replacing š by sh (thus, I refer\nto “Midrash Tanḥuma”). Vocal shәwa and ḥaṭēp vowels (ă, ӗ, ŏ) are however retained, and\nword- final hē is transliterated -h (e.g., “torah”). Unlike Biblical Hebrew, for post-B iblical\nHebrew I also separate of the definite article, conjunctions, and prepositions by means\nof a hyphen, as customary for Arabic (e.g., “ha - raḥăman,” in contrast with Biblical “haššā-\nmayim”). Gemination, which is not pronounced in modern Hebrew, is retained for gem-\ninated verbs and associated forms (e.g., “mǝshattēp”) but not for the definite article (e.g.,\n“ha- mǝshattēpim,” not “ham- mǝshattēpim”).\nFor Syriac, I mostly follow the system in Wheeler M. Thackston, Introduction to Syriac:\nAn Elementary Grammar with Readings from Syriac Lit er at ure (Bethesda: Ibex Publishers,\n1999), which dispenses with word- initial glottal stops and disregards spirantisation but re-\ntains gemination. I modify this by employing sh instead of š, as for Arabic and post-B iblical\nHebrew, and by using ī and ū instead of i and u (which are invariably long). Following David\nKiltz, I render the Syriac word meaning “God” allāhā rather than alāhā (Kiltz 2012, 41). As\nregards post-B iblical Jewish Aramaic, where vocalisation is often exceedingly uncertain\nanyway, I have normally opted for maximum simplicity: no distinction between long\nand short vowels, including segol and ṣērē; no distinction between plene and defective\n1 However, when referencing certain locutions in general, rather than citing a specific segment from a par-\ntic u lar Qur’anic verse, I do adhere to pausal vocalisation for nouns in the genitive. For instance, the dictionary\nincludes an entry whose heading is → ˻sāra fī l- arḍ (rather than fī l- arḍi).

Jacobi 1971, 93–94). With similar devotion to their ancestors, the\nQur’anic pagans insist on following “the custom of our forefathers” or, more literally, “that\nto which we have found our forefathers beholden/accustomed” (Q 2:170: mā alfaynā ʿa-\nlayhi ābāʾanā; 5:104, 31:21: mā wajadnā ʿalayhi ābāʾanā), rather than following “what God\nhas sent down” (mā anzala llāhu).2 The Qur’anic pagans’ conviction that the practice of\ntheir forebears had normative force resonates with a verse from the Muʿallaqah of Labīd\n(ʿAbbās 1962, no. 48:81 = EAP 2:199; see Bravmann 1972, 165), in which the poet boasts of\nbelonging to a “tribe (maʿshar) whose forefathers have established a pattern of behaviour\nfor them (sannat lahum ābāʾuhum); and e very p eople has its pattern of behaviour (sunnah)\nand model (imām).” It is, of course, in no way certain that the verse just cited predates the\nQur’an, given that Labīd died in the early Islamic period. But the line does not anachronis-\ntically go beyond the deference to ancestral authority that the Qur’an ascribes to its pagan\nopponents and may accordingly reflect a general facet of pre- Qur’anic Arabian tribalism.3\nThe Qur’an does not on the whole ofer compelling evidence of ancestor worship.\nQ 16:21 alleges that the deities venerated by the Qur’an’s pagan opponents are in real ity\n“dead, not alive, and do not know when they w ill be resurrected.” As Crone notes, this\ncould be read as presenting the deities in question as “mere h uman beings falsely deified”\n(QP 73); but even if that is correct, it only shows that the Qur’an is polemically casting the\ndeities of its opponents as mere mortals, not that the opponents whose rites are attacked\nwere themselves conscious of venerating mythical progenitors. Perhaps somewhat more\nconvincingly, Q 2:200 might be understood to disclose that the pre- Qur’anic ḥajj ritual\nincluded an invocation of ancestors or ancestral spirits, but again it is impossible to be\nvery confident.4 Hence, the Qur’an mainly envisages the Meccans’ forefathers as having\n2 See also the treatment of Q 7:71, 12:40, and 53:23 (all of which condemn the usage or veneration of “names\nthat youp and your forefathers have devised,” asmāʾ sammaytumūhā antum wa- ābāʾukum) under → ism.\n3 There is of course also the possibility of later insertion, but EAP 2:199 argues quite cogently, in my view,\nthat this is not likely. In de pen dence from the Qur’an is suggested especially by the verse’s use of the term sunnah:\nwhile the word does occur in the Qur’an (e.g., Q 8:38, 17:77, 33:38), it usually means the customary manner in\nwhich God has treated previous generations of humans (namely, by punishing them if guilty of unbelief and\nwrongdoing and sparing them if prepared to repent). Thus, sunnat al- awwalīn (e.g., Q 8:38, 35:43) is not the\nexemplary behaviour that was instituted or adhered to by the ancients, as one might assume in light of the line\nby Labīd, but rather God’s habitual manner of dealing with earlier generations. See CDKA 140.\n4 According to this reading, Q 2:200 commands the Qur’anic community, after having performed their ḥajj\nrites (manāsik; see under → dhabaḥa), to “invoke God as you [used to] invoke your forefathers, or more so” (fa-\ndhkurū llāha ka- dhikrikum ābāʾakum aw ashadda dhikran; → dhakara). At least the imperative udhkurū ought\nto be translated as “to invoke” rather than “to remember” or “to commemorate,” since the remainder of Q 2:200\ncondemns an inappropriate way of invoking God (“And some people say, ‘Our Lord, give to us in the proximate\nlife!’ ”) while the next verse instead recommends the formula, “Our Lord, give to us good in the proximate life and\ngood in the hereafter, and protect us from the punishment of the fire” (Q 2:201). Thus, the discussion revolves\naround concrete invocatory utterances rather than mere commemoration of God. Against this background, it is\nconceivable that the same understanding of dhakara also ought to govern our interpretation of the verbal noun\n18 ab", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is the continuation of such ancestral\nritual pre ce dent that Muhammad is perceived to endanger. He is accordingly rejected\nas “only a man who wants to turn youp away from what your forefathers were wont to\nserve” (Q 34:43: mā hādhā illā rajulun yurīdu an yaṣuddakum ʿammā kāna yaʿbudu ābāʾu-\nkum). The Qur’anic proclamations in turn dismiss their opponents’ forefathers as devoid\nof knowledge (Q 18:5) and as heeding the call of the devil or Satan (→ al- shayṭān; Q 31:21).\nMuhammad’s preaching thus squarely rejected the Meccan ancestors’ authority to set\nvalid prec ed ents in religious m atters. As the early Meccan passage Q 37:69–70 puts it with\nsardonic humour, the unbelievers “have found their forefathers g oing astray (innahum\nalfaw ābāʾahum ḍāllīn) // and there they are being driven on in their footsteps (fa- hum\nʿalā āthārihim yuhraʿūn)!” God, the text asserts, is not only “yourp Lord,” but also “the\nLord of yourp ancient forefathers” (Q 44:8: rabbu ābāʾikumu l-a wwalīn), insisting that\nvis- à- vis God all h umans occupy the same station (see also Q 26:26 and 37:126, where the\nsame phrase is used by Moses and Elijah).\nAncestral pre ce dent in Qur’anic messenger narratives. The same tenacious attach-\nment to ancestral tradition for which Muhammad’s opponents are taken to task is also as-\ncribed to vario us communities in the past. Thus, in the early Meccan verse Q 26:74—w hich\ntogether with Q 37:69–70 chronologically precedes all of the other material discussed in\nthis entry— the contemporaries of Abraham justify their veneration of idols (Q 26:71:\naṣnām; see under → dhabaḥa) by saying that “we found our forefathers d oing the same”\n(qālū bal wajadnā ābāʾanā ka- dhālika yafʿalūn). A parallel utterance is attributed to Abra-\nham’s people in Q 21:53 (“We found our forefathers serving them,” qālū wajadnā ābāʾanā\nlahā ʿābidīn, namely, the “images” or tamāthīl mentioned in v. 52). Similar to Q 37:69,\nquoted above, Abraham here responds by dismissing his opponents and their ancestors as\nbeing “clearly astray” (Q 21:54: fī ḍalālin mubīn). According to Q 10:78, the p eople of Lot\nask him whether he has “come to turn us away from the custom of our forefathers” (qālū\na- jiʾtanā li- talfitanā ʿammā wajadnā ʿalayhi ābāʾanā). Q 43:22–24 generalises that just as\ncontemporary unbelievers are determined to “let themselves be guided” by the exemplary\ncustom (→ ummah) of their forebears (vv. 22: wajadnā ābāʾanā ʿalā ummatin wa- innā ʿalā\nāthārihim muhtadūn; cf. again Q 37:70), so the same stance was inevitably taken by the\naffluent elite (mutrafūhā, on which see the remarks under → khatama and → istaḍʿafa)\nof each settlement or town (qaryah) to whom God has previously dispatched a warner\n(v. 23, repeating v. 22 but substituting muhtadūn by muqtadūn). The same historical gen-\neralisation is made in Q 14:10, where the “messengers” (rusul) sent to vario us past p eoples\nare said to have faced the accusation of intending to “turn” their addressees “away from\nwhat our forefathers w ere wont to serve” (an taṣuddūnā ʿammā kāna yaʿbudu ābāʾunā; note\nthe similarity to Q 34:43, quoted above). The opponents of the historic messengers Ṣāliḥ\n(sent to Thamūd), Shuʿayb (sent to Madyan), and Hūd (sent to ʿĀd) are also faulted for\nappealing to “what our forefathers served” (mā ±​<kāna> yaʿbudu ābāʾunā; see Q 11:62.87\nand 7:70). Employing the verb → ashraka, “to associate” (namely, other beings with\nGod), the allegedly universal h uman propensity to uphold ancestral traditions is moreover\ndhikr in the subsequent phrase ka- dhikrikum ābāʾakum, though the alternative translation “invoke God as you\ncommemorate your forefathers, or more so” can hardly be ruled out.

This is\npresented as a chief obstacle to acknowledgement of the conflicting truth claims conveyed\nby prophetic messenger figures. The Qur’an thus articulates what Jan Assmann, following\nTheo Sundermeier, has described as the tension between “primary” and “secondary”\nreligions— namely, the fact that “positive” or “founded” religions are “counter- religions”\nthat “had to confront and to reject a tradition” (Assmann 1997, 169).5 This tension is cast\nas a ubiquitous feature of religious history in the Qur’an.\nAncestral tradition and divine endorsement in Q 7:28, 6:148, 16:35, and 43:20. A\nnoteworthy and interpretively problematic variant on the same theme is found in Q 7:28,\nwhere the Qur’an’s opponents are alleged to justify the perpetration of “abominable deeds”\n(wa- idhā faʿalū fāḥishatan) by declaring that this was “the custom of our forefathers” (qālū\nwajadnā ʿalayhā ābāʾanā), which then appears to be equated with divine commandments\n(wa- llāhu amaranā bihā). Should one take this pronouncement to entail that the Qur’an’s\nopponents deemed their ancestral traditions to preserve and give access to divine revela-\ntions, just as the Qur’an considers the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb), i.e., Jews and\nChristians, to be recipients of past revelations that were subsequently handed down to the\npre sent (although perhaps not without distortion)?\nIn support of an affirmative answer, one may note that Muhammad’s pagan adversaries\ndo seem to have subscribed to certain entrenched preconceptions about what genuine\ndivine revelations would need to look like (→ ashraka). Nonetheless, it is overall unlikely\nto read Q 7:28 as manifesting a claim on the part of Muhammad’s antagonists that their\nancestral tradition gave them access to divine revelations, in the same way in which Jews\nand Christians might claim to stand in a traditionally mediated link to revelation. A fter all,\nthe Qur’an does not explic itly engage with any such claim on their part. Indeed, several of\nthe verses cited above are predicated on a straightforward opposition between ancestral\ncustom and “what God has sent down” (mā anzala llāhu; → nazzala), rather than on a\ndistinction between direct and indirect access to divine revelation (i.e., between revelation\nconveyed through prophecy and through tradition). Rather, Q 7:28 is best read as imply-\ning a counterfactual argument that is reported in more detail in Q 6:148 and 16:35 (and\nsimilarly 43:20): “Had God willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated\n[anything with him], and we would not have declared anything to be forbidden” (Q 6:148:\nlaw shāʾa llāhu mā ashraknā wa- lā ābāʾunā wa- lā ḥarramnā min shayʾin); “Had God willed,\nwe would not have served anything besides him, neither we nor our forefathers, and we\nwould not have declared anything besides him to be inviolable” (Q 16:35: law shāʾa llāhu\nmā ʿabadnā min dūnihi min shayʾin naḥnu wa- lā ābāʾunā wa- lā ḥarramnā min dūnihi min\nshayʾin).6 Such passages pre sent the pagans as responding to the Qur’anic Messenger’s\n5 For an e arlier formulation of the same insight, see William Robertson Smith’s distinction between positive\nand traditional religions in Smith 1894, 1–2.\n6 On the meaning of min dūnihi here, see Ambros 2001, 11–12; see also briefly u nder → ashraka.

The conflict between Abraham and his f ather is particularly foregrounded\nin Abraham’s sermon in Q 19:42–45, containing four occurrences of the vocative yā- abati,\n“O my f ather” (Sinai 2020a, 280), to which Abraham’s father replies by underlining his\ncommitment to his gods and by threatening his son with stoning (v. 46). The Qur’an thus\nportrays Abraham as the quin tes sen tial anti- paternal rebel, whose decisive break with\nancestral tradition is deployed in direct connection with the appeals to ancestral tradition\non the part of Muhammad’s adversaries (Q 43:19–29, with a total of five occurrences of\nthe words “ father” or “ fathers” in vv. 22, 23, 24, 26, and 29).\nThe Medinan surahs build on the Meccan image of Abraham as a paradigm of anti-\npaternal rebellion by elevating him to an efective founding figure of Qur’anic mono thei sm.\nMost importantly in the pre sent context, Q 22:78 calls upon the community of believers\nto adhere to the “teaching of yourp father Abraham” (millat abīkum ibrāhīma; → millah).\nIn this appeal, the erstwhile anti- paternal rebel Abraham is himself recast as a figure of pa-\nternal authority. The formulation has strong Jewish and Christian prec ed ent (e.g., m. Qidd.\n4:14 and Rom 4:1.11–12), and Q 22:78 is no doubt concerned to assert that the Qur’anic\nbelievers’ claim to Abraham is superior to that routinely staked out by Jews and Christians\n(see also Q 3:67–68). It is nonetheless striking that Q 22:78 expresses Abraham’s par-\nadigmatic importance for the Qur’anic community in paternal terms, given the Meccan\nsurahs’ strident criticism of their opponents’ appeals to ancestral authority.7 The idea that\n7 Donner 2019, 138–139, raises the possibility that this verse or part of it is an insertion postdating the\ndeath of Muhammad. However, Q 22:78 is contained in the manuscript Bibliothèque nationale de France Arabe\n328c, which has been identified as belonging to the same codex as Birmingham Mingana Islamic Arabic 1572a\n(Fedeli 2011, 50). Since the latter has been radiocarbon- dated to 568–645 CE, with a probability of 95.4%, it is\nnot unproblematic to associate the verse with ʿAbd al-M alik, as tentatively proposed by Donner.

A second context in which the term\najr is prominently used, to be discussed at the end of this entry, is the assertion in the\nMeccan surahs that God’s emissaries do not demand a “wage” from their audience and that\nthey w ill be exclusively remunerated by their divine sender.\nAjr = “wage.” Although the noun ajr is often translated as “reward,” it denotes more\nprecisely a “reward given for ser vice rendered” (Torrey 1892, 23), i.e., a “wage” (thus Ar-\nberry’s consistent rendering): ajara is “to serve for wages” (Q 28:27) and istaʾjara “to\nhire for wages” (Q 28:26; see Torrey 1892, 24, and CDKA 21), and a number of Qur’anic\npassages employ ajr or its plural ujūr to mean wages or pay in this-w orldly dealings be-\ntween humans (Q 7:113, 18:77, 26:41, 28:25), including cases in which ajr refers to dower\npaid by a groom to the bride (Q 4:24–25, 5:5, 33:50, 60:10, 65:6). Indeed, Arabic ajr has\nan Aramaic cognate agrā, which similarly signifies “hire, wages, fee, payment” and the\nlike (SL 8; DJBA 80–81).1 Hence, while the word ajr is clearly an approximate synonym\nof thawāb, “reward” (e.g., Q 3:145.148.195, 18:31.44.46), or jazāʾ, “recompense, requital”\n(e.g., Q 3:136, 4:93, 5:29.85, 9:95, 78:26.36), it is semantically distinctive in implicitly casting\nhumans as labourers contracted by God, labourers who w ill receive their due pay in the\nworld to come—“ How excellent is the wage of those who l abour!” (niʿma ajru l-ʿ āmilīn),\nthree verses exclaim (Q 3:136, 29:58, and 39:7).2 Moreover, whereas thawāb and jazāʾ are\nreadily used both for this-w orldly and other-w orldly reward (see, e.g., Q 3:145.148, 4:13 on\nthe former, and 2:85.191, 5:33.38.95 on the latter), ajr is mostly reserved for eschatological\nrecompense, although t here are exceptions, as shown by Q 12:56 (Joseph’s “wage” seems to\nbe equated with his God granting him an abode in Egypt) and 29:27 (stating that Abraham\nis not only among the righ teous “in the hereafter” but that he also received “his wage in\nthe proximate life,” ātaynāhu ajrahu fī l- dunyā).3\nQur’anic pledges of eschatological “wage.” Those who believe, do right eous deeds,\ngive charity, and perform prayer, etc., are promised that “their wage is with their Lord”\n(Q 2:62.112.262.274.277, 3:199: ajruhum ʿinda rabbihim) or “is incumbent upon their Lord”\n(Q 4:100, 42:40: fa- ±<qad waqaʿa> ajruhu ʿalā llāhi). The preposition ʿinda, “with,” in\nverses like Q 2:62 has an implication of eschatological communion with God (see in more\ndetail u nder → jannah). Other passages announce that God will “pay” peoples’ escha-\ntological wages “in full” (Q 3:57, 4:173: fa-y uwaffīhim ujūrahum; see also 3:185, 35:30,\n39:10, and in general Torrey 1892, 22–23) and that he will not “neglect to pay” (aḍāʿa)\nthe wages of those who believe (Q 3:171; see also, without the term ajr, 2:143) and who\ndo righ teous or good deeds (Q 7:170, 9:120, 11:115, 12:56.90, 18:30; see also, without the\nterm ajr, 3:195). Indeed, God will “give them more” than their due wage (Q 4:173, 35:30:\nwa- yazīduhum/yazīdahum; see also 24:38 and 42:26 for a similar use of zāda), and at least\nsome people will receive their wages “twice over” (marratayn; Q 28:54 and 33:31).4 A large\n1 According to FVQ 49, ajr is a borrowing from Syriac. But ʾgrt (cf. Arabic ijārah) is already attested in Sa-\nfaitic; see Al- Jallad 2015, 261 (with KRS 1563) and 297. It is notable that in KRS 1563, ʾgrt refers to compensation\nasked from a deity.\n2 The term ajr co- occurs with derivatives of ʿ-m -l in other verses as well, e.g., Q 16:96.97, 3:195, or 18:30.\n3 On the relationship between ajr, thawāb, and jazāʾ, cf. Torrey 1892, 25–26, who rejects “any sharp distinc-\ntion” between them as “artificial.”\n4 See also Q 6:160 (a good deed w ill be rewarded tenfold) as well as 27:89 and 28:84 (a good deed w ill be\nrewarded by “something better”). Verses like Q 4:40 and 34:37 announce that God w ill “double” or “multiply”\n(ḍāʿafa, on which see u nder → aqraḍa) people’s rewards or give them “double recompense” (jazāʾ al-ḍ iʿf; see\najr 23", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Other adjectives describing p eople’s eschatological\nwage are ḥasan, “good” (Q 18:2, 48:16), karīm, “generous” (Q 33:44, 36:11, 57:11.18), and\nghayr mamnūn, “not considered as an unearned favour” or “rightfully earned” (Q 41:8,\n68:3, 84:25, 95:6; see CDKA 259).5\nEschatological wage and divine forgiveness. It is salient that promises of eschatolog-\nical wages are repeatedly paired with promises of divine forgiveness (maghfirah; Q 5:9,\n11:11, 33:35, 35:7, 36:11, 48:29, 49:3, 67:12; see also the occurrence of ajr in proximity to\ndeclarations that God is “forgiving,” ghafūr, in 4:100.152, 35:30, and 73:20). The under lying\nrationale is spelled out in three Meccan passages (Q 29:7, 39:35, 46:16) that proclaim God’s\nleniency towards “ those who believe and do righ teous deeds” (Q 29:7: alladhīna āmanū\nwa-ʿ amilū l-ṣ āliḥāt) or who are God-f earing and do what is right (Q 39:33.34: al- muttaqūn,\nal- muḥsinūn): Q 39:35 declares that God w ill “absolve them of the worst of what they have\ndone” (li- yukaffira llāhu ʿanhum aswaʾa lladhī ʿamilū) and “recompense them with wage\naccording to the best of what they have done” (wa- yajziyahum ajrahum bi- aḥsani lladhī\nkānū yaʿmalūn; for more detail, see → kaffara), and the same point is made in Q 29:7 and\n46:16. Two consecutive verses in Surah 16 also assert that God w ill “recompense” those\nwho are patient (Q 16:96: la-n ajziyanna lladhīna ṣabarū) or who do righ teous deeds\n(Q 16:97: la- najziyannahum) “with wage according to the best of what they have done”\n(ajrahum bi- aḥsani mā kānū yaʿmalūn).\nHence, believers will receive the just compensation that is owed to them for their\nvirtuous deeds, whereas any sins they may have committed w ill not be punished accord-\ning to the dictates of strict justice but w ill instead be magnanimously efaced. Concomi-\ntant announcements of eschatological wage and of divine forgiveness (on which see also\nunder → al- raḥmān) accordingly reflect that the believers’ salvation is not exclusively a\nconsequence of their intrinsic desert, despite the repeated Qur’anic insistence that escha-\ntological reward w ill be apportioned like contractually stipulated pay for ser vices rendered.\nRather, it is ultimately the fact that h umans have previously entered into and maintained\na believing relationship with God that guarantees divine efacement or disregard of their\nsins, which are thus prevented from tarnishing their other- worldly prospering.\nGod’s “wage” in the Qur’an and the New Testament. Precursors for the Qur’anic prom-\nise of eschatological reward are found in the New Testament (Torrey 1892, 27), such as Matt\n5:12 and 6:1–6.16 and Luke 6:23.35. They employ the Greek word misthos, which like Arabic\najr means “hire, wages, payment” (e.g., Luke 10:7). Particularly significant are Matt 5:12 and\nLuke 6:23.35, according to which t hose who are persecuted like the prophets or who love\ntheir enemies, do good, and “expect nothing in return” w ill receive a “ great (polys) wage,”\nrecalling the frequent Qur’anic nexus between the noun ajr and the adjectives ʿaẓīm and\nCDKA 168–169). But note that similar statements are also made about eschatological punishment (Q 7:38, 11:20,\n25:69, 33:30.68, 38:61).\n5 An alternative interpretation would be to understand the verb manna, from which the passive participle\nmamnūn is derived, to mean “to withhold,” yielding the translation “wages that are not withheld,” as proposed by\nAlan Jones based on a line in the Muʿallaqah of Labīd (EAP 2:181–182). However, all non- participial occurrences\nof manna in the Qur’an mean “to bestow favours upon s.o.” (manna ʿalā) or “to consider it a favour to s.o. to do\ns.th.” (manna ʿalā, followed by an or an accusative); see CDKA 259.\n24 ajr", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is notable that the Syriac Peshitta renders misthos as agrā, the cognate of Arabic\najr. Meanwhile, Qur’anic verses describing God’s wage in the hereafter as something that\nis “rightfully earned” (ghayr mamnūn) may involve a distant resonance of Paul’s affirmation\nin Rom 4:4 (in the context of his exegesis of Gen 15:6) that “to one who works, wages are\nnot reckoned as a gift (kata charin ≈ mamnūn?) but as something due.”\nAs these parallels demonstrate, the Qur’an shares its use of commercial-t heological\nlanguage “with the general urban imagery employed in religious lit er a ture of the mono-\nthe istic Near Eastern world” (Rippin 1996, 133; see also CQ 49–50), ultimately g oing back\nto impor tant conceptual shifts in Second T emple Judaism like the understanding of sin\nas “a debt to be repaid” and of charitable deeds as “storable commodities” (see Anderson\n2009 and 2013). This deep intertextual background undermines Torrey’s assessment that\nthe Qur’anic use of commercial notions manifests the “deep- rooted commercial spirit”\nof “the Arab nature” (Torrey 1892, 50). A more relevant approach would be to focus on\nthe theological ramifications of the Qur’anic recourse to monetary meta phors, such as\nconceiving of eschatological salvation as God’s payment of a rightful wage. God, in his\ndealings with human agents, will exercise unfailing and scrupulous justice— and indeed\nwill go well beyond the expectations of fairness that are operative in h uman economic\ninteractions: he pays his servants twice their due wage and does not make deductions for\nany outstanding debts.6 Moreover, in being prepared to remunerate a finite quantity of\nthis- worldly righ teousness with eternal reward, God ofers uniquely favourable terms of\ntrade. Fi nally, the Qur’an’s deployment of economic meta phors drives home that h umans\nwho construct their daily lives around belief in posthumous divine compensation are not\ntaking an uncertain leap of faith but are instead making a profoundly rational choice.\nGod’s messengers do not demand human pay. A frequent trope linked to the word\najr is the recurrent insistence in Meccan surahs that Muhammad and God’s emissaries\nbefore him, such as Noah, did not or do not ask (saʾala) for a “wage” from their respective\naudience in return for conveying God’s warnings (Q 6:90, 10:72, 11:29.51, 12:104, 25:57,\n26:109.127.145.164.180, 34:47, 38:86, 42:23; see also 36:21, 52:40, 68:46). Rather, God’s\nemissaries will be compensated by God himself (Q 10:72, 11:29, 34:47: in ajriya illā ʿalā\nllāhi; similarly 11:51 and 26:109.127 etc.). Thus, God’s warners— unlike, for instance, the\nEgyptian sorcerers whom Phar aoh marshals to confront Moses (Q 7:113, 26:41)—a re not\nin the ser vice of humans but of God. Ahrens connects this with Matt 10:8, where Jesus\norders his disciples to “give without payment,” as well as a passage in the second- century\nShepherd of Hermas (Commandments 11:12) criticising the one “who receives wages for\nhis prohecy” (misthous lambanōn tēs propheteias autou; Ehrmann 2003, 2:288–289; see CQ\n161, BEQ 456, and Reynolds 2018, 659–660). This prophetological motif goes back as far\nas the Biblical condemnation of prophets who “give oracles for money” in Mic 3:11. That\nfalse prophets or teachers may be recognised by their ac cep tance or demand of material\nremuneration is also reiterated in other Christian texts, such as the Teaching of the Twelve\nApostles 11:9.12 (Ehrmann 2003, 1:434–437) and Ephrem’s sermon on Jonah and Nineveh\n(Beck 1970b, no. 1:701–702), where the Syriac word agrā is employed.7\n6 I am indebted to Usman Shaikh for helping me understand this point.\n7 For another occurrence of the topos, see the refutation of Montanism that is cited in Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical\nHistory 5:18:2–11 (Eusebius 1926–1932, 1:486–493).\najr 25", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The argument evidently\nreflects the increasing institutionalisation under gone by the early Christian church and\nthe consequent need to come to terms with some form of monetary remuneration for\nfull-t ime ministers. By contrast, Muhammad’s authority was in princi ple grounded in his\nprophetic charisma and not, like that of a Christian cleric, in his belonging to an ecclesi-\nastical hierarchy whose maintenance required regular financial support in return for the\nregular provision of religious teaching and other ser vices.\nIn the Qur’an’s Medinan period, however, Muhammad acquired responsibility for the\ncollection and re distribution of charitable donations (see Q 9:58–59.102–103 and 58:12–\n13; → ṣadaqah, → zakāh) and of military spoils (Q 8:1.41, 59:6–7). This could have made\nhim vulnerable to the complaint that his Medinan role v iolated the Meccan doctrine that\nGod’s messengers do not seek remuneration, which is perhaps the reason why statements\ndenying that Muhammad or other emissaries “asked for a wage” do not recur in the Me-\ndinan Qur’an (even though it is reasonable to suppose that Meccan denials that divine\nemissaries might claim wages continued to be known to the Medinan community). The\nfact that a number of Medinan passages contain cata logues of the vari ous categories of\nrecipients who are entitled to receive charitable assistance or a share of military spoils (see\nunder → zakāh) could also bespeak a desire to foreground that Muhammad’s acquisition\nof a quasi- fiscal role did not equate to “demanding wages” for himself, but instead served\nmerely to support community members in need (Sinai 2018a, 15). In highlighting the social\nrationale for Muhammad’s new prerogatives in Medina, the Qur’an sets him in implicit\nopposition to Jewish and Christian dignitaries, “many” of whom are roundly condemned\nfor “unjustly consuming people’s possessions” in Q 9:34. One might also consider whether\nthe stress in Q 59:6–7 that the Messenger’s spoils are efectively a gift from God (mā afāʾa\nllāhu ʿalā rasūlihi, “what God has granted his Messenger”) is to be read as an implicit appeal\nto the Meccan teaching that a warner’s legitimate wage will be disbursed by God himself.\najal | term\nFurther vocabulary discussed: musammā | named, specified, fixed i qtaraba intr. | t o\ndraw near ḥ isāb | reckoning, account w aʿd | promise; pledge a l- sāʿah | the hour\n(of the resurrection) a khkhara tr. | t o postpone s.th.; to reprieve s.o. k halada intr. |\nto remain forever al-d unyā | the proximate life al- ʿājilah | what is fleeting, what\npasses in haste m atāʿ ilā ḥīn | e njoyment u ntil a certain time m attaʿa tr.

Apart from its occasional appear-\nance in connection with mundane transactions or family matters, the word plays a cru-\ncial theological role, which will be described in more detail in what follows (see already\nsuccinctly Mir 1987, 17).1\nPhraseologically, ajal often collocates with the attribute musammā (“named, specified,\nfixed”; CDKA 139), which accompanies it both in the mundane context of money- lending\n(Q 2:282) and in theological or anthropological affirmations (e.g., Q 6:2). In one case, ajal\nhas the adjective maʿdūd (Q 11:104), “l imited” (CDKA 184). God’s “setting” (verb: jaʿala)\nof a “term” (ajal) also occurs in a poetic retelling of the creation of Adam attributed to\nthe Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd (al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 103:14; see Toral-N iehof 2008,\n247–248, and Dmitriev 2010, 373–374), although in a much less universal sense than in the\nQur’an: according to the poem, God “cursed” the serpent that seduced “his creation”—\nnamely, Adam and Eve— and did not place a time limit on this curse, meaning that the\ncurse was perpetual.\nAll of pre- eschatological creation has its term. God’s creation of humans and of the\ncurrently existing cosmos as a w hole is Qur’anically understood to have involved the setting\nof an ajal or term of existence. Thus, God primordially fashioned humans “from clay” and\n“then set a term (thumma qaḍā ajalan)— there is a specified term with him (wa-a jalun\nmusamman ʿindahu)” (Q 6:2; for other occurrences of ajal in connection with the creation\nof humans, see 17:99 and 40:67). More generally, the divine voice avers that “we only\ncreated the heavens and the earth and what is between them in truth and with a specified\nterm” (Q 46:3: mā khalaqnā l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍa wa- mā baynahumā illā bi- l-ḥ aqqi wa-\najalin musamman; see also 30:8).

The preordained term of the cosmos as a whole is\nclearly the day of judgement, when the heavenly bodies, including the sun and the moon,\nwill perish (Q 75:8–9, 77:8, 81:1–2, 82:2) and when h umans will, by their own words,\nhave “reached the term that you have set for us” (Q 6:128: wa-b alaghnā ajalanā lladhī\najjalta lanā, harking back to 6:2.60). At the individual level, h umans’ “specified term”\n(ajal musammā) is the moment of their death (Q 6:60, 39:42, 40:67; see also 3:145, where\nan individual’s death is called a kitāb muʾajjal, which one might render as a “fixed-t erm\ndecree”). After death, an individual’s ethico- religious balance sheet, on the basis of which\nhe or she will ultimately face God’s final judgement, will remain unalterably fixed. Thus,\nas Mir notes, the Qur’anic idea of ajal stresses “the finiteness of the period of time allotted\nto individuals and nations for moral action” (Mir 1987, 17).\nAs the preceding quotation from Mir intimates, h uman communities, too, have their\nspecified term (cf. Acts 17:26, noted in CQ 168 and BEQ 453), for which “they w ill be neither\nearly nor late” (Q 7:34, 10:49: li- kulli ummatin ajalun ±​<fa-> idhā jāʾa ajaluhum ±​<fa- >lā\nyastaʾkhirūna sāʿatan wa- lā yastaqdimūn, which is partly paralleled by 16:61; see also 15:5\nand 23:43: mā tasbiqu min ummatin ajalahā wa- mā yastaʾkhirūn). Just as the “term” of an\nindividual is not simply the moment of her demise but also the preamble to her resurrec-\ntion and her being called to account, so the “term” of a h uman collective is not merely the\n1 Such dual use is also encountered with other Qur’anic terms like → ajr, “wage,” and rizq, “provision”\n(→ razaqa).\najal 27", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This occurs either when a historical messenger figure, like\nNoah, urges a specific community to serve and obey God, on pain of immediate inner-\nhistorical retribution, or when God’s universal judgement fi nally irrupts into the world.\nThis collective dimension of the term ajal is exemplified by Q 7:185, threatening “t hose\nwho dismiss our signs as a lie” (v. 182) that “perhaps their term has drawn near” (ʿasā an\nyakūna qadi qtaraba ajaluhum). Pertinently, the verb iqtaraba, “to draw near,” elsewhere\ncollocates with God’s “reckoning” (→ ḥisāb; Q 21:1), with the “true pledge” (al- waʿd al-\nḥaqq; Q 21:97; see under → waʿada), and with “the hour” of the resurrection (→ al- sāʿah;\nQ 54:1). “As for those who expect to meet God: God’s term is coming (fa- inna ajala llāhi\nla-ā tin), and he is hearing and knowing,” declares Q 29:5, similarly employing the word\najal as a byword for the eschatological reckoning. Later on in the same surah (Q 29:53),\nit is said that “ were it not for a specified term, the punishment would come upon them\n[immediately],” and a number of passages combine the word ajal with the verb akhkhara\nto express the idea that God has granted h umans a temporary reprieve from his judgement\nand chastisement, thus enabling them to improve their prospects of passing eschatological\nmuster (e.g., Q 11:104, 14:10).2 Thus, Q 16:61 (see similarly 35:45) asserts: “If God w ere to\nchastise people for their wrongdoing, he would not leave behind any creature on earth\n(mā taraka ʿalayhā min dābbatin); yet he reprieves them u ntil a specified term (wa- lākin\nyuʾakhkhiruhum ilā ajalin musamman). And when their term comes, they will not be early\nby an hour nor late.”\nThe Qur’an sometimes depicts pivotal theological truths as reflected or prefigured\nby natur al phenomena. For instance, the dualism of moral right and wrong and of belief\nand unbelief, leading to two antithetical soteriological outcomes (namely, heaven and\nhell), is mirrored by cosmic dualities like day and night or male and female (Q 91:1–10,\n92:1–10; see PP 224 and 233–234, as well as SPMC 122–124), and hierarchical distinctions of\nrank exist not only in nature and in pre- eschatological human society but also in paradise\n(see under → darajah). In a similar vein, the notion of a preset end point of the created\norder, to be followed by the hereafter, is applied to an inner- cosmic natu ral pro cess like\nthe maturation of the human fetus: “we place in the wombs what ever we will until a\nspecified term (wa- nuqirru fī l- arḥāmi mā nashāʾu ilā ajalin musamman) and then bring\nyoup forth as children” (Q 22:5). L ater in the same surah, the addressees are reminded\nthat animals destined to be sacrificed during the ḥajj are “beneficial to you until a spec-\nified term, upon which their place of slaughter is near [or directed t owards] the ancient\nhouse” (Q 22:33: lakum fīhā manāfiʿu ilā ajalin musamman thumma maḥilluhā ilā l- bayti\nl- ʿatīq). Pre- eschatological being, one might be tempted to generalise in a Heideggerian\nregister, is inevitably being- towards- a- term. All of the entities and pro cesses constituting\nthe presently existing cosmos are characterised by non- perpetuity, by built-in obsoles-\ncence: created beings are temporally finite not only a parte ante, in so far as they have a\nbeginning in time, but also a parte post, in so far as they are destined to perish at some\nfuture time.3 In this, God’s pre- eschatological creation contrasts with the cosmic renewal\n2 On akhkhara, see generally CDKA 22. When used with a personal object, akhkhara is “to reprieve s.o.”\n(e.g., Q 63:11). When the object is the day of judgement of God’s ajal, the verb must be rendered “to postpone\nor delay s.th.” (Q 11:104, 71:4).

This contrast is explic itly drawn: the pre sent or “proximate” life\n(→ al- dunyā) is “fleeting” or “transient” (Q 17:18, 75:20, 76:27: al-ʿ ājilah), ofering h umans\n“enjoyment u ntil a certain time” (Q 2:36, 7:24, 16:80, 21:111, 36:44: matāʿ ilā ḥīn),4 while\nthe “final state of t hings” (→ al-ā khirah) ensuing after the day of judgement is the “abode\nof stability” (Q 40:39: dār al- qarār).\nHow unalterable is God’s term? In many cases, God’s “term” appears to be envis-\naged as immutably fixed: “for every term there is a written decree” (Q 13:38: li- kulli ajalin\nkitāb; see also 3:145). In Q 42:14, the respite that God is said to have granted t hose who\nhave become “divided” after receiving divine knowledge is called a “preceding word from\nyourS Lord [granting reprieve] u ntil a specified term” (kalimatun sabaqat min rabbika\nilā ajalin musamman; see similarly 20:129, where this “preceding word” is equated with\na “specified term”).5 But a statement like Q 42:14 only refers to the end of the world and\nthus to the term of the cosmos as a w hole, which is indeed plausibly viewed as primordi-\nally inscribed into God’s creation from the beginning, in line with statements like Q 6:2\nand 46:3 (see above).6 Should we suppose that the term of individuals and collectives is\nlikewise unalterably and primordially fixed? The Qur’an holds that t hose who face divine\npunishment or death will sometimes plead for an extension with God (Q 14:44, 63:10,\nwhere the request is for God to grant them reprieve for a short while, ilā ajalin qarībin; see\nalso 4:77, where the same demand is uttered in response to the commandment to fight).\nSuch pleas are not unfounded, in so far as some passages suggest that the arrival of God’s\nterm can be averted by h uman repentance and remorse. Thus, according to Q 14:10, God’s\nmessengers announce to their respective audiences that God “calls upon youp (yadʿūkum)\nso that he might forgive you some of your sins and reprieve you until a specified term\n(wa- yuʾakhkhirakum ilā ajalin musamman).” The affirmation has a close parallel in Q 71:4,\nwhere Noah admonishes his p eople to serve God (v. 3) “so that he might forgive youp some\nof your sins and reprieve you until a specified term; when God’s term comes, it will not be\npostponed.” Thus, it is only when God’s “term” has arrived that the subsequent judgement\ncan no longer be delayed; up u ntil this moment, however, deferrals remain pos si ble. This\nis also spelled out rather clearly when the assertion that “for every term there is a written\ndecree” in Q 13:38, cited e arlier, is read together with the following verse. Q 13:39 adds that\n“God erases and sets down what he w ills; with him is the mother-s cripture” (yamḥū llāhu\nmā yashāʾu wa-y uthbitu wa-ʿ indahu ummu l-k itāb). The “mother-s cripture” is the celestial\nbook containing, among other t hings, God’s decrees for the f uture (see u nder → kitāb), and\nQ 13:39 suggests that God is at liberty to alter this mother- scripture as he sees fit. Hence,\n4 The noun matāʿ also occurs without the prepositional phrase ilā ḥīn in the same sense of “transitoriness\nand impermanence” (CDKA 251); see, e.g., Q 3:14.185 and 40:39. Elsewhere, matāʿ can mean “maintenance”\n(e.g., Q 2:240). The semantic link between the root m- t-ʿ and the noun ajal is confirmed by Q 11:3, urging the\nrecipients to seek forgiveness from God so that he “may grant you good enjoyment until a specified term” (yu-\nmattiʿkum matāʿan ḥasanan ilā ajalin musamman). That God is the one who bestows upon h umans enjoyment of\nthe world is also asserted, by means of the verb mattaʿa + acc., in vari ous other verses (e.g., Q 28:61 and 43:29).\nOn the phrases mattaʿa + acc. + ilā ḥīn, “to grant s.o. enjoyment until a certain time” (Q 10:98 and 37:148) and\ntamattaʿa + ilā ḥīn, “to enjoy o.s. until a certain time” (Q 51:43), see also under → ʿadhdhaba.\n5 Without the term ajal, the phrase wa- law-l ā kalimatun sabaqat min rabbika la-q uḍiya baynahum (“ Were\nit not for a preceding word from your Lord, a decision between them would [already] have been taken”) is also\nfound in Q 10:19, 11:110, 41:45, in addition to 42:14.\n6 Cf. also the striking statement in Q 7:187 that “the hour” of the resurrection (→ al- sāʿah) “weighs down\nthe heavens and the earth” (thaqulat fī l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍi).\najal 29", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an employs the adjective ākhir— the opposite of awwal, “first,\nancient”— both as an attribute of judgement day, which Medinan verses call al-y awm\nal- ākhir, “the final day,” and as a general label for the afterlife itself, which is frequently\ntermed al-ā khirah, “the final state of things,” or al- dār al- ākhirah, “the final abode.” This\ndual use of the descriptor ākhir implies a close conceptual grouping together of the end of\nthe world and the afterlife, making it especially fitting to speak of the Qur’anic pre sent a tion of\nGod’s universal judgement and of paradise and hell as the Qur’an’s “eschatology,” namely,\nits teaching about “final things.”1 The following will mainly focus on the terms al-y awm\nal-ā khir and al-ā khirah, while other uses of the adjective ākhir—s uch as the contrast be-\ntween al-a wwalūn and al- ākhirūn, “ancient” and “ later” generations (e.g., Q 56:13–14,\n77:16–17)2— remain largely outside the scope of the discussion. On al- nashʾah al-ā khirah/\nal- ukhrā, “the final bringing-f orth” (meaning the recreation or resurrection of h umans in\npreparation for the final judgement) in Q 29:20 and 53:47,3 see briefly u nder → khalaqa;\non al-m illah al- ākhirah, which one might render “con temporary religious teaching or\nbelief,” see under → millah.\nAl- yawm al-ā khir. Many Medinan verses refer to the “day of judgement (→ dīn1)” that\nprecedes p eople’s eternal (verb: → khalada) stay in heaven and hell (e.g., Q 2:25.39.81–82)\nas “the final day,” al- yawm al-ā khir. Most of the relevant passages identify the “final day” as\na mandatory object of belief (→ āmana), normally following directly after belief in God.\nThus, six verses evoke the one “who believes in God and the final day” (Q 2:62.126.177,\n5:69, 9:18–19: man āmana ±​<minhum> bi- llāhi wa- l- yawmi l-ā khiri), a phrase continued in\nvari ous ways, such as by reference to righ teous deeds (Q 2:62, 5:69: wa-ʿ amila → ṣāliḥan)\nor by additional objects of belief (Q 2:177). The same phrase “believing in God and in\nthe last day” is also found in a string of further verses (Q 2:8.228.232.264, 3:114, 4:38–\n39.59.136.162, 9:29.44–45.99, 24:2, 58:22, 65:2).4 “Believing in God and in the last day”\naccordingly functions as a credal condensation of the Qur’anic community’s most basic\ndoctrinal commitments. In addition, the expression al- yawm al-ā khir occurs as the object\nof the verb rajā, “to hope” or “to expect” (see also under → waʿada). Thus, in Q 29:36,\nthe only Meccan occurrence of al- yawm al- ākhir, the messenger Shuʿayb calls upon the\npeople of Madyan, “My people, serve God, expect the final day, and do not cause mischief\nand corruption on earth” (yā- qawmi ʿbudū llāha wa- rjū l- yawma l- ākhira wa- lā taʿthaw fī\nl- arḍi mufsidīn). Two more Medinan verses similarly speak of the one who, as one might\n1 My general understanding of Qur’anic eschatology is set out in HCI 162–169 and Sinai 2017a, based on\npertinent previous scholarship, especially Andrae 1926.

The Medinan employment of al- yawm al-ā khir may have something to do with the fact\nthat the early Meccan designation yawm al- dīn, “day of judgement” (e.g., Q 38:78, 51:12,\n70:26, 82:15.17–18), ceases to be used in the l ater Meccan period (→ dīn1), even if the alter-\nnative → yawm al-˻ qiyāmah, “the day of resurrection,” remains part of Medinan vocabulary\n(e.g., Q 2:85.113, 3:55.77). Al- yawm al- ākhir has a clear counterpart in New Testamental\nlanguage (John 6:39–40.44.54, 7:37, 11:24 etc.: en tē eschatē hēmera = b- yawmā ḥrāyā in\nthe Peshitta; see CQ 48),5 which in turn harks back to the notion of an “end of days” (aḥărît\nhayyāmîm/yômayyāʾ) in some passages of the Hebrew Bible (Ezek 38:16, Hos 3:5, Dan 2:28\nand 10:14; see TDOT 1:210–212 and TDNT 2:697–698). Medinan references to the “final\nday” thus make explicit that the Qur’an subscribes to a Biblically based understanding of\nearthly history as finite and moving towards a culminating end point, an “end of days,” at\nwhich God will sit in judgement over all moral agents that have previously lived. (What\nthe Qur’an lacks, however, is the conception of a millennial period of messianic peace and\njustice before the final judgement, as predicted in Rev 20:1–6.6)\nAl-ā khirah. In its feminine form, the adjective ākhir provides the standard Qur’anic\nterm for the hereafter, encompassing heaven and hell (Lange 2016a, 37–38; see also the\noverview of vari ous derivatives of ʾ- kh- r in pre- Islamic poetry in el Masri 2020, 117–131).\nAmbros maintains that al-ā khirah is short for e ither al- dār al-ā khirah, “the final abode,” or\nal-ḥ ayāh al-ā khirah, meaning the life to come (CDKA 22), but this is not entirely certain. A\nhandful of l ater Meccan and Medinan verses do indeed have al- dār al- ākhirah (Q 2:94, 6:32,\n7:169, 28:77.83, 29:64, 33:29), or its variant dār al-ā khirah (Q 12:109, 16:30; see Ṭab. 1:251).\nYet given that the expression al-ā khirah is fully established already in the early Meccan\nperiod (Q 53:25, 68:33, 74:53, 75:21, 79:25, 87:17, 92:13, 93:4), well before the appearance\nof al- dār al- ākhirah, it is not obvious that one is entitled to interpret al-ā khirah as a trun-\ncation of al- dār al-ā khirah.7 As for the possibility that al-ā khirah abbreviates al-ḥ ayāh al-\nākhirah, this latter expression is not explic itly attested in the Qur’an. It is true that several\npassages, starting with the early Meccan couplet Q 87:16–17, employ al-ā khirah in close\nproximity to → al-ḥ ayāh al- ˻dunyā, “the proximate life,” and this naturally suggests that\nal-ā khirah, too, presupposes the noun ḥayāh, “life” (see also, for instance, Q 2:86, 4:74,\nor 9:38). Still, the fact that there are no Qur’anic instances in which ākhirah is explic itly\nused as a modifying adjective of ḥayāh, even where one might have expected the text to\nexploit the opportunity for a parallelistic pairing of al- ḥayāh al-d unyā and al- ḥayāh al-\nākhirah (see Q 10:64, 14:3.27, 16:107, 41:31), gives pause; the Islamic scripture consistently\nprefers coupling al-ḥ ayāh al- dunyā with simple al-ā khirah. In view of this, it is uncertain\nthat al-ā khirah is abbreviatory. Translators wanting to capture the term’s antonomastic\nallusiveness may want to have recourse to makeshift renderings like “what is final” or “the\nfinal state of things.” Many existing En glish translations of the Qur’an, of course, opt for\n“the hereafter.” While this has the advantage of employing an established En glish expres-\nsion that yields at least a reasonable semantic fit, it has the drawback of capturing neither\n5 Other verses speak of “final days” in the plural, like Acts 2:17, 2 Tim 3:1, Jas 5:3, or 2 Pet 3:3.\n6 I owe this observation to Saqib Hussain.\n7 By contrast, it is more justifiable to consider the expression → al-d unyā to function as an ellipsis for\nal-ḥ ayāh al- dunyā, considering that the latter is the form that is exclusively found in the early Meccan period\n(Q 53:29, 79:38, 87:16).\n32 ākhir", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As the Qur’an reminds its addressees, the “final state of t hings” or the “final abode” is\nnot only “better than” the “proximate” life (e.g., Q 4:77, 6:32, 12:109; see also 93:4), which is\nsaid to be “fleeting” or “transient” (Q 17:18, 75:20, 76:27: al-ʿ ājilah), but is “the abode of sta-\nbility” (Q 40:39: dār al- qarār; see also Q 14:29 and 38:60 as well as Lange 2016a, 38).8 The\nfinal state of t hings is also irreversible, a fact dramatically depicted in a number of passages\nin which the evildoers, confronted with their impending punishment, vainly implore God\nto be permitted to return to their earthly existence so that they might do better (Q 6:27,\n7:53, 23:99–100.107, 32:12, 35:37).

The temporal sequentiality that is inherent in the notion of a\n“final state of t hings” may appear disrupted by occasional affirmations presupposing the\npossibility of immediate entry into paradise (→ jannah) even before the day of judgement\n(Q 2:154, 3:169, 36:26–28), which suggest that the Qur’an considers paradise to be in some\nsense contemporaneous with, rather than merely subsequent to, the pre sent world (Lange\n2016a, 39–43). But t here is no genuine paradox h ere if one understands the term al-ā khirah\nto be relative to individuals: at least in some circumstances, one person may already have\nentered his or her ākhirah while others are still living their “proximate life.”\nCorrelates of al- ākhirah. In several early Meccan verses (Q 53:25, 79:25, 92:13, and\n93:4) and again in the later Meccan verse Q 28:70, al-ā khirah is paired with al-ū lā, “what\nis first,” namely, pre sent, pre- eschatological existence. Q 75:20–21, also early Meccan, and\nagain Q 17:18–19 oppose al-ā khirah to al-ʿ ājilah, “what is fleeting” or “what passes in haste.”\nAcross the Qur’an as a w hole, however, the standard antonym of al-ā khirah is → al- dunyā\nor al-ḥ ayāh al-d unyā, “the proximate life.” The latter expression appears as a correlate of\nal-ā khirah in an early Meccan passage (Q 87:16–17) and then comes to be frequent in later\nMeccan and Medinan passages (for al-d unyā and al- ākhirah, see, e.g., Q 2:114.130 etc.,\n3:22.45.56; for al-ḥ ayāh al-d unyā and al-ā khirah, see, e.g., 2:86, 4:74, 13:26.34, 14:3.27).\nWhile al-ū lā and al-ʿ ājilah are both terms that connote temporal succession or change,\nthe same is not true for al-ḥ ayāh al- dunyā: the attribute → dunyā, the feminine of adnā\n(“nearer, nearest”), is spatial rather than temporal (Lange 2016a, 37), casting the pre sent,\npre- eschatological sphere of existence as “proximate.” Al- dunyā in the approximate sense\nof “this world” is attested in pre- Islamic poetry (for references, see under → dunyā), but\ndoes not seem to imply al- ākhirah as its counterpart there. The early Meccan fluidity\nin the vari ous correlates of al- ākhirah (al- ūlā, al- ʿājilah, al- ḥayāh al-d unyā) is certainly\nstriking and is best explained by assuming that the established dunyā- ākhirah dichotomy\nof the later Meccan and the Medinan proclamations is the outcome of a gradual pro cess\nof phraseological consolidation over the course of the Meccan period rather than having\ncrystallised already in pre- Qur’anic Arabic.\n8 On the non-p erpetuity of the currently existing cosmos as opposed to God’s eschatological second cre-\nation, see also → ajal.\nākhir 33", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Nonetheless, the expression al-ā khirah as such may have had some currency in pre-\nQur’anic Arabic: as noted, the expression has a significant number of occurrences in the\nearly Meccan surahs (Q 53:25, 68:33, 74:53, 75:21, 79:25, 87:17, 92:13, 93:4), and in contrast\nwith its shifting correlates does not really compete with any other terms in designating the\nafterlife.9 In other words, al-ā khirah may already have been a reasonably well- established\nArabic expression in the milieu of the earliest Qur’anic proclamations, even if it was not\nyet habitually paired with al- dunyā. It is tempting to speculate that al-ā khirah might have\nserved Arabic- speaking Christians as a plausible equivalent of Syriac ḥartā, “the end” or\n“the eschaton” (e.g., Bedjan 1905–1910, 1:510, l. 7). In its Qur’anic use, of course, al-ā khirah\nrefers to the hereafter—i .e., to people’s eternal residence in heaven or hell— rather than to\nthe convulsive disintegration of the pre sent world on the day of judgement. This semantic\nshift could be original to the Qur’an. Yet it is also conceivable that already pre- Qur’anic\nspeakers of Arabic w ere wont to oppose al-ā khirah with al-ū lā, since this contrast is a fter all\nfound in four early Meccan verses (see above) and thus has a better claim to reflecting pre-\nQur’anic usage than the ākhirah-d unyā dichotomy that ultimately emerged as the Qur’anic\nstandard. If it is the case that not only the expression al-ā khirah but also its opposition to\nal-ū lā were in use before the Qur’an, then this would entail that al-ā khirah had already\ncome to refer to the hereafter prior to Muhammad’s preaching. The range of possibilities\nis impossible to narrow down without pre- Qur’anic Arabic prooftexts.\nFunctionally, the Qur’anic polarity of al- dunyā and al-ā khirah is of course akin to the\nNew Testamental contrast between “this age” and “the coming age” (Matt 12:32: oute en\ntoutō tō aiōni oute en tō mellonti; Peshitta: ʿālmā hānā vs ʿālmā da-ʿ tīd; see also Mark 10:30\nand Luke 18:30: en tō aiōni tō erchomenō = b-ʿ ālmā d-ā tē, and Heb 2:5 and 6:5) and to the\ncognate juxtaposition of “this world” and “the coming world” (ha- ʿolam ha-b aʾ, ʿalma\nd- ate; DTTM 1052, 1084–1085; DJBA 867–868) in rabbinic language. It seems clear that\nthis is the contrast that the opposition of al-ā khirah with al- dunyā or al-ū lā is intended to\nexpress in Arabic. The match is only partial, however: the New Testamental and rabbinic\nopposition comprises two terms that are explic itly temporal, and it qualifies one and the\nsame noun (aiōn, ʿolam, ʿalma) by two contrasting adjectives.10 By contrast, the Qur’an,\nas we saw, opposes a spatial term (dunyā) to a temporal one (ākhirah), without a recur-\nrent noun underpinning both ele ments of the antithesis. Designating the pre sent and the\neschatological age as “worlds” was not unknown in pre-I slamic Arabia, as indicated by a\nSouth Arabian inscription (b-ʿ lmn bʿdn w- qrbn, “in the far and the near world”; Mordt-\nmann and Müller 1896, 287 and 289–290; CIH, no. 539, l. 2). It is noteworthy, therefore,\nthat the Qur’an never employs ʿālam in the sense of New Testamental aiōn: the Qur’anic\nplural → al- ʿālamūn (always used in the genitive) means “the world- dwellers,” not “the\nworlds.”11 Instead, the Islamic scripture came to articulate the contrast between a pre sent\n9 This is to ignore infrequent circumlocutions like “To yourS Lord is the final end” (Q 53:42: wa- anna ilā\nrabbika l- muntahā), which do not seem to make use of established technical terminology.\n10 But note that Greek eschatos can also be used in a spatial sense: Acts 1:8 and 13:47.\n11 Of par tic u lar interest in this regard are Q 2:102.200 and 3:77, uttering the threat that vari ous kinds of\npeople have “no portion in the hereafter” (lā khalāqa lahum fī l-ā khirati). While this is likely to echo Mishnaic\ndeclarations that certain categories of persons have no “share in the world to come” (→ khalāq), the three verses\nat hand replace the rabbinic term “the world to come” with the Qur’anic al-ā khirah rather than employing Arabic\nʿālam. Thus, even in a phraseological context in which a use of ʿālam in the sense of Greek aiōn or Hebrew ʿolam\nwould have been expected, this does not materialise.\n34 ākhir", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The predication is a resonance of two passages\nfrom the Biblical book of Isaiah (44:6 and 48:12; see BEQ 445). To call God “the first” could\nunderscore that he temporally precedes the world created by him, though Fakhr al- Dīn\nal- Rāzī cautions that the priority in question does not necessarily have to be understood\nin a temporal sense (İskenderoğlu 2002, 71; Fakhr al- Dīn al-R āzī 1981, 29:210–212). In fact,\nother Qur’anic verses give the impression that the creation of the cosmos proceeded from\na pre- existing substrate (Q 21:30), and the Islamic scripture does not generally espouse the\ndoctrine of creation ex nihilo in an unequivocal manner (see u nder → khalaqa). A pos si-\nble, mildly Aristotelianising solution would be to propose that God’s firstness as asserted\nin Q 57:3 is compatible with the existence of unformed matter in so far as the latter, being\ndevoid of all shape, does not yet qualify as a discrete and proper existent. As for God’s\ndescription as “the last,” contrary to the early theologian Jahm ibn Ṣafwān (Lange 2016a,\n168–171), this probably does not signal that at some future time solely God will remain in\nexistence, since the Qur’an frequently and explic itly envisages paradise and hell as being\neternal (→ khalada). More likely, the under lying rationale of calling God “the last” is that\nhe, unlike other things, w ill never perish (Q 28:88, 55:26–27), whereas the inhabitants of\nparadise and hell, even though they will persist into the indefinite future, will have been\nresurrected from the dead, i.e., w ill have been “rec reated” (e.g., Q 10:4.34, 27:64, 30:11.27:\nyabdaʾu l- khalqa thumma yuʿīduhu; → khalaqa).

In Qur’anic Arabic, al-a rḍ normally means “the earth,” sometimes in the spe-\ncific sense of the soil or the ground (Q 2:71, 5:31, 30:9). Frequently, al- arḍ occurs as part\nof the merism al-s amāwāt wa-l -a rḍ, “the heavens and the earth,” which is discussed in\ndetail in what follows. In contrast to the seven heavens, which the Qur’an mentions re-\npeatedly (e.g., Q 2:29, 67:3, 71:15; → samāʾ), the Islamic scripture normally speaks of the\nearth in the singular, even though Q 65:12 seems to imply that God created as many layers\nof earth as heavens (Tabataba’i and Mirsadri 2016, 211). Depending on its context of use,\nthe word arḍ can also refer to a par tic u lar portion or region of the earth, in which sense\nit is usually translated as “land.” Arabic arḍ shares this ambiguity with Hebrew ereṣ and\nAramaic arʿā (TDOT 1:393–405; DJBA 170–171; SL 104). The pre sent entry will begin\nby examining the first, universal sense of the word, then outline some of the principal\naspects of the Qur’anic portrayal of the earth, and fi nally consider how to navigate the\nword’s earth- land ambiguity.\n“The heavens and the earth” (al- samāwāt wa- l- arḍ). While Greek and, in its wake,\nSyriac have well- established terms for the totality of creation (namely, ho kosmos, corre-\nsponding to Syriac ʿālmā), the same is not true for Qur’anic Arabic (see also Tabataba’i\nand Mirsadri 2016, 206–207). The Arabic word ʿālam, perhaps the closest counterpart to\nGreek kosmos, is in the Qur’an only attested in the plural → al-ʿ ālamūn, which is not used\nto mean “worlds” but rather “world- dwellers.” Another potential equivalent of ho kosmos\nthat may spring to mind is → al- dunyā, often translated as “this world.” Yet in the Qur’an\nal- dunyā in fact functions as a concise variant of al-ḥ ayāh al-d unyā, “the proximate life,”\nand accordingly designates not the cosmos or universe but rather the pre- eschatological\ndimension of h uman existence, in opposition to → al-ā khirah or al- dār al-ā khirah, “the\nfinal abode.” Overall, the closest approximation to a comprehensive designation of the\ncreated order in the Qur’an is the merism “the heavens and the earth” (al- samāwāt wa- l-\narḍ), which palpably parallels the Hebrew Bible’s pairing of haššāmayim and hāʾāreṣ (e.g.,\nGen 1:1, 2:1.4, 14:19.22, Ps 115:15; Peshitta: shmayyā + arʿā; see more generally TDOT 15:210\n36 arḍ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As pointed out above, in\nthe context of Qur’anic cosmology the plural samāwāt accords with the fact that a number\nof Qur’anic passages speak of seven heavens in par tic ul ar (e.g., Q 67:3, 71:15; → samāʾ).\nA prominent thematic context in which the expression al-s amāwāt wa-l -a rḍ occurs\nare hymnic statements underscoring the universal reach of God’s authority. First, Meccan\nsurahs designate God as the “Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between them”\n(rabb al- samāwāt wa- l- arḍ wa- mā baynahumā; Q 19:65, 26:24, 37:5, 38:66, 44:7, 78:37; cf.\nalso 23:86: rabb al- samāwāt al- sabʿ). Other passages have the bipartite variant “Lord of the\nheavens and the earth” (Q 13:16, 17:102, 18:14, 21:56, 43:82; cf. 45:36; see also u nder → rabb).2\nIn terms of inner- Qur’anic chronology, the bipartite version comes into view l ater than the\ntripartite one.3 Yet the shorter version is in fact the more ancient one: it goes back to Biblical\nlit er a ture (Gen 24:3: YHWH ĕlōhê haššāmayim wēʾlōhē hāʾāreṣ, Peshitta: māryā allāhā da-\nshmayyā w- allāhā d- arʿā; Matt 11:25 and Luke 10:21: kyrie tou ouranou kai tēs gēs, Peshitta:\nmārā da- shmayyā w- d- arʿā) and, as just noted, also figures in Jewish (or Judaising) and\nChristian inscriptions in Epigraphic South Arabian. A second formulation for God’s cosmic\nsupremacy is found in l ater Meccan and Medinan passages crediting God with “kingship”\n(→ mulk) over the heavens and the earth (or over the heavens and the earth “and what is\nbetween them”; e.g., Q 2:107, 3:189, 5:17.18.40.120, 7:158, 9:116, 25:2, 39:44, 85:9).4 Thirdly,\nand roughly during the same chronological period as the passages just enumerated, the\nQur’an declares that God owns “every thing (or every one) in the heavens and on earth” (li-\nllāhi/lahu mā/man fī l-s amāwāti wa-l -a rḍi / wa-m ā fī l-a rḍi; e.g., Q 2:116.255.284, 3:109.129,\n4:126.131.132.170.171, 10:55.66.68, 14:2, 20:6, 21:19, 30:26).5\nThe heavens and the earth are furthermore paired in affirmations of God’s omniscience:\nto God belongs “what is hidden (→ al- ghayb) in the heavens and on earth” (e.g., Q 2:33,\n11:23, 16:77, 18:26, or 35:38), and he “knows every thing (or every one) in the heavens and\non earth” (e.g., Q 3:29, 5:97, 17:55, 34:3; see also 3:5, 10:18, 14:38, or 34:2.3). In other verses,\n“the heavens and the earth” (or “the heavens and the earth and what is between them”)\n1 Cf. in par tic u lar the formulaic declaration that to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth\n(Q 2:116.255, 4:171, 10:68, 14:2, 16:52, 20:6, 21:19, 22:64, 30:26, 34:1, 42:4.53, 59:24: lahu mā/man fī l- samāwāti\nwa- mā fī l- arḍi) and 1 Chr 29:11 (BEQ 311).\n2 Cf. also Q 43:84 (wa- huwa lladhī fī l- samāʾi ilāhun wa- fī l- arḍi ilāhun).\n3 The surah with the highest mean verse length containing the tripartite title is Q 19 (62.42 transliteration\nletters per verse), while the surah with the lowest mean verse length containing the bipartite title is Q 43 (61.78\ntransliteration letters). This indicates a development from the former t owards the latter, perhaps via a brief period\nof overlap. Nonetheless, the tail wa- mā baynahumā does recur in several surahs with a higher mean verse length\n(though not as part of a genitive construction beginning with rabb): Q 5:17.18, 21:16, 25:59, 30:8, 32:4, 46:33. On\n“the heavens and the earth and what is between them,” see also O’Shaughnessy 1973, 212–213.\n4 With regard to Q 85:9, it should be noted that while Surah 85 is early Meccan, v. 9 belongs to a section that\nhas been identified as consisting of later insertions (Neuwirth 2007, 224; PP 332–333, 336).\n5 It is int ere st ing to observe that Q 20:6, prob ably the earliest occurrence of the formula, has the more exten-\nsive “to him belongs what is in the heavens and the earth and what is between them and what is under ground.” The\nmean verse length of Surah 20 is 61.04 transliteration letters per verse, putting it at the same boundary, in terms\nof mean verse length, that witnesses the switch from the tripartite rabb al- samāwāt wa- l- arḍ wa- mā baynahumā\nto the bipartite rabb al- samāwāt wa- l- arḍ. God’s owner ship over the heavens and the earth is also conveyed by\nsaying that “he holds the keys (maqālīd) to the heavens and the earth” (Q 39:63, 42:12).\narḍ 37", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

God’s creation of the\nheavens and the earth is repeatedly said to have been accomplished “in six days,” in line\nwith Gen 1 (Q 7:54, 10:3, 11:7, 25:59, 32:4, 50:38, 57:4: khalaqa/khalaqnā l- samāwāti wa-\nl- arḍa ±​<wa-m ā baynahumā> fī sittati ayyāmin).6 After the primordial creation of heaven\nand earth, God continues to “hold back the heaven so that it does not fall down upon the\nearth, except by his permission (idhn)” (Q 22:65: wa-y umsiku l-s amāʾa an taqaʿa ʿalā\nl-a rḍi illā bi- idhnihi; cf. similarly 35:41; see also 30:25).7 In this sense, the created cosmos\ncontinues to depend on being divinely sustained, a notion that aligns with other Qur’anic\nstatements presenting divine creation as a continuous real ity rather than as a one- of act\nin the distant past (→ khalaqa).\nDespite the Qur’an’s acute awareness of human unbelief in and repudiation of God,\nseveral verses stress that “every thing [or, according to a variant, every one] in the heavens\nand on earth” is in some sense engaged in praising the creator (Q 24:41, 57:1, 59:1.24,\n61:1, 62:1, 64:1: sabbaḥa/yusabbiḥu li-l lāhi/lahu man/mā fī l- samāwāti wa- mā fī l- arḍi /\nwa- l- arḍi; see also 17:44; on sabbaḥa, see under → ḥamd). Similar affirmations employ\nthe verb → sajada, “to prostrate o.s.”: “every one in the heavens and on earth prostrates\nhimself/herself to God, willingly or [literally: and] by force” (Q 13:15: li- llāhi yasjudu man\nfī l-s amāwāti wa-l -a rḍi ṭawʿan wa-k arhan; see also 16:49 and 22:18), and Q 3:83 under-\nscores that “every one in the heavens and on earth surrender themselves (→ aslama) to\nhim,” again with the ominous rider “willingly or [and] by force.” Such language should be\ntaken meta phor ically, in the sense that non- rational entities and creatures “praise” God\nby bearing witness to his power and wisdom and “prostrate themselves” to him by being\nsubject to his sway (see in more detail under → sajada). This interpretation is supported\nby comparative evidence: Ps 19:2 declares that “the heavens are telling the glory of God;\nand the firmament proclaims his handi work,” while Jacob of Sarug says that “every thing\nin its place raises up glory (teshbūḥtā) to the Creator” (Mathews 2020, 18–19, l. 1932; cf.\nMathews 2020, 28–29, l. 2016).8 As regards h uman individuals who refuse to acknowledge\nGod, they presumably come u nder the rubric of prostration or self-s urrender “by force”\n(karhan), in so far as they will be brought to heel on judgement day at the latest.\nAnthropocentric portrayal of the earth. As pointed out by Averroes, it is a character-\nistic feature of the Qur’an to render plausible the existence of an omnipotent and munificent\ncreator by “drawing attention to the providence shown to humans (al-ʿ ināyah bi- l- insān)\nand to the fact that every thing that exists has been created for their sake” (Ibn Rushd\n1964, 150 = Najjar 2001, 33). Thus, Q 45:13 declares that God “has made every thing in the\nheavens and on earth subservient to youp” (sakhkhara lakum mā fī l-s amāwāti wa-m ā\nfī l-a rḍi jamīʿan; similarly 31:20; for the first part of the statement, see also 22:65). The\nformulation sakhkhara lakum (“he has made subservient to youp . . .”) recurs with other\n6 However, Surah 41 reports that the creation of the earth took two days (v. 9), then allocates four days\nto God’s furnishing the earth with mountains and vario us kinds of “sustenance” (v. 10), and then proceeds to\nallot (another?) two days to the creation of the seven heavens (v. 12). On w hether and how this passage may be\nharmonised with the statements quoted in the main text, see BEQ 8–9 and KK 433.\n7 For more on God’s permission (idhn), see under → shāʾa.\n8 Cf. also Mathews 2018, 32–37, ll. 1403–1436, elaborating upon Ps 19:2.

A variant formulation of the same\nidea is found in Q 36:71–73 and 67:15, which remind the hearers that God has subjected\n(dhallala, jaʿala dhalūlan) to them livestock (al- anʿām) and the earth as a w hole (see also\nthe further discussion of Q 67:15 below). It is worth noting the contrast to Gen 1:28: t here,\nGod commands Adam and Eve to “subdue” the earth, whereas in Q 36:72 and 67:15 the\nagent of subjugation is God himself (HCI 172).10 Hence, the Qur’an more pointedly casts\nhumans as recipients of divine favour and solicitude rather than merely as empowered\nto carve out a livelihood for themselves. On the whole, however, Qur’anic cosmology\nresonates quite closely with the Biblical tradition, which likewise envisages the earth\nas a habitat that is custom- made for humans: “The heavens are the Lord’s heavens, but\nthe earth he has given to human beings” (Ps 115:16, pointed out in NIDOTTE 1:519).11 By\ncontrast, the Qur’anic portrayal of nature is appreciably at odds with pre- Islamic poetry,\nwhich often depicts h umans’ natur al environment as desolate, inhospitable, and threaten-\ning (Neuwirth 2002, 300–303; see also HCI 172–173). It is quite striking, in fact, that the\nQur’an by and large omits references to the many destructive aspects of nature that would\nsurely have been a feature of the Qur’anic addressees’ experience of the world; explicit\nreferences to natur al disasters, for instance, tend to figure only in narrative contexts, where\nthey can be cast as acts of divine retribution (e.g., the Egyptian plagues at Q 7:130–133;\nsee more generally Heemskerk 2006). The Qur’anic stance t owards the natur al world is\nthus unqualifiedly affirmative and articulates a profound sense of humans being at home\nin the world (see also under → afsada).\nThe anthropocentrism of Qur’anic cosmology is not unbridled. One verse, Q 55:10,\ndeclares that God has established the earth for all animate beings (wa- l- arḍa waḍaʿahā li- l-\nanām) rather than just for h umans,12 and Q 16:68–69 details how God has arranged shelter\n9 For other instances of sakhkara li-, see Q 38:36 (God makes the wind subservient to Solomon) and the\nfirst- person blessing cited in Q 43:13, after a reference to “ships and beasts that you ride” (v. 12: wa- jaʿala lakum\nmina l- fulki wa- l- anʿāmi mā tarkabūn): “Praise be him who has made this subservient to us” (wa- taqūlū subḥāna\nlladhī sakhkhara lanā hādhā). For occurrences of sakhkhara that are not followed by lakum but in which the latter\nis arguably implied, see Q 13:2, 29:61, 31:29, 35:13, and 39:5 (wa- sakhkhara l- shamsa wa- l- qamara, “he made the\nsun and the moon subservient”), 16:14 (the object being the sea, “so that you may eat fresh fish from it and extract\nfrom it ornaments to wear”). Q 21:79 (wa- sakhkharnā maʿa dāwūda l- jibāla yusabbiḥna wa- l-ṭ ayra) and 38:18–19\n(innā sakhkharnā l- jibāla maʿahu yusabbiḥna . . . / / wa- l-ṭ ayra . . .) would seem to employ maʿa in lieu of li-. As\nSaqib Hussain points out to me, this switch is likely due to the presence, in both cases, of the verb yusabbiḥna\n(“they glorify”), predicated of the mountains and the birds: they are made subservient to David and praise God\ntogether with him. In one case, sakhkhara is employed with subsequent ʿalā, “to harness s.th. [namely, a violent\nwind] against s.o.” (Q 69:6–7). See also the treatment in CDKA 130–131, who additionally notes vario us instances\nof the passive participle musakhkhar. For a recent discussion of the Qur’anic notion of taskhīr, see Tlili 2012,\n92–115, who is concerned to show that the notion does not imply animals to be inherently inferior to h umans.\n10 Q 36:71–73 and related verses are discussed in Tlili 2012, 75–91.\n11 Cf. also Jacob of Sarug’s description of the world as a house, palace, or city to be inhabited by Adam\n(Mathews 2020, 44–47, ll. 2135–2156). Note that notwithstanding the Qur’an’s prevalent depiction of the earth\nas the habitat of humans, it is, like heaven, occasionally personified (Q 11:44, 41:11, 44:29, 99:1–5).\n12 Some exegetical traditions suggest that al- anām means (i) animals or specifically land animals (namely,\n“every thing endowed with spirit,” kull shayʾ fīhi l- rūḥ, or “every thing that moves on the ground,” kull shayʾ dabba\naw daraja), while others maintain that the word signifies (ii) h umans and the jinn (whom one might group\narḍ 39", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Indeed, it is stated explic itly that God’s provision (rizq; see\nunder → razaqa) is not only bestowed upon humans but upon all other land animals as well\n(Q 11:6: wa- mā min dābbatin fī l- arḍi illā ʿalā llāhi rizquhā; see also 29:60): though the latter\nmay have been put at mankind’s ser vice, this does not deprive them of a legitimate claim\nto have their vital needs met.13 Moreover, the Qur’an’s insistence that h umans are prone to\ninflict corruption (afsada) on the earth after God has put it in good order (Q 7:56.85; see\nfurther under → afsada) suggests that the way in which h umans interact with their divinely\ngifted habitat, including perhaps the way in which they treat other animate beings in it, is\nsubject to moral evaluation. Nonetheless, the Qur’an’s paramount stress remains on the\nfact that the earth is replete with phenomena that “benefit h umans” (Q 2:164, 13:17: mā\nyanfaʿu l- nāsa; other verses highlighting the utility of natu ral phenomena, employing the\nroot n- f-ʿ , are 2:219, 16:5, 23:21, 36:73, 40:80, and 57:25; see also under → nafaʿa). Tellingly,\neven the statement about bees just referenced finishes by underscoring their utility to\nhumans: they produce honey, which has healing qualities (Q 16:69).\nGod’s optimisation of the earth for human residence encompasses two foremost as-\npects in par tic u lar, which are summarily intimated in Q 67:15’s reminder that God “has\nmade the earth subject to youp, so walk on its shoulders and eat of his provision” (huwa\nlladhī jaʿala lakumu l-a rḍa dhalūlan fa- mshū fī manākibihā wa- kulū min rizqihi). First, the\ninvitation to “walk on” the earth’s “shoulders”— which fits the verse’s implicit portrayal\nof the earth as a domesticated animal14— draws attention to the fact that the surface of\nthe earth is topographically suitable to being traversed, facilitating h uman mobility and\ntransportation. Thus, God has “spread the earth out for youp” (Q 20:53, 43:10: jaʿala la-\nkumu l- arḍa mahdan; see also 51:48 and 78:6),15 an idea that is also expressed by means\nof other consonantal roots (Q 2:22 and 51:48: f- r- sh; 71:19: b- s-ṭ ; 13:3, 15:19, 50:7: m- d- d;\n79:30: d-ḥ - w; 88:20: s-ṭ -ḥ ; 91:6: ṭ-ḥ - w).16 It is pertinent that God’s spreading out of the earth\nalso figures in an Arabic poem about the creation of the world attributed to ʿAdī ibn Zayd\n(al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 103:5: wa- basaṭa l- arḍa basṭan). This does not, incidentally, justify\nconsidering the poem to be dependent on the Qur’an, since the motif can be traced back to\ntogether as rational agents). See Ṭab. 22:179–281 and al- Thaʿlabī 2015, 25:298, and the discussion in Tlili 2012,\n111–112. Both options can be viewed as implicitly resting on contextual observations. Option (ii) would seem to\nbe grounded in the fact that Q 55:14–15 mentions God’s creation of h umans and jinn. Option (i), meanwhile,\nmay be supported by pointing out that vv. 11–12 list several types of plants (fruit, palm- trees, grain, herbs), sug-\ngesting that the anām from v. 10 refer to t hose creatures who are, directly or indirectly, supported by the earth’s\nvegetation— that is, to animals. Neuwirth (PP 589) translates al- anām as “ human beings,” but does not provide\na justification. In fact, if Q 55:10 is juxtaposed with Ps 104:14 (“who c auses the grass to grow for the animals, and\nplants for p eople’s l abour, to bring forth food from the earth”), as proposed by her (PP 597), this lends plausibility\nto the view that al- anām as used in Q 55:10 encompasses both non-h uman animals and h umans rather than just\nthe latter. On balance, the point of Q 55:10 is therefore that God has established the earth, with the sundry kinds\nof vegetation sprouting on it (vv. 11–12), in order to provide sustenance to the earth’s fauna. This does not as such\ncontradict other Qur’anic passages asserting that some of the earth’s fauna (i.e., non- human animals) are put at\nthe ser vice of others (i.e., humans).\n13 On dābbah, see CDKA 95. For a digest of some exegetical voices on Q 11:6 and 29:60, see Tlili 2012, 147–149.\n14 That the word dhalūl can refer to a tamed animal is clear from Q 2:71 (cf. also 36:72, with the cognate verb\ndhallala). I owe my awareness of the link between dhalūl and manākib to Saqib Hussain.\n15 Note also Q 13:18, where it is hell that is sardonically called a mihād, a “resting- place spread out.”\n16 Q 13:3, 15:19, 50:7 o ught to be contrasted with 84:3 (wa- idhā l- arḍu muddat), where madda serves to de-\nscribe the eschatological flattening of the earth. The use of the passive here— a Qur’anic version of what Biblical\nscholars call the passivum divinum—is in line with other eschatological passages (HCI 173).\n40 arḍ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In addition, God has also provided for the possibility of shipborne transport by\nmeans of rivers (anhār; Q 13:3, 14:32, 16:15, 27:61, 71:12) and the sea (al- baḥr; see Q 2:164,\n14:32, 16:14, 17:66.70, 22:65, 31:31, 35:12, 42:32, 45:12; see also 55:24).18 God is thus “the one\nwho enables youp to travel by land and sea” (Q 10:22: huwa lladhī yusayyirukum fī l- barri\nwa- l- baḥri; see also 17:70: wa-ḥ amalnāhum fī l- barri wa- l- baḥri; → sāra).19\nRelated to the earth’s traversability is its stability. The existence of “firmly implanted”\nmountains (rawāsī), which evidently impede human movement, is explained by their\nfunction of preventing the earth from “making youp sway” (Q 16:15, 21:31, 31:10: an tamīda\nbikum; see also 13:3, 15:19, 27:61, 41:10; see also Tabataba’i and Mirsadri 2016, 211–212). The\nimmobility of the earth—w hich contrasts with the mobility of its h uman occupants—is fur-\nther highlighted by verses describing it as a “stable abode” (qarār, mustaqarr) for h umans\nand other land animals (Q 2:36, 7:24, 11:6, 27:61, 40:64; on qarār, see also 14:26).20 Yet\nthe earth’s God- given stability must not be taken for granted (Q 67:16), and it w ill in fact\ncease to be firm and immobile when the end of the world arrives (Q 56:4, 69:14, 73:14,\n89:21, 99:1). Once again, the frequency, in many of the above passages as well as others, of\npronouns with a possessive suffix in the second person plural (lakum, bikum) is noteworthy\nand indicates the extent to which the Qur’an envisages nature and the basic structure of\nthe cosmos in terms of human interests and needs.21\nThe second principal aspect of God’s optimisation of the earth for human habitation,\nas condensed in Q 67:15, comes in the form of the invitation to “eat” of God’s “provision”\n(kulū min rizqihi): the earth is furnished with vegetation and fauna that is suitable for\nhuman consumption. That God endows humans with generous provision is frequently\nreiterated throughout the Qur’an (→ razaqa), both in general terms and by means of\nspecific examples. The sea, for instance, is not only invoked as afording opportunities\nfor transport but also as having been supplied by God “so that youp may eat fresh fish\n(laḥman ṭariyyan) from it and extract from it ornaments to wear” (Q 16:14; see also\n35:12 and 5:96). By sending down rain, God causes the earth to bring forth vegetation\n(Q 10:24, 18:45, 20:53, 22:5, 26:7, 27:60, 31:10; see also 2:61, 15:19, 26:7, 36:36, 50:7, 71:17,\n80:26–27) and “revives” it “ after it has died” (Q 2:164, 16:65, 29:63, 30:19.24.50, 35:9,\n45:5, 57:17: aḥyā/aḥyaynā/yuḥyī ±​<bihi> l-a rḍa baʿda mawtihā / min baʿdi mawtihā; see\n17 As Dmitriev notes, the Qur’an does not employ the verb basaṭa (Dmitriev 2010, 358). Q 71:19 arguably\nparaphrases it (jaʿala lakumu l- arḍa bisāṭā), but as the references in the main text show derivatives of other roots\nsuch as f- r- sh, m- d-d , and m- h- d are more common in this context.\n18 On the availability of ships (al- fulk) as a divine grace, sometimes mentioned in parallel with beasts of\nburden, see also Q 10:22, 23:22, 29:65, 30:46, 40:80, 43:12.\n19 Other expressions that are indicative of the Qur’an’s emphasis on h uman travel are ḍaraba fī l- arḍ (e.g.,\nQ 2:273, 3:156), sāḥa fī l- arḍ (Q 9:2), and → sāra fī l- arḍ.\n20 For a dif er ent use of qarār, see, e.g., Q 40:39: the true “abode of stability” (dār al- qarār) is the hereafter.\n21 Apart from the phrase sakhkhara lakum, discussed above, see also jaʿala lakum, “he has made for youp . . .”\n(e.g., Q 2:22, 6:97, 10:67, 16:81, 20:53, 25:47, 28:73, 40:61.64.79), khalaqa lakum, “he has created for youp . . .”\n(Q 2:29, 16:5, 26:166, 30:21), anzala (or yunazzilu) lakum, “he sends down for youp . . .” (e.g., rain or “provision”;\nQ 10:59, 27:60, 39:6, 40:13), salaka lakum, “he has paved for youp . . .” (namely, pathways; Q 20:53), yunbitu\nlakum, “he causes to grow for youp . . .” (Q 16:11), and yuzjī lakum, “he propels forward for youp . . .” (namely,\nboats in the sea; Q 17:66).\narḍ 41", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The earth’s God- given fertility is sometimes described in\nconsiderable detail (e.g., Q 13:4). As we saw above, the earth’s vegetation also sustains\nanimals; yet the ultimate beneficiaries of the food chains thus established are the earth’s\nhuman incumbents.\nThe ultimate purpose of God’s creation of the earth, however, is not to gratify h umans,\nas if that were an end in itself, but rather “to test youp, [in order to ascertain] which one\nof you does better deeds” (Q 11:7: li- yabluwakum ayyukum aḥsanu ʿamalan; similar state-\nments using the verb → balā are found in 18:7, 67:2, and 76:2; see also O’Shaughnessy\n1985, 60–61, who additionally draws attention to Q 10:4). The earth thus functions as\nthe arena in which humans are to prove their moral merit, in preparation for God’s final\njudgement. The fact that humans have been embedded in a supremely hospitable habitat\nthus comes with a corresponding set of moral and religious responsibilities towards God\nand other humans, grounded in the duty to be grateful (verb: shakara) to the creator:\n“We have established youp on the earth and provided you with livelihoods there; yet you\nare scarcely grateful” (wa-la qad makkannākum fī l-a rḍi wa-j aʿalnā lakum fīhā maʿāyisha\nqalīlan mā tashkurūn), the divine voice reproaches the Qur’an’s recipients in Q 7:10\n(→ makkana, with further references). The assertion that God “created the jinn and\nhumans only so that they might serve” him (Q 51:56: wa-m ā khalaqtu l-j inna wa-l -i nsa\nillā li-y aʿbudūn; see O’Shaughnessy 1985, 58–59, with further references) may be under-\nstood as a variation on the same theme. In response to his creative munificence, moral\nagents owe God certain religious- ethical responses, variously described as gratitude, as\nserving God, or as doing good deeds. Of course, humans and the jinn, uniquely among\nall creatures, may opt to defy their creator, but will then sufer due punishment. The\nsame normative nexus between God’s creation and benevolent furnishing of the earth, on\nthe one hand, and the obligations resting upon its human inhabitants, on the other, also\nunderwrites the frequent Qur’anic warnings against “wreaking corruption on earth” or\n“in the land” (→ ˻afsada fī l-a rḍ): to commit certain moral and religious transgressions\nis to go against the normative order that it behoves the residents of the earth to uphold.\nThose who nonetheless sin obstinately and egregiously will be obliterated by a cataclys-\nmic divine intervention (or, in the Medinan surahs, sufer military defeat at the hands of\nthe believers) and be replaced by other divinely appointed “deputies” (khalāʾif/khulafāʾ,\nsingular: khalīfah) in their stead (see under → istakhlafa).\n“The earth” or “the land”? As emerges from the material surveyed so far, many Qur’anic\noccurrences of al-a rḍ have an undeniably universal and global purport that requires the\ntranslation “the earth.” This is true not only for the merism al- samāwāt wa- l- arḍ but for\nmany other verses as well (e.g., Q 2:36.51, 6:38.59, 10:24, 11:6.61, 13:3.18.31, 15:19, 16:15,\n17:90, 18:7.45.47, 20:53, 31:27, 39:69, 71:17–19.26, 73:14). The term arḍ allāh, too, which\noccurs only in Q 4:97, 7:73, 11:64, and 39:10 (cf. 29:56), is best rendered “God’s earth,” in\ncontrast to the use of ereṣ YHWH, “God’s land,” in Hos 9:3 (Peshitta: arʿeh d- māryā) to\nmean the land that God is said to have gifted to the Israelites. On the other hand, there\nare Qur’anic verses in which arḍ clearly denotes a specific portion of the earth and is ac-\ncordingly to be rendered “land.” For example, in Q 5:21 Moses commands the Israelites to\nenter “the Holy Land” (al- arḍ al- muqaddasah), while elsewhere the Qur’an’s divine voice\nrefers to the Holy Land as “the land that we have blessed” (Q 21:71.81: al- arḍ allatī bāraknā\n42 arḍ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:65", "title": "Page 65", "locator": "pdf_page:65", "text": "fīhā; see similarly 7:137 and 34:18).22 Nor is the occurrence of arḍ in the restricted sense\nof “land” confined to what we would think of as Biblical Palestine. Thus, vario us Qur’anic\nscenes, including accounts of the confrontation between Moses and Pha raoh, mention\nthe threat or the fear that people might be “driven out from” (in the active: akhraja min)\ntheir own or somebody e lse’s land (Q 7:110, 14:13, 20:57.63, 26:35, all of which combine arḍ\nwith a possessive suffix; see also 17:76, which lacks the suffix, and 28:57, where “our land”\ndesignates the region around the Qur’anic sanctuary). Another instance of this usage\nis Q 31:34, contrasting God’s omniscience with the fact that no human “knows in which\nland he will die” (wa-m ā tadrī nafsun bi- ayyi arḍin tamūtu). The threat of banishment\nmina l- arḍi in Q 5:33, too, must refer to banishment from the region around and controlled\nby Medina, however widely conceived, rather than to exile from earth altogether; the\nappropriate translation of yunfaw mina l- arḍi here is therefore “they are banished from\nthe land.” To add a final example, in Q 12:55 Joseph asks the king of Egypt to appoint him\noverseer over “the store houses of the land” (qāla jʿalnī ʿalā khazāʾini l- arḍi) rather than\nthose of the entire earth.23\nBy way of a general rule of thumb, when al- arḍ occurs in statements that are explic itly\nor implicitly concerned with humanity at large, it o ught to be translated as “the earth”; by\ncontrast, if it figures in statements concerned with a certain subset of humanity or specific\nindividuals, “the land” will often be the more appropriate translation. In navigating the am-\nbiguity “earth” vs “land” that inheres in the word arḍ, it is therefore contextual observations\nthat often provide vital clues. In par tic ul ar, cases in which the word arḍ combines with a\npossessive suffix clearly necessitate the translation “land.” Examples are Q 7:110, where\nthe Egyptian notables accuse Moses of “wanting to expel youp from your land” (yurīdu an\nyukhrijakum min arḍikum), and 33:27, reminding the Medinan believers that God has “made\nyoup inherit the land, h ouses, and possessions” of their enemies from among the scripture-\nowners (wa- awrathakum arḍahum wa- diyārahum wa- amwālahum).\nNonetheless, t here are vario us locutions for which it remains difficult to decide w hether\nal- arḍ should be rendered “the earth” or rather as “the land,” understood in the unspecific\nsense of what ever region of the earth is contextually implied. Cases at hand are → sāra fī\nl- arḍ, “to travel the earth” or “to journey through the land”; → ˻afsada fī l- arḍ, “to wreak\ncorruption on earth” or “in the land”; waritha l- arḍ, “to inherit the earth” or “the land”\n(Q 7:100.128.137, 19:40, 21:105, 28:5, 39:74; also 33:27, cited above and discussed in more\ndetail below); and ustuḍʿifa fī l- arḍ, “to be oppressed on earth” or “in the land” (Q 4:97,\n8:26, 28:5; see also 7:137; → istaḍʿafa). In some verses, context favours the restricted op-\ntion “in the land.” This is the case for Q 28:5–6, where alladhīna stuḍʿifū fī l- arḍi (“ those\noppressed in the land”) are the Israelites reduced to servitude in Egypt and where the\ncontrasting promise of “establishment” fī l- arḍ (“in the land”) pertains specifically to Egypt\n22 Another reference to the Holy Land in similar terms is found at Q 17:1, mentioning “the distant place of\nprostration whose environs we have blessed” (al- masjid al- aqṣā lladhī bāraknā ḥawlahu), meaning the Jerusalem\ntemple (see SPMC 227–232, 239).\n23 For other cases in which al- arḍ without additional qualifications or the indeterminate arḍ signify a certain\nportion of the earth or “the land” that is contextually implied, rather than “the earth,” see Q 8:67, 7:137, and 12:9.\nSee also Q 17:104, where the Israelites are instructed to “dwell in the land” (uskunū l- arḍa). The context as well\nas comparison with thematically parallel passages makes it clear that the land in question is (or at least includes)\nEgypt; see Sinai 2017b, 203.\narḍ 43", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In other cases, context points in the opposite direction, as in\nQ 19:40, where the divine statement innā naḥnu narithu l-a rḍa wa- man ʿalayhā ought to be\nrendered, “We will inherit the earth and every one on it.” Yet not infrequently it is difficult\nto make up one’s mind one way or another.\n“The land” = the Holy Land? It is however impor tant to stress that even where a verse’s\ncontext supports rendering al-a rḍ as “the land,” it would be unwarranted to opt for a\ndefault equation of such Qur’anic references with t hose seen in Biblical passages that em-\nploy the expression hāʾāreṣ, “the land” (Peshitta: arʿā), to denote the land conquered and\ncolonised by the Israelites (e.g., Exod 23:29–31, Exod 34:15, Lev 18:25.27.28, Lev 19:23.29,\nLev 25:2.6.18.19.23). It is not, in other words, exegetically licit to treat al- arḍ as a mere ab-\nbreviation for al- arḍ al- muqaddasah (“the Holy Land”) from Q 5:21.24 Rather, even where\nal- arḍ with the determinate article refers not to “the earth” as a w hole, it normally stands\nfor “the land” in an unspecific or general sense, at least in the absence of clear contextual\nsignals pointing to the territory of the ancient Israelites in par tic u lar (as is arguable for the\nindictment of Israelite “corruption in the land” in Q 17:4).\nThis is not merely a philological cavil but heralds a larger interpretive claim, namely, that\nthe Qur’an, with the pos sib le exception of an enigmatic remark in Q 33:27 (see below), does\nnot express a sustained and unequivocal claim, on behalf of the community of believers\naround Muhammad, to legitimate possession of the Holy Land. In this regard, the Qur’an\nstands in notable tension with an early non-I slamic portrayal of the Arab conquerors of\nthe Middle East, the Armenian chronicle of Pseudo- Sebeos, which singles out the proj ect\nof conquering the Holy Land as pivotal to Muhammad’s preaching: “Now you, you are the\nsons of Abraham, and God will realise in you the promise made to Abraham and his pos-\nterity. Only love the God of Abraham, and go and take possession of your country which\nGod gave to your f ather Abraham,” Muhammad is quoted as urging the Arabs (Hoyland\n1997, 129–131). Yet while the Qur’an does indeed once call Abraham the believers’ “ father”\n(Q 22:78; → ab),25 its explicit territorial claims are generally l imited to wresting control over\nthe Meccan sanctuary from the associators (Q 2:191 and 9:17–18.28; see under → jāhada\nas well as Sinai 2015–2016, 56–57, and HCI 50). As Reuven Firestone has duly stressed,\nthe Qur’an does not articulate a message of territorial conquest (Firestone 2015), even\nthough it does frequently incite the believers to militant action or “contending” (jāhada)\n“on God’s path.”\nA potential exception to the claim that the Qur’an is generally uninterested in conquest\nof the Holy Land is Q 33:27, which follows a comment on the believers’ victory over\nthe local “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al-k itāb) and continues by saying that God “gave\nyoup as an inheritance their land (awrathakum arḍahum), houses, and possessions, and\nland / a land you have/had not yet trodden (wa- arḍan lam taṭaʾūhā)” (see Hoyland 1997,\n130–131, and Shoemaker 2018, 156–157).

Perhaps the prospect held out in this verse is related to\nQ 9:29, which envisages that those recipients of the scripture (i.e., Jews and Christians)\nwhose beliefs and practices fall short of Qur’anic standards are to be fought “u ntil they\nhumbly give tributary compensation (al-j izyah) without re sis tance (ʿan yadin)” (see in\nmore detail u nder → jāhada). Q 9:29 and 33:27 could be eying an expansion of the Qur’anic\nbelievers’ territorial hegemony to include Jewish- inhabited Arabian oases like Khaybar\n(Veccia Vaglieri 1978 and Munt 2021). It may also be that the land not yet trodden from\nQ 33:27 is land already acquired— land “that you had not yet trodden” rather than “land\nthat you have not yet trodden.” Still, it is not impossible that Q 33:27 is an oblique reference\nto Byzantine Palestine or part thereof.\nIn any case, what ever the correct construal of this rather cursory remark in Q 33:27, it\nis difficult to marshal further Qur’anic evidence articulating an agenda of conquering the\nHoly Land, based on an Abrahamic claim of territorial inheritance along the lines of Pseudo-\nSebeos (against Shoemaker 2018, 157–158). Additional Qur’anic verses like Q 2:114 that have\nbeen adduced to show that the Qur’an chimes with Pseudo- Sebeos and that a claim to the\nHoly Land was an integral component of Muhammad’s preaching are far from compelling.27\nRather than focussing on the believers’ conquest of the Holy Land in par tic ul ar, the Qur’an\nis concerned with God’s gift of the earth to humans in general, or of specific portions of it\nto specific communities of the past or pre sent, and with the broad obligation of gratitude\nto God that is taken to follow from h uman usufruct of “the land.”\nisrāʾīl: banū ~ pl. | the Israelites\nFurther vocabulary discussed: al- yahūd, alladhīna hādū, hūd pl. | the Jews a l- naṣārā\npl. | t he Christians i brāhīm | A braham i smāʿīl | I shmael m ūsā | M oses ʿ īsā | J esus\njālūt | Goliath ṭālūt | Saul firʿawn | Pha raoh yaḥyā | John dhikr | (hortatory)\nreminder, reminding exhortation zubur al-a wwalīn | the writings of the ancients\n27 Shoemaker seeks to establish that the reference to God’s “places of prostration” (masājid allāh) in\nQ 2:114— which denounces “ those who prevent God’s places of prostration from having his name invoked at\nthem (an yudhkara fīhā smuhū) and strive for their destruction”—is to be identified with the Jerusalem Temple\nMount (Shoemaker 2018, 157–158, based on Bashear 1989): “Surely if this verse w ere bound to the Meccan sanc-\ntuary from early on, we would not find a widespread reinterpretation that moved it to Jerusalem.” However,\nI have no difficulty countenancing a scenario in which the verse’s general allusion to destroying “God’s places of\nprostration” (note the plural!) might have brought to the minds of early exegetes the Jerusalem temple, which\nunlike the Meccan sanctuary had been razed to the ground in the pre- Islamic period, a fact that was known\nalready in the Qur’an’s original environment (see Q 17:7, using the singular masjid). Engaging in their usual\nnarrative guesswork, early interpreters then identified e ither the Christians or, alternatively, Nebuchadnezzar\nand his army as the culprits condemned by the verse (e.g., Muqātil 2002, 1:132; Ṭab. 2:442–444)—i ncluding\nthe fantastic compromise version that the Christians w ere so consumed with hatred of the Jews that they aided\nNebuchadnezzar in devastating the t emple. Yet apart from the generic reference to “places of prostration” in the\nplural, the wording of Q 2:114 does not make it at all clear that any destruction has actually taken place: the verse\nmight simply be reprimanding those with destructive designs on sanctuaries in general. The early interpreters’\nleap from an ambition to destroy to actual destruction facilitates precisely the sort of dramatic concretisation\nthat permeates much early narrative exegesis. “Anti- Christian/Byzantine sentiment” (Bashear 1989, 220, 221, 232)\nmay be a further significant impetus that shaped the exegetical traditions in question. None of these narratives,\nhowever, bring us any closer to the original meaning of the verse or permit an argument that Q 2:114 documents\nthe Qur’anic believers’ “concern for Jerusalem and its sanctuary, as well as, presumably, their determination to\nliberate both from Byzantine mistreatment” (Shoemaker 2018, 158).\nisrāʾīl 45", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It may be further contextualised with the collective self- designation\n“Israel” (yisraʾēl) in rabbinic lit er a ture (e.g., m. Sanh. 10:1) and references to the “ people”\n(s2ʿb) of Israel (ys3rʾl) in Ḥimyarite epigraphy (e.g., Robin 2003, 125; Robin 2004, 844,\n848–856). Two Qur’anic verses (Q 3:93, 19:58) employ isrāʾīl as a personal name, presum-\nably for the ancestor of the banū isrāʾīl.1 Later exegetes reasonably identify the individual\nin question with the patriarch Jacob (e.g., Zam. 1:584; see also JPND 154 and FVQ 61), in\nconformity with Gen 32:28–29, where Jacob is given the name yisraʾēl in commemoration\nof his nocturnal wrestling with a mysterious superhuman figure.\nThe etymology of isrāʾīl and the pre- Qur’anic origin of the Qur’an’s Biblical ono-\nmasticon. The Qur’anic form isrāʾīl, with the opening syllable is- rather than yis- , would\nseem to have been loaned via Syriac or Christian Palestinian Aramaic rather than directly\nfrom Hebrew yiśrāʾēl (JPND 154–155; KU 91; CQ 176; FVQ 61). It is true that the word-i nitial\nglottal stop of isrāʾīl also features in the Arabic names ibrāhīm, “Abraham,”2 and ismāʿīl,\n1 The relevant segment of Q 3:93 (also discussed u nder → tawrāh) runs: “All food was permitted to the Is-\nraelites, except what Israel prohibited to himself (illā mā ḥarrama isrāʾīlu ʿalā nafsihi), before the Torah was sent\ndown” (see Witztum 2011, 277–278). It is the singular possessive pronoun in ʿalā nafsihi that supports construing\nisrāʾīl as the name of an individual rather than as a collective. In Q 19:58, the name isrāʾīl stands in conjunction\nwith Abraham.\n2 As van Putten has noted, the Qur’anic rasm vacillates between the spellings مىهرىا and مهرىا for Abraham\n(with some diferences between the consonantal skeleton of current print editions and early manuscripts). مهرىا\nis “an archaic spelling” of the name that reflects its Aramaic orthography (van Putten 2020a, 2) and largely\ncorresponds to the variant reading ibrāhām, whose distribution is studied in detail in van Putten (2020a). Puin\nhas suggested that the standard vocalisation ibrāhīm emerged from a misreading of the spelling مىهرىا whereby a\ndenticle originally serving as a mater lectionis for ā was misconstrued as indicating ī. The original pronunciation\nwould accordingly have been abrāhām, in line with the usual Jewish and Christian vocalisation of the name\n(Bothmer et al. 1999, 39–40). Serving as a mater lectionis for ā does indeed seem to have been a pos sib le function\nof the denticle in early Arabic orthography (see the spelling of → tawrāh as هىروت as well as Déroche 2009, 60,\ndocumenting the word ilāh, “god,” being spelled هىلا). Nonetheless, it is not likely that this is the original signifi-\ncance of the denticle when used in the Arabic name of Abraham, since the reading abrāhām may be ruled out\nfor the simple reason that it would disrupt the rhyme at Q 15:51, 21:60.62.69, 26:69, and 37:83.104.109. Note that\nthe data in van Putten (2020a) does not suggest that the spelling مىهرىا is l imited to rhyme position (see, e.g., مىهرىا\ninside Q 33:7). Had this been the case, one might have argued that an original version abrāhām only underwent\noccasional variation to abrāhīm or ibrāhīm due to local constraints of rhyme, just as ṭūr saynāʾ, “Mount Sinai”\n(Q 23:20), is in Q 95:2 adjusted to ṭūr sīnīn in order to satisfy the surah’s rhyme.

This\nraises the question w hether isrāʾīl might be sufficiently accounted for as a parallel formation\nto ibrāhīm, with whom it is paired in Q 19:58, rather than as an immediate carry- over from\nSyriac or Christian Palestinian Aramaic. However, the vowel structure of the name ibrāhīm\nitself departs significantly from its Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic counter parts and is best\nexplained as having been patterned on ismāʿīl (JPND 160; KU 91–92; FVQ 44–46), whose\nword-i nitial glottal stop again conforms to Syriac and Christian Palestinian Aramaic rather\nthan to Hebrew yišmāʿêl (JPND 155–156; KU 91–92; FVQ 64; Dye and Kropp 2011, 181–182).3\nThis leads back to the view that the Arabic names isrāʾīl and ismāʿīl reflect some version of\nChristian Aramaic, such as Syriac, as do other Biblical proper names in the Qur’an, such\nas firʿawn, “Pha raoh” (JPND 169; KU 130–131).\nThe preceding discussion gives rise to the general observation that the Qur’an’s Biblical\nonomasticon is most likely considerably older than Muhammad rather than having been\ncoined only in the early sixth c entury. For if ibrāhīm was patterned on ismāʿīl, then the form\nibrāhīm must have emerged in a milieu in which Ibrāhīm = Abraham was associated with\nthe figure of his son Ismāʿīl = Ishmael. Yet the chronologically earliest Qur’anic references\nto Abraham and Ishmael do not pre sent them as father and son (Q 19:54–55, 21:85–86,\n38:48; cf. Q 6:86; see KU 91 and Paret 1978), even if it is pos sib le to understand some of the\nrelevant textual data to reflect a difuse awareness that Ishmael is of general Abrahamite\ndescent (Goudarzi 2019, 473–474).4 Given the lack of explicit Meccan indications that\nAbraham was the father of Ishmael, the form ibrāhīm likely predates the Qur’an rather\nthan being a product of the Qur’an’s immediate milieu.5 Likewise pre- Qur’anic, it seems,\nspelling مهرىا in the Qur’an would seem to reflect a stage at which Abraham’s Arabic name had not yet under gone\npattern assimilation to ismāʿīl. However, w hether the corresponding archaic pronunciation ending in - ām rather\nthan - īm was still in use in the Qur’anic milieu seems less certain to me; perhaps مهرىا is merely a scribal\narchaicism.\n3 The Christian Palestinian Aramaic version of Ishmael’s name, as opposed to the Syriac one, also has an s\nrather than sh (cf. Greek ismaēl), yielding an even closer fit with the Arabic form. However, in Biblical names in\nthe Qur’an, Hebrew or Syriac sh generally corresponds to s (e.g., mūsā, sulaymān, ʿīsā). As recognised by Horovitz\n(KU 81; cf. JPND 155; see also Dye and Kropp 2011, 184), we may be confronted with a general phonetic rule here.\nIt should also be noted that personal names very similar to the Qur’anic ismāʿīl are attested already in the pre-\nQur’anic Arabian epigraphic rec ord, such as ys1mʿʾl in Sabaic and ys1mʿʾl, ys1mʿl, and ʾs1mʿl in Safaitic (e.g., Stein\n2007, 42–43; see already JPND 155 and KU 92). Perhaps this pre- existing Arabic name meaning “God hears” or\n“May God hear” was secondarily equated or a conflated with a similar Biblical one, a pro cess that Ahmad Al-\nJallad describes as “phonosemantic matching” (Al- Jallad and Al-M anaser 2021, 125–126). As for the alternative\nbetween Christian Palestinian Aramaic or Syriac, a rare case in which a derivation from Christian Palestinian\nAramaic or Ethiopic, reflecting Greek, is clearly preferable to Syriac is yūnus, “Jonah,” who is called yawnān in\nSyriac, without an s (KU 154–155; JPND 170; CQ 176–177; Dye and Kropp 2011, 175). Another such case may be\nilyās, “Elijah” (KU 99; JPND 171; CQ 176–177; but see Dye and Kropp 2011, 175).\n4 For an alternative explanation of the absence of any explicit link between the characters called Ismāʿīl and\nAbraham in the Meccan surahs, see ʿAbd al-R āziq 2021. She argues that the Meccan Ismāʿīl is to be identified\nwith the Biblical Samuel and notes, among other things, that the Meccan Ismāʿīl twice appears together with\nElisha (al- yasaʿ; Q 6:86, 38:48), suggesting that he is to be positioned well after the time of Abraham. However,\nthe fact that in Q 6:85–86 Lot concludes a list of prophetic figures that also includes, earlier on, John the Baptist\nand Jesus should perhaps dispose one to be wary of invariably attributing historical implications to the order in\nwhich Qur’anic personalities are enumerated.\n5 The only verse in a Meccan surah that explic itly pairs Ishmael and Isaac as Abraham’s sons is Q 14:39,\nwhere Abraham thanks God for the fact that he “gave me Ishmael and Isaac, despite [my] old age.” It has been\nisrāʾīl 47", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is pos si ble, of course, that t here was more than one pre- Qur’anic Arabic\nversion of a given Biblical name, and that the Qur’anic proclamations exercised a certain\namount of choice among existing alternatives. The conjecture that there could have been\ncases of parallel nomenclature is supported by the fact that the Qur’an calls the devil both\niblīs, from Greek ho diabolos, and → al- shayṭān, very likely u nder the impact of Ethiopic\nsayṭān. In addition, Q 19:13— where the divine speaker reports having endowed John the\nBaptist, or the Qur’anic Yaḥyā, with ḥanān, “tenderness, compassion”— could be a pun\nultimately g oing back to the Hebrew or Syriac version of the protagonist’s name (yôḥānān,\nyūḥannān). If so, the pun presupposes either that the Qur’anic addressees were familiar\nwith the way in which the Qur’anic Yaḥyā was referred to in languages other than Arabic\nor that there was a variant Arabic version of his name that was closer to Syriac yūḥannān.6\nBut even if some Biblical or Biblically based figures may have had more than one name\nin pre- Qur’anic Arabic, the fact that one par tic u lar version ended up being preferred by\nthe Qur’an could simply have been determined by the usage that was locally predominant\nrather than having any deeper theological significance.\nCon temporary Israelites in the Qur’an. From early on, the Israelites figure in connection\nwith the past, especially the c areer of Moses (e.g., Q 17:2–8, 26:17, 44:30, 45:16; cf. KU 91).\nOn occasion, however, the Israelites appear to be or include contemporaries of the Qur’anic\nMessenger. Th ese cont emporary Israelites are most likely Jews.7 For the Medinan surahs,\ngiven their explicit polemical engagement with Jews (→ al- yahūd), a cont emporary usage\nof the term “Israelites” is scarcely remarkable. Thus, Q 2:211 commands, in the singular,\n“Ask the Israelites how many clear signs we gave them!,” while three e arlier verses of Surah\n2 (vv. 40, 47, and 122) exhort the Israelites (yā- banī isrāʾīla) in a manner suggesting that\nthey form part of Muhammad’s audience.8 But references to present- day Israelites occur\nsuggested that the entire passage Q 14:35–41 might be a Medinan insertion. This is not certain (see Sinai 2009,\n106–112), but it might still be the case that the original version of Q 14:39 had Abraham give thanks for God’s\nbestowal of Isaac alone and that the verse was secondarily expanded to include Ishmael. For a dif er ent reading\nthat considers the reference to Ishmael to be original, see Goudarzi 2019, 476.\n6 I owe the point about the name of John to a comment by Saqib Hussain. It would of course be pos-\nsi ble to read the consonantal sequence y- ḥ-y -y , written without diacritical dots, as y- ḥ-n -y , corresponding\nto yuḥannā (FVQ 290). I am however persuaded by Jefery’s option against this possibility in view of the epi-\ngraphic attestation of the name yaḥyā.\n7 Some scholars have argued that the Qur’an classes cont emporary Christians, too, as Israelites. My own\nview, at the pre sent moment, is that the reference of the expression banū isrāʾīl does not include con temporary\nChristians (see in more detail u nder → al- naṣārā).

Two cases in point are Q 17:101, where the affirmation that God\nprovided Moses with nine “clear signs” is followed by the interjection, “Ask the Israelites!”\n(cf. the similar command to “ask” the ahl al- dhikr, or “recipients of reminding exhortation,”\nin 16:43 and 21:7), and 27:76, averring that “this → qurʾān recounts to the Israelites most of\nthat about which they are in disagreement.” To be sure, in Q 43:45 the divine voice instructs\nthe Messenger to “ask t hose of our messengers whom we have sent before you w hether we\nhave appointed any gods to be served apart from the Merciful.” From this one may infer\nthat not every one whom the Qur’anic Messenger is bidden to “ask” is necessarily assumed\nto be currently alive. Even so, t here is no compelling reason to suppose that the Israelites\nmentioned in Q 17:101 and 27:76 are considered to be defunct.\nTwo further Meccan allusions to cont emporary Israelites are even more noteworthy.\nOne is Q 26:196–197, which together with 44:30 may well contain one of the two chrono-\nlogically earliest occurrences of the term banū isrāʾīl in the Qur’an.9 The passage maintains\nthat “it”— meaning e ither the preceding punishment narratives or the Qur’anic revelations\nin general—is contained “in the writings of the ancients” (fī zuburi l- awwalīn; → zabūr)\nand that the “learned ones” among the Israelites “know it” (an yaʿlamahu ʿulamāʾu banī\nisrāʾīl): certain Israelites, the passage is saying, agree or are at least disposed to agree with\nwhat has been revealed to Muhammad. An even more explicit claim to Israelite agreement\noccurs at Q 46:10. The verse follows an assertion that the Qur’anic Messenger is not “an\ninnovation among the messengers” (v. 9: qul mā kuntu bidʿan mina l-r usuli) and that he\nonly follows “what is conveyed” to him (mā yūḥā ilayya), upon which the Qur’anic adver-\nsaries are invited to consider the possibility that “it”— namely, the revelations conveyed\nto Muhammad— really might be “from God,” while “youp repudiate [it] (wa- kafartum),\nwhereas a witness from among the Israelites bears testimony to something like it (wa-\nshahida shāhidun min banī isrāʾīla ʿalā mithlihi); he has espoused belief and you have behaved\nhaughtily (fa-ā mana wa-s takbartum).” The use of the singular h ere is striking: Q 46:10 would\nseem to allude to an individual Israelite (shāhidun min banī isrāʾīla) whose identity was\npresumably known or knowable to the addressees. In general, t here is a strong case for\naccepting that a statement like Q 46:10, in order to be rhetorically efective, presupposes\nthat there were actual Israelites in the milieu of the Meccan Qur’an, Israelites who were\nknown to hold views that concurred with some of the Qur’an’s teachings.\nThis scenario also fits with other Meccan statements claiming that those to whom\nGod has previously “given the scripture” recognise, believe in, or rejoice in the Qur’anic\nrevelations (Q 6:20.114, 10:94, 13:36, 28:52–53, and 29:47). At least some of t hese verses\nvoice an unmistakable claim that con temporary scripturalists acknowledge the truth of\nthe Qur’anic revelations. Thus, according to Q 28:53, when God’s word is recited to those\nwho were formerly given the scripture (v. 52: alladhīna ātaynāhumu l- kitāba min qablihi),\nthey say, “We believe in it; it is the truth from our Lord” (āmannā bihī innahu l-ḥ aqqu min\nrabbinā). It seems doubtful that one is entitled to brush such passages aside by positing\n9 Nöldeke assigns both Surah 26 and Surah 44 to the second Meccan period, but their mean verse length\n(around thirty- six transliteration letters per verse) is comparable to that of surahs like Q 68 and 51 (see HCI\n114–116), which are early Meccan by Nöldeke’s reckoning. In the absence of further considerations, they should\ntherefore be classed as early Meccan.\nisrāʾīl 49", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Also relevant in this context is the allega-\ntion by anonymous opponents that the Qur’anic Messenger is being “taught by a h uman”\n(Q 16:103: annahum yaqūlūna innamā yuʿallimuhu basharun): the fact that the Qur’anic\nopponents were able to voice this charge would make excellent sense if there was indeed\nsome degree of interaction between the Qur’anic community and individual Jewish and/\nor Christian scripture- bearers, a claim that has recently been argued by Holger Zellentin\n(Zellentin, forthcoming).\nThe fact that Q 26:196–197 and 46:10 speak of Israelites in par tic u lar rather than more\ngenerally of scripture- bearers points to a presence specifically of Jewish interlocutors, at\nleast on the assumption that the Qur’anic use of “the Israelites” does not include Chris-\ntians but rather is limited to Jews.10 This undermines the conventional supposition that it\nwas only after the hijrah that the Qur’anic community came into sustained contact with\nexponents of the Jewish tradition. It is true that the eschatology of the Meccan surahs,\nwhich forms their undeniable kerygmatic centre, has strong affinities with Syriac Chris-\ntian ity (Sinai 2017a). At least two features of the Meccan surahs’ theology, however, are\nmore easily placed against a Jewish background. In the first instance, this applies to the\nQur’anic critique of illegitimate “association” of God with other beings, which is prominent\nfrom the early Meccan period onwards and stands in continuity with rabbinic statements\nemploying the Hebrew verb shittēp or cognates thereof (see u nder → ashraka). To be sure,\nthe link could theoretically be an indirect one; but the rabbinic genealogy of the Qur’anic\nconcept of associationism and also the midrashic character of some Meccan narratives and\nnarrative motifs (e.g., Q 10:90–92, on which see Sinai 2019a) accords well with a reading of\npassages like Q 46:10 that holds them to indicate real and non-p olemical interaction with\ncon temporary Israelites. The same applies to the Qur’an’s evident lack of discomfort with\nanthropomorphic and anthropopathic language about God (see under → allāh), which is\nwell established already in the Meccan surahs and is arguably closer to rabbinic Judaism\nthan to the mainstream of late antique Christ ian ity. Fi nally, the cons pic u ous appearance\nof the divine name al- raḥmān (“the Merciful”) around the time of the transition from the\nearly Meccan surahs to the l ater Meccan ones may also need to be placed against a rabbinic\nbackground, although in this case we can identify a fairly indisputable intermediate stage\nof transition via South Arabia (see in detail under → al- raḥmān).11\n10 See under → al- naṣārā, arguing that Q 61:14 does not entail that cont emporary Christians qualify as Isra-\nelites. For the contrary view that the Qur’anic Israelites include Christians, see Zellentin 2013, 163–164, relying\non the understanding of the Israelite people in the Didascalia Apostolorum.\n11 But note that the Meccan surahs show at least one instance of striking terminological divergence from\nwell- entrenched Jewish usage in a thematic context in which one might well have expected this usage to man-\nifest itself: the Israelite temple is called a → masjid, or “place of prostration/worship” (Q 17:1.7), and a miḥrāb,\n“sanctuary” (Q 19:11; see also, in the Medinan Qur’an, Q 3:37.39; for more detail, refer to → bayt); it is never\nexplic itly described with an expression that could be linked to Hebrew ha- miqdash / bēt ha- miqdash or Aramaic\nmaqdhsa or be/bet maqdsha (DTTM 829; DJBA 215, 701), such as the post- Qur’anic expression bayt al- maqdis.\nAs regards Q 19:11, this likely reflects the fact that the narrative in question is a Christian one (Horovitz 1927,\n50 isrāʾīl", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Israelite history as recounted in the Qur’an\nhas a twin peak in the figures of Moses and Jesus (see in more detail Schmid, forthcoming\na; Pregill, forthcoming; Reynolds, forthcoming). Moses is sent by God as a messenger to\nPha raoh and, after God’s unleashing of several plagues, f rees the Israelites from slavery\nand oppression (e.g., Q 7:103–137, 20:9–98, 28:3–42). These events are followed by God’s\nrevelation on Mount Sinai and his conclusion of a covenant, called mīthāq (Q 2:63.83.84.93,\n4:154.155, 5:12.13.70) or ʿahd (Q 2:40; see under → wāthaqa), with the Israelites, but also\nby frequent instances of Israelite insubordination, discontent, and disobedience, including\nthe Israelites’ manufacturing and veneration of the Golden Calf (e.g., Q 2:47–61, 7:138–171,\n20:80–98). Several passages speak of Israelite kings a fter Moses, specifically, Ṭālūt (= Saul;\nsee JPND 162–163 and KU 123), David, and Solomon (e.g., Q 2:246–251, 27:15–44, 38:17–\n40); and according to Q 17:4–8 God twice punished the Israelites for “wreaking corruption\n(→ afsada) on earth,” by sending against them enemy invaders who penetrated as far as\nthe Israelites’ place of worship (masjid; → sajada), which must be the Jerusalem temple.\nAt an indefinite time a fter Moses, God sent Jesus “as a messenger to the Israelites” (Q 3:49;\nsee also 61:6), triggering a veritable schism of the Israelites into two factions (singular:\nṭāʾifah), a believing one and an unbelieving or “repudiating” one (Q 61:14; see in more\ndetail under → al- naṣārā).\nQur’anic polemics against the Israelites. According to Q 2:47.122, God favoured\nthe Israelites over all other world- dwellers (wa-a nnī faḍḍaltukum ʿalā l- ʿālamīn; see\nalso u nder → darajah), and several verses remind them of the special grace (niʿmah;\nsee under → anʿama) that God has bestowed on them (Q 2:40.47.122; see also 2:211 and\n20:80–81) and of the blessings promised to them in return for adhering to a certain num-\nber of precepts (Q 5:12). The Qur’an’s portrayal of the Israelites’ behaviour in response to\nGod’s grace, however, is largely negative. Although the most detailed Qur’anic accounts\nof the Israelites’ worship of the Golden Calf are found in two Meccan surahs (Q 7:148–154,\n20:80–98), the majority of passages that are overtly critical of the Israelites’ religious track\nrec ord are Medinan. This forms a marked contrast with the Meccan verses surveyed above\nthat cast the Israelites as real or potential witnesses to the truth of the Qur’anic revelations.\nMany of the Qur’an’s polemical charges against the Israelites are paralleled by statements\nmade regarding the Jews (→ al- yahūd, alladhīna hādū) and the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl\nal- kitāb), indicating considerable overlap between all three terms—an observation easily\nrationalised by positing that the Qur’an views the Jews as the con temporary descendents\nof the Mosaic Israelites and as forming, together with the Christians, one of the two prin-\ncipal branches of the scripturalists.\nOne of the specific accusations levelled against the Israelites is that they killed God’s\nprophets (Q 2:61.87.91, 5:70). This is a trope of Christian anti- Jewish polemic (cf. Matt\n23:30–31.37, Acts 7:52, or Justin’s Dialogue with Trypho 16 = Roberts et al. 1995, 1:202; see\nCQ 156–157 and Reynolds 2012) that also occurs in connection with the scripture- owners\n(Q 3:112 and 4:155). In addition, the Israelites are alleged to have broken God’s covenant\n(mīthāq; Q 5:13), also a charge that is directed against the scripturalists (Q 4:155).12 Again\n261–262); but the same is not the case for the beginning of Q 17:4–8, which merely ofer an allusive account of\nthe two destructions of the Jerusalem t emple. The word that is used for the Jerusalem t emple h ere, masjid, would\nseem to have been a generic designation for a place of worship.\n12 Regarding the identity of the group mentioned in Q 4:155, see the reference to the scripture- owners in\nv. 153.

This echoes Christian allegations of Jewish misin-\nterpretation of the Old Testament (e.g., Justin’s Dialogue with Trypho 71–73, 84 = Roberts\net al. 1995, 1:234–235.241, a parallel I owe to CQ 157; see also Reynolds 2010b, 196–200).\nIn return for their disobedience, the Israelites, or a party among them, are on several oc-\ncasions singled out as objects of divine wrath or threatened therewith (gh- ḍ- b; Q 2:61.90,\n7:152, 20:81.86; see Rubin 2003a, 25; → ghaḍiba), a notion that is, once again, also found\nin connection with the scripture- owners (Q 3:112, 5:60). Apart from these general in-\ndictments, the Qur’an also narrates vario us episodes of Israelite or Jewish disobedience,\ningratitude, or petulance. The most prominent of t hese is the episode of the Golden Calf,\nbut it is by no means the only such story or scene (e.g., Q 2:57–61).\nThe Israelites as a mixed bag. Despite the starkly polemical nature of many Qur’anic\ntreatments of the Israelites, several Qur’anic passages are clearly less concerned to con-\ndemn all past and pre sent Israelites lock, stock, and barrel than to highlight that the Isra-\nelites encompassed and encompass both believers and repudiators (e.g., Q 61:14).13 Side\nby side with stories of Israelite disobedience, the Qur’an also narrates instances of Israelite\nrepentance and of God’s ensuing forgiveness (e.g., Q 2:52.54.64, 7:149–153).14 Even the\nextended litany of Israelite sins in Q 2:40 f. is interrupted by an emphatic promise of\neschatological reward for Jews and Christians who “believe in God and the final day and\ndo right eous deeds” (Q 2:62; see u nder → aslama), while a l ater verse (Q 2:100) maintains\nthat whenever the Israelites or the scripturalists “conclude a covenant (ʿāhadū ʿahdan),\npart of them (farīqun minhum) cast it aside; no, most of them do not believe.” The following\nverse (Q 2:101) contains similarly diferential language: “part of those who were given the\nscripture” (farīqun mina lladhīna ūtū l- kitāba) “cast it behind their backs.” A comparable\nconcern to avoid condemnation of all Israelites is seen in Q 4:155, according to which\nGod has “sealed” (ṭabaʿa ʿalā; see u nder → khatama) the hearts of the scripture- owners\n(who clearly stand in for the Israelites here), “so that they do not believe, except for a\nfew.” Such language, moreover, matches two Medinan passages that declare outright that\nthe “scripture- owners” (ahl al- kitāb) include a community (→ ummah) that “stands up-\nright” (Q 3:113: qāʾimah) or is at least “moderate” or “middling” (Q 5:66: muqtaṣidah; see\nunder → aslama). The Qur’an accordingly portrays the Israelites, like the scripture- owners\nin general, as very much a mixed bag (see under → ˻ahl al- kitāb).\nGiven the verses just presented, the primary objective of the Qur’an’s miscellaneous\ncata logues of Israelite sins may be less to denounce the Israelites in their entirety than to\nlodge forceful disagreement with the claim ascribed to the Qur’anic Israelites in Q 2:94\nthat “the final abode with God” is theirs alone, “to the exclusion of all other people” (cf.\nQ 2:111). In addition, God’s prolonged multi- generational engagement with the Israelites,\nspanning the period from Moses to Jesus, throughout the Qur’an continues to function\nas a potent paradigm of the h uman condition, a condition defined by the choice between\nbelief and right eousness, on the one hand, and unbelief and sin, on the other, as well as by\nthe constant need for, but also possibility of, human repentance.

A total of twenty- nine Qur’anic surahs commence with a string of what are\ntraditionally called “disconnected letters” (ḥurūf muqaṭṭaʿah), which always follow di-\nrectly upon the basmalah (→ ˻bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm). The meaning of these letter\nsequences constitutes one of the perennial enigmas of Qur’anic exegesis, and the pre sent\nentry will pre sent and critique some of the solutions proposed in earlier scholarship.\nBefore embarking on a discussion of the putative significance of the disconnected\nletters, it will be useful to run through two facts. First, if the letters are pronounced by\ntheir names (such that Surah 2’s ʾ- l- m, for instance, is recited alif lām mīm), eigh teen of\nthe letter sequences (62%) exhibit a rhyme or phonetic assonance with the next verse or\nwith the remainder of the opening verse (Welch 1986, 414). Secondly, the verse or verses\nfollowing the letter sequence display recurrent terminological peculiarities (Ibn Kathīr\n1999, 1:160; Nöldeke 1892, 50–51; Schmid, forthcoming b, ch. 3). Thus, as illustrated by the\ntable below, twenty surahs with introductory letter sequences employ the term → kitāb\n(“scripture”) within the first three verses, and a further surah features at least a general\nreference to writing (Q 68:1: “By the pen and by what they write down!”); nine surahs\nwith introductory letters have the word qurʾān (→ qaraʾa) in the opening three verses;\nand only four surahs with introductory letters— namely, Surahs 19, 29, 30, 68—h ave nei-\nther kitāb nor qurʾān (both of which are highlighted in the table below) at the beginning.\nMoreover, twelve of the twenty- nine letter surahs feature the verbs → nazzala or anzala\nor a corresponding verbal noun in their first three verses (Surahs 3, 7, 12, 13, 14, 20, 32,\n40, 41, 44, 45, and 46; see also 2:4, 26:4), and ten of the letter surahs have the plural āyāt,\n“signs” or “sign- pronouncements” (singular: → āyah) in the first three verses (Surahs\n10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 26, 27, 28, 31, 41; see also 3:4, 40:4).\nThe second circumstance just noted permits being cross- checked against surahs that\ncontain similar terminology in their opening verses yet are devoid of initial letter sequences.\nAs it turns out, their number is quite limited in comparison. For example, only seven of\nthe eighty- five surahs that lack opening letter sequences contain the term → kitāb in the\nsense of “scripture” in their three opening verses (Surahs 17, 18, 39, 52, 59, 62, 98), and in\ntwo of these (Q 59:2 and 98:1) the word occurs as part of the construct expression → ˻ahl\nal- kitāb, so in a rather dif er ent context. If these latter two occurrences are disregarded,\nthen it emerges that of the twenty-fi ve surahs whose opening three verses employ kitāb in\nthe sense of “scripture,” twenty (80%) feature an initial letter sequence, while five (20%)\ndo not. For the eleven surah- initial occurrences of the word qurʾān, the corresponding\nratios are 82% (nine surahs that also have letter sequences) and 18% (two surahs that do\nnot, namely, Surahs 55 and 72). There is, accordingly, a con spic u ous and demonstrable\ncorrelation between the presence of letter strings, on the one hand, and the presence\nof key vocabulary in the ensuing verse or verses, on the other, and this correlation runs\nboth ways. As w ill be argued below, this may help shed light on the likely meaning of the\nisolated letters.\nA final preliminary remark, before embarking on a discussion of previous positions on\nthe meaning of the Qur’anic letter strings, concerns Surah 39. It lacks a surah- initial letter\nsequence but its opening verse—t anzīlu l-k itābi mina llāhi l- ʿazīzi l- ḥakīm, “A sending-\ndown of the scripture from God, the mighty and wise”— has very close surah- opening\n54 ʾ-l - r, ʾ-l -m , ʾ-l -m - r, ʾ-l - m- ṣ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The meaning of the Qur’anic letter\nsequences has been energetically debated both in premodern and modern scholarship.\nMedieval exegetes ofer a wide range of views ranging from agnosticism to elaborate cos-\nmological and numerological speculations, including attempts to view the letter sequences\nas abbreviations of par tic u lar phrases and expressions, such as divine names or attributes\n(GQ 2:69–72; Ayoub 1984, 56–62; SQ 13–14; see, e.g., Ṭab. 1:204–224 and al- Suyūṭī 1426\nAH, 1372–1392 = nawʿ 43). Similar “abbreviationist” construals (Massey 2003, 473–474)\nhave also been propounded by modern Western scholars, who have interpreted the letters\nas standing for specific Qur’anic terms or phrases, such as ʾ- l- r for al- raḥmān (Loth 1881,\n609–610; Bauer 1921, 16–20), as abridged surah titles (Goossens 1923), or as indicating the\npersons whose transcripts of Qur’anic material w ere utilised by Zayd ibn Thābit when he\ncompiled the standard recension of the Qur’anic text (Nöldeke 1860, 215–216; Hirschfeld\n1902, 141–143; Massey 1996). The opinion that the letter sequences form decipherable\nabbreviations, however, has not gone unchallenged: abandoning his earlier view, Nöldeke\nconcluded that the letter strings do not convey specific meanings but are “mystical allu-\nsions to the [Qur’an’s] celestial textual original” (Nöldeke 1892, 51; see also Jones 1962). As\nI shall argue in the final section of this entry, this is indeed the most promising approach\nto the issue.\nA second point of contention is the question whether the letter strings are integral\nparts of their respective surahs or secondary additions. The position that the letter strings\ndesignate the provenance of dif er ent textual witnesses collated by the Qur’an’s redactor\nor redactors obviously entails that they were not originally part of the surahs to which\nthey are now prefixed. This latter view can also be combined with other variatons of the\nabbreviationist approach; for instance, Goossens posits that the letters were added after\n56 ʾ-l - r, ʾ-l -m , ʾ-l -m - r, ʾ-l - m- ṣ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This hypothesis contains an impor tant insight, namely, that the letter\nstrings are unlikely to have entered the Qur’anic text at its final redactional stage. The\nreason for this is that the letter sequences appear to have caused the redactor(s) of the\nQur’an’s standard recension to modify a default propensity of arranging surahs by roughly\ndecreasing length: in a number of cases, surahs beginning with the same or very similar\nletter sequences w ere positioned next to one another even if from a purely quantitative\nperspective they ought to have been placed further apart (Bauer 1921, 1–15; Robinson\n2003a, 260–263; HCI 26–29). The letter strings, in other words, w ere already part of the\nsurahs when the Qur’an’s canonical surah order was determined. In fact, it is plausible to\ngo back even further: given that surah- initial letter strings are demonstrably correlated\nwith specific diction in the immediately following verses, as demonstrated above, there is\na strong presumption that the letter sequences are original components of their respec-\ntive surahs. This reasoning might be countered by positing that, perhaps, the addition of\nthe letter strings was conditioned by, and therefore secondary to, the presence of surah-\nopening statements involving the terms tanzīl or kitāb; but such a scenario, in which the\nletter sequences are efectively understood as serving to mark out surahs that open with\ninvocations of scripture, revelation, or recitation, leaves open the crucial question of what\nmight have motivated redactors to do so.\nThe letter sequences as repre sen ta tions of the Qur’an’s celestial archetype. The\nstrongest argument against abbreviationist construals of the letter sequences, what ever\ntheir specific inflection, is surely that they have a disquieting air of guesswork. This makes\nNöldeke’s revised view attractive that the isolated letters represent the Qur’anic revela-\ntions’ written celestial source or archetype (on which see in more detail under → kitāb).\nNöldeke’s revised opinion also fits well with the fact that many of the letter sequences\nare followed by statements employing the terms kitāb and tanzīl, at least if one accepts\ntwo subsidiary assumptions: first, that the demonstratives → dhālika or tilka that figure\nin some of the verses following letter sequences have an anaphoric significance and serve\nto refer back to the preceding letter string; and secondly, that the term kitāb in the surah\nintroductions at hand designates the heavenly scriptural archetype of which the Qur’anic\nproclamations are considered to form an oral exposition (see Sinai 2006, 117–126, and\nunder → kitāb). Accordingly, a statement like tilka āyātu l- kitābi l- mubīn, “ Those are the\nsigns of the clear scripture” (Q 28:2), refers back to the preceding letter sequence ṭ-s -m and\ndescribes it as representing the transcendent source document from which the Qur’anic\nrevelations are held to derive, namely, the celestial scripture with its constituent “sign-\npronouncements” (see in more detail under → dhālika).\nThe preceding theory is reinforced by the fact that the Qur’an asserts very explic itly\nthat the oral proclamations delivered by Muhammad are somehow based on, or form\nan exposition of, a heavenly scripture (see in more detail u nder → kitāb). Thus, a hand-\nful of passages (all Meccan and thus anterior to or at least cont emporary with the letter\nsequences) describe the Qur’anic texts as a “noble recitation” (qurʾān karīm; → qaraʾa)\ncontained “in a sheltered scripture” (fī kitābin maknūn; Q 56:77–78), as a “glorious recita-\ntion” that is stored “in a guarded tablet” (fī lawḥin maḥfūẓ; Q 85:21–22), as a “reminder”\ninhering “in honoured sheets” (fī ṣuḥufin mukarramah; Q 80:11.13),2 and as an “→ ʿarabī\n2 On Q 56:77–78, 80:11.13, and 85:21–22, see in more detail under → kitāb.\nʾ-l -r , ʾ-l - m, ʾ-l - m- r, ʾ-l - m-ṣ 57", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Despite forming an open- ended series of oral addresses, the\nQur’anic revelations are here presented as participating in the written nature of their ce-\nlestial source document (Sinai 2006, 112–116). One of the passages just cited also provides\na glimpse of how the heavenly archetype is considered to have been transformed into the\nQur’anic proclamations, namely, by an act of divine “sending- down” (tanzīl; Q 56:80), a\nconcept that reappears in twelve of the twenty- nine surah introductions cata logued in\nthe figure above, such as Q 3:3, 7:2, 12:2, 13:1, 32:2, or 40:2.3 We may thus assume that the\nterm kitāb as used in t hese surah introductions does indeed refer to a celestial archetype\nrather than to the body of the Qur’anic revelations themselves, even if the latter are also\ndescribed as forming a kitāb in their own right, one that is distinct from the kitāb revealed\nto Moses (e.g., Q 6:92.155, 46:12.30; see Sinai 2006, 129–133).\nNöldeke’s reconsidered position also coheres with two further features of the Qur’anic\nletter sequences. First, it has been observed the isolated letters include all basic undotted\nconsonantal forms of the early Arabic script, which lends support to the contention that\nthe disconnected letters symbolise the Arabic alphabet (Welch 1986, 414; Massey 2003,\n472–473; Stewart 2011, 339–341; Schmid, forthcoming b, ch. 3). Secondly, the succession\nof individual characters in the Qur’anic letter sequences adheres to a specific order that\naligns at least partially with the customary order of letters in the Arabic abjad (Massey\n1996, 498–499; Stewart 2011, 341–343). The inference that the letter sequences are meant to\nevoke the alphabet, or perhaps the technique of writing in general, is plausibly contextual-\nised by pointing to a wider late antique tendency to explore the cosmological significance\nand potency of the alphabet, an interest that can be detected both in Christian and rabbinic\ntexts (Schmid, forthcoming b, ch. 3). Within the Qur’an, though, the principal point of the\nletter sequences would appear to be specifically to represent the written mode of storage\n(see Madigan 2001, 69–77) that the Qur’anic proclamations associate with the heavenly\narchetype from which they claim to derive. As Devin Stewart writes, “the mysterious let-\nters are evidently intended to represent a distinctive or archaic alphabet associated with\na scripture that is closely tied to the Biblical tradition, exists on a super natural plane, and\nserves as the ultimate source for the revelations of the Qurʾān” (Stewart 2011, 341). Surah-\ninitial letter strings accordingly amount to an act of surrogate display: unlike the scriptural\ncodices and scrolls utilised and exhibited in Christian and Jewish ser vices, the Qur’anic\nproclamations’ celestial archetype is not empirically accessible; it cannot be pre- sented\nbut only re- presented; and the surah introductions u nder discussion h ere undertake to\nrepresent it in the shape of disconnected archigraphemic letter shapes.\nTo be sure, Nöldeke’s theory does not explain why some letter clusters are only found\nonce (e.g., y- s at the beginning of Surah 36) while o thers occur in several surahs (e.g., ʾ- l- m\nat the beginning of Surahs 2, 3, and 29–32), nor does it account for the fact that certain\nletter clusters are extensions of others (e.g., ʾ- l- m- r and ʾ- l- m-ṣ in comparison with ʾ- l- m).\nIt is pos si ble that the same or related letter clusters are correlated with pertinent further\n3 The pro cess leading from the celestial kitāb to the earthly qurʾān is also described by the term tafṣīl (e.g.,\nQ 41:3), roughly equivalent to an act of divine exposition or elucidation that adapts the contents of the celestial\nscripture to a specific audience of recipients (Sinai 2006, 120–126; see also u nder → faṣṣala). This casts doubt on\nGrimme’s claim that the Qur’anic revelations are an exact “transcript” (Abschrift) of the celestial book (Grimme\n1895, 72–73), even if this is how the relationship between the two entities is understood in the medieval com-\nmentary tradition (see the use of nasakha, “to copy,” in Ṭab. 20:546–547 = Q 43:4).\n58 ʾ-l - r, ʾ-l -m , ʾ-l -m - r, ʾ-l - m- ṣ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

A fter summarily covering God’s role\nas a creator and a moral judge, the entry argues in some detail that the Qur’an does not\nconceive of God as immaterial. This leads to a discussion of three anthropomorphic traits\nthat the Qur’an recurrently ascribes to God: a face, hands, and eyes. Although some of the\nrelevant formulations are clearly idiomatic, it is maintained that they cannot be reduced to\nmere meta phors. Rather, they serve to articulate essential aspects of divine personhood.\nEtymology and epigraphic attestation. The Kufan school of Arabic grammar considers\nallāh to be a contraction of al- ilāh, “the god” (e.g., al- Thaʿlabī 2015, 2:288), an etymology\nthat remains linguistically plausible (Kiltz 2012). Minimally, an understanding of allāh as\nequivalent to al-i lāh appears to have presented itself already to pre- Islamic speakers of\nArabic, seeing that poets like al-N ābighah al- Dhubyānī or the Christian ʿAdī ibn Zayd use\nthe two terms synonymously (e.g., DSAAP, al-N ābighah, no. 1:23–24; see GMK 110–111 and\nSinai 2019b, 7–9). Ancient North Arabian inscriptions, such as the corpus of Safaitic rock\ngraffiti, employ ʾlh or lh as the proper name of a pagan deity who is occasionally enumerated\ntogether with other gods, such as Kahl and ʿAththar or Ruḍā (e.g., Al- Jallad 2014a, 451; on\nepigraphic attestations in the region around Najrān, see now Robin 2020–2021, 86–90).1\nBilingual inscriptions in Arabic and Greek establish that at least when occurring as part of\ntheophoric names, ʾlh or lh were indeed pronounced allāh (Krone 1992, 58 and 461–463;\nAl- Jallad 2017a, 107, 132, 163, and 168). In Safaitic inscriptions, Allāh (ʾlh/lh) is petitioned\nfor rain, security, or booty, but there is no readily apparent functional specialisation that\nwould set him apart from other deities, some of whom—s uch as Ruḍā and Allāt— feature\nmore frequently. South Arabian inscriptions from Ḥimyar invoke both ʾln/ʾlhn (perhaps\npronounced ʾilān and ʾilāhān) and “the Merciful” (rḥmnn, raḥmānān) as the master of\nheaven and earth (Gajda 2009, 224–232; Robin and Rijziger 2018, 278–281). Identifiably\nChristian inscriptions, including one in mostly Arabic script from 548 or 549 CE and found\nnear Dūmah, show a preference for retaining the uncontracted form ʾl- ʾlh (al- ilāh) over\nthe contracted version ʾlh (e.g., Nehmé 2017, 124–131 and 153–154, and Robin 2020–2021,\n67 and 70–72; see also, for further references, Sinai 2019b, 7).\nAllāh in pre- Islamic poetry. A dif ere nt picture than that gleaned from Safaitic inscrip-\ntions emerges from pre-I slamic poetry, also composed by mostly pagan authors, where\nAllāh is invoked much more often than any other deity (Brockelmann 1922; Sinai 2019b,\n19–63). Poetry credits Allāh with a wide range of functions, including the creation of the\ncosmos and of h umans; control over the natur al world, especially the provision of rain;\ncontrol over the destiny of h uman individuals and collectives, a power often presented as\ninscrutable and ominous; omniscience; and the requital of moral infractions. There are\nalso a fair number of references to a cult of Allāh connected with the Meccan Kaʿbah. Al-\nthough the authenticity of individual lines of allegedly pre-I slamic poetry is often difficult\nto establish conclusively, the overall picture largely matches the beliefs about Allāh that the\nQur’an ascribes to Muhammad’s pagan opponents (on which see generally QP). The poetic\nevidence accordingly suggests that a pagan deity known as Allāh—an expression that pre-\nsumably originated from the reverential epithet al- ilāh, which may increasingly have come\nto be used like a proper name (Robin 2012, 305)—u nderwent a steep rise in the centuries\n1 For a much more detailed treatment of the attestation of allāh in Ancient North Arabian epigraphy and\npre- Islamic poetry, see Sinai 2019b, with additional primary and secondary references.\n60 allāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This development may be seen as a pro cess\nof discursive alignment with the theological koine of late antique culture, in which the idea\nof a supreme deity occupied a pivotal place (see generally Fowden 1993).\nHowever much the pre-I slamic pagan Allāh was endowed with aspects of the Biblical\nGod, at least one crucial disparity seems to have withstood this gradual pro cess of assimi-\nlation: in contrast to standard late antique Jewish and Christian belief, pagan adherents of\nAllāh did not conceive him as resurrecting the dead and sitting in eschatological judgement\nover them. To be sure, a small number of pre-I slamic verses faintly reflect the prevalence of\neschatological notions in late antique Christ iani ty and Judaism (Sinai 2019b, 45–46). Thus,\nʿAdī ibn Zayd—w ho by virtue of being a Christian would naturally have taken for granted\nthe idea of an eschatological judgement— alludes to “a day on which a servant [of God]\nwill not be treated ungratefully for what he has stored up” (yawma lā yukfaru ʿabdun mā\nddakhkhar; al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 8:17). But such eschatological ideas do not normally seem\nto have coloured the way in which non- Jewish and non- Christian inhabitants of Arabia\nconceived of Allāh. That the pagan understanding of Allāh generally lacked eschatologi-\ncal traits is also supported by the fact that the Qur’an pre sents its pagan or “associating”\n(→ ashraka) opponents as rejecting the resurrection or at least as being irredeemably\nunconcerned by it (QP 125–182). It is impor tant to emphasise that this does not entail\nthat the Qur’anic pagans lacked acquaintance with the idea of a final judgement. Rather,\nthey simply did not consider it plausible and are portrayed in the Qur’an as dismissing it\nas “ancient scribblings” (→ ˻asāṭīr al- awwalīn; see also under → ashraka).\nGod as creator. In attempting a synthesis of the Qur’an’s own understanding of Allāh—or\n“God,” as the Arabic word should normally be translated in the Qur’an2—t he obvious point\nto start is the claim that God is the “creator of all things” (khāliqu kulli shayʾin; Q 6:102, 13:16,\n39:62, 40:62, similarly 6:101 and 25:2). While the notion of Allāh’s creatorhood would not\nhave been novel to a pagan Arabian audience, the Qur’an’s pervasive emphasis on divine cre-\nation far outstrips the more peripheral occurrence of this theme in pre- Qur’anic poetry (see\nSinai 2019b, 27–28). As shown in more detail elsewhere (→ khalaqa), the Qur’an envisages\ndivine creation chiefly u nder the aspect of a bestowal of mea sure and proportion rather than\nunder that of creation ex nihilo, which had emerged as a prominent Christian doctrine by\nthe time of the Qur’an. From the Qur’anic vantage point, to say that God is the creator of all\nthings means, in the first place, that God has established and continues to uphold a cosmos\nmarked by wisdom and order rather than to vaunt God’s ability to bring forth something\nfrom nothing. Incidentally, the Qur’an’s lack of an unequivocal endorsement of creation\nex nihilo does not call into question the Qur’an’s commitment to a categorical distinction\nbetween God and the cosmos, for which latter the Qur’an employs the complex phrase “the\nheavens and the earth and what is between them” (see u nder → arḍ).\nRelated to this, the Qur’an does not confine God’s creatorhood to the primordial past\nbut frequently depicts it as an ongoing real ity. God continues to sustain the heavens and\nthe earth (Q 2:255) and holds them in place (Q 22:65 and 35:41), and he remains intimately\ninvolved with the way the natu ral world operates in the pre sent, to the manifest benefit\n2 It is however helpful to use “Allāh” rather than “God” when discussing the pagan belief in a pantheon of\ndif er ent deities, the supreme one of whom is picked out by the Arabic word allāh.\nallāh 61", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In fact, some passages cast God as being so enmeshed in\nthe world’s causal fabric that the Qur’anic understanding of nature, while consistently em-\nphasising its orderliness and anthropocentric functionality, at the same time comes close to\nbeing occasionalistic— which is to say that it exhibits a palpable tendency to attribute natu ral\npro cesses, like the falling of rain or the conception and maturation of h uman fetuses in the\nwomb, directly to God rather than to inner-w orldly c auses.3 Thus, the way in which the pro-\ncess of h uman conception and fetal development is summarised in passages like Q 23:12–14\nor 40:67 pre sents each developmental stage as directly engendered (khalaqa, jaʿala) by the\ndeity: God normally acts in a fixed and ordered sequence, but t here does not seem to be any\nimmanent causal relationship between one stage of the pro cess and the next.\nOne might object that the reason why the Qur’an places such emphasis on divine agency\nin this par tic u lar case is to do with the fact that the text is suggesting an inference from\nGod’s creation of humans in the here and now to his recreation of them at the future\nresurrection (see u nder → aḥyā and → khalaqa). Yet a similarly occasionalistic tendency\ncan be observed in other cases. For instance, when the shadow cast by an object becomes\nlonger or shorter over the course of the day, due to the changing elevation of the sun, it is\nreally God who stretches the shadow out and takes it away (Q 25:45–46).4 Even a fter having\nbeen fully set up, the natu ral realm is thus in no way causally in de pen dent of its creator,\nwhom Q 55:29 describes as incessantly busy (kulla yawmin huwa fī shaʾn, “everyday he is\nengaged in something”).5\n3 On occasionalism in the post- Qur’anic Islamic tradition and in Eu ro pean philosophy, see generally Perler\nand Rudolph 2000 and Rudolph 2016b. In the interest of further delineating the Qur’anic position on the issue\nat hand, it is helpful to note that al- Ghazālī, at least on Rudolph’s plausible interpretation, appears inclined to\nconcede that an occasionalistic view of the cosmos is one that would severely compromise God’s wisdom, in\nso far as it would strip the world of structure, coherence, and a significant degree of predictability (Perler and\nRudolph 2000, 94–96 and 104). The reason for this is that al- Ghazālī adopts from Avicenna the idea that the\nuniverse is “an integrated system of entities and events bound together in an interlocking order of causes and\nintermediaries” (Frank 1992b, 18). From the Qur’anic vantage point, by contrast, the assumption that God is\ndirectly and extensively implicated in the causal fabric of the most everyday pro cesses does not call into doubt\nthat the world, as factually run and directed by God, displays supreme wisdom. This is so because the Qur’an\ndoes not equate a cosmos exhibiting divine wisdom with a largely self- governing apparatus whose wise design\nmanifests itself precisely in the fact that it does not require constant divine micromanagement.\n4 The picture is complicated by other pro cessual descriptions in the Qur’an that do credit some stage of\nthe pro cess under consideration with at least an instrumental role in relation to a later stage or that invest some\nentity involved in the respective pro cess with its own causal efficacy. Thus, Q 7:57 says that God “sends the\nwinds” (yursilu l- riyāḥa), which carry (aqallat) rain clouds, which God then drives (suqnāhu) to dead land and\n“by means of” which he fi nally sends down (fa- anzalnā bihi) rain; other passages state that it is “by means of”\nrain (bihi) that God subsequently revivifies (→ aḥyā) the earth (Q 2:164, 16:65, 29:63, 30:24, 45:5; cf. 35:9). H ere,\nthe preposition bi- would seem to indicate that clouds and rain serve at least as partial causes of what happens\nsubsequently. The winds, moreover, are depicted as acting upon rain clouds (aqallat), which is also the case in\nQ 30:48 and 35:9, according to which God “sends the winds, which stir up clouds” (yursilu/arsala l- riyāḥa fa- tuthīru\nsaḥāban). But even so, Q 7:57 and 30:48 still pre sent God as the immediate cause of crucial developments in the\noverall pro cess of precipitation: God drives the rain clouds to a certain spot (Q 7:57) and he spreads the clouds\nout “as he wills” (Q 30:48: kayfa yashāʾu). Thus, at least at the literal level the Qur’an does not portray rainfall as\nan occurrence that is fully explicable by pointing to inner- cosmic occurrences, dispositions, or laws. For another\npassage implying that natur al entities have at least a l imited degree of causal efficacy, see Q 7:58, according to\nwhich the vegetation that grows in good soil “comes forth by the permission of its Lord” (yakhruju nabātuhū\nbi- idhni rabbihi). Here, a natu ral pro cess is reconciled with divine omnipotence in the same manner that other\nQur’anic passages apply to human agency (see under → shāʾa): God retains ultimate sovereignty in so far as he\ncould deny his permission and block the occurrence in question. See similarly Q 14:25.\n5 The surah’s rhyme suggests that the final word of the verse would have been pronounced shān.

It may be that this latter prerogative is one that is never g oing to be exercised\n(but see Josh 10:12–13). Yet it is clear that the Qur’anic God does on occasion employ\nhis total control over the cosmos in order to disrupt and redirect the ordinary course of\nnature in a miraculous manner. For instance, when Abraham’s idolatrous people tried to\nburn him alive, God commanded the fire to be “coolness and safety” for its prospective\nvictim (Q 21:68–69), thereby blocking its combustive efect (cf. with less detail Q 29:24\nand 37:97–98).7 Only human actions, it appears, do not directly come under the sway of\ndivine causality, even if they are nonetheless within the scope of God’s omnipotence in so\nfar as they could not proceed if God w ere to deny them permission (idhn; e.g., Q 10:100;\nsee in more detail under → shāʾa).8\nFrom the Qur’anic perspective, the existence of a munificent and omnipotent creator,\nto whom h umans owe gratitude and obedience, is evinced by sundry features of the natu ral\nworld, which the Qur’an calls “signs” (singular: → āyah). In this regard, the Islamic scripture\n6 Thus, Jacob stresses that any power possessed by a “nature” (kyānā)— e.g., any combustive power that\none might attribute to fire—w ould be exclusively due to the fact that the power in question was granted by God\n(māreh yab leh; Mathews 2018, 20–21, l. 1279) and that consequently “the Lord of natures (mārē kyānē) is the\nruler over His creation, and at His command every thing proceeds according to its activity” (Mathews 2018,\n22–23, ll. 1297–1298). While the Qur’an does not explic itly consider w hether the fact that fire usually burns t hings\nis to be explained by appealing to its immanent nature or powers, both Jacob and the Qur’an are concerned to\nstress that God can impede or redirect the ordinary course of events, and indeed Jacob goes so far as to say that\nfire itself “has no power (d- lā shallīṭ lāh) either to burn or to die down, for fire has always had a ruler and a Lord”\n(Mathews 2018, 22–23, ll. 1293–2294; cf. also Mathews 2018, 20–21, l. 1288: “for to burn or not to burn does not\nbelong to itself”). Hence, the position that Jacob adopts in this context has an occastionalistic tendency, similar\nto the Qur’anic passages discussed in the main text: in any given situation, God w ill e ither command fire to burn\nor not to burn; w hether combustion occurs or not is to be explained in terms of a divine command rather than\nin terms of any immanent disposition of fire. One should note, however, that elsewhere Jacob evinces a dif ere nt\nunderstanding of how God governs nature (Mathews 2018, 42–43, ll. 1483–1488). It is also pertinent to remark\nthat Jacob’s interest in safeguarding God’s ability to interfere with the combustive power of fire in par tic ul ar is\nclearly due to the fact that t here are scriptural miracles at stake for him— namely, the claim in Dan 3:19–30 that the\nthree men whom Nebuchadnezzar had thrown into a fiery furnace emerged unscathed and the claim in 1 Kgs 18:38\nthat the “fire of the Lord” that was summoned by Elijah in the context of his confrontation with the prophets of\nBaal consumed not only Elijah’s ofering but also “licked up” the w ater that Elijah had ordered to be poured over\nthe altar (Mathews 2018, 20–23, ll. 1285–1298). As explained further on in the main text, the Qur’an too reports a\nmiracle similar to Dan 3:19–30 (Q 21:68–69). The question w hether fire is combustive on account of its immanent\nnature was already debated by Hellenistic phi los o phers; see Perler and Rudolph 2000, 32–33.\n7 On the prehistory of this Qur’anic motif, see Kugel 1998, 252–254.\n8 The preceding exposition of the extent and limits of divine causality in the Qur’an is in broad agreement\nwith basic features of a generic and simplified version of classical (and non-B aghdādī) Muʿtazilī theology: rational\nagents are the only creatures endowed with a power of secondary causation or tawallud; every thing else— i.e.,\nall seemingly “natu ral” occurrences—is engendered by God (see Perler and Rudolph 2000, 44). To be sure, it is\narguable that certain strands of post- Qur’anic Islamic theology not only systematise but radicalise the Qur’anic\nunderstanding of God’s involvement in natur al pro cesses. Thus, al-A shʿarī taught that any change in the material\nworld whatsoever, including h uman actions and their efects, and even the mere per sis tence in being of any entity\nother than God required the deity’s constant intervention (Perler and Rudolph 2000, 51–56; Rudolph 2016b).\nBut at least the latter claim, which had already been championed by the Baghdādī Muʿtazilī Abū l- Qāsim al-K aʿbī\nal- Balkhī (Perler and Rudolph 2000, 46–51), is not alien to the Qur’an: according to Q 2:255, cited e arlier in the\nmain text, it is God who preserves the heavens and the earth.\nallāh 63", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Specifically, and as explained in more detail elsewhere\n(→ arḍ), the Qur’an tends to focus on the variegated ways in which the earth functions as\na hospitable habitat for its human residents— a line of reasoning that Averroes aptly terms\n“the argument from providence” (dalīl al- ʿināyah; Ibn Rushd 1964, 150 = Najjar 2001, 33).\nHowever, bearing in mind what was just said about God’s causal involvement in natu ral\npro cesses like the falling of rain, it is impor tant to add that when the Qur’an is drawing\nattention to God’s “signs” in the world, this is not merely to point out that the cosmos\nmust have been designed and produced by a uniquely wise and beneficent divine creator\nin the remote past; the Qur’an is also discerning the abiding and ubiquitous presence of\nthis creator beneath the familiar and seemingly unremarkable surface of common natu ral\nphenomena. Hence, Qur’anic āyāt, like the falling of rain and the resulting revivification\nof parched land, are signs of a mediated kind of divine presence in the world rather than\njust signs of divine origination of the world (Frank 1992a, 23, n. 29).\nThe general movement of thought from the cosmos to a transcendent creator and\nman ag er thereof that the Qur’an seeks to elicit is dramatised in a scene from the life of the\nparadigmatic mono thei st Abraham, which is recounted in Q 6:75–79 and builds on earlier\ntraditions about Abraham’s proficiency in astronomy (Kugel 1998, 249–251). The passage\ndepicts how Abraham, after having surveyed “the kingdom (malakūt; → malik) of the\nheavens and the earth” (Q 6:75), successively pays religious homage to a star, the moon,\nand the sun by acclaiming each one with the words, “This is my Lord” (Q 6:76–78: hādhā\nrabbī). Yet in each case, the heavenly body in question sets or vanishes from sight (afala/\nafalat; cf. AEL 70). Thus, the periodic occultation of all celestial bodies, which were of\ncourse established objects of religious veneration in the ancient world, causes Abraham\nto realise that even the most power ful entities in the world are finite beings that cannot\ntherefore be identical with the world’s supreme sovereign. Abraham consequently arrives\nat the insight that the being truly deserving of human worship must completely transcend\nthe cosmos and must consist in the one “who created the heavens and the earth” (Q 6:79:\nalladhī faṭara l-s amāwāti wa-l -a rḍa).9 The scene exemplifies in a particularly vivid manner\nhow the Qur’an, like other descendants of the Biblical tradition, locates divinity beyond\nrather than within the world,10 however much the latter bears witness to God’s miraculous\nactivity.\nThe Qur’an maintains not only that the cosmos must have been brought forth and con-\ntinue to be directed by a wise deity transcending it; it also rules out that t here could be\nmore than one such deity. This latter claim becomes explicit only from a certain point in the\nQur’an’s early Meccan period; but the uncompromising mono thei sm that results quickly\nasserts itself as one of the main Qur’anic doctrines, leading to vigorous polemics against\nthe view held by the Qur’an’s “associating” opponents that t here w ere other deities besides\nAllāh (see u nder → ashraka).

According to\nQ 23:91, if there w ere several gods, “each god would make of with what he created” (la-\ndhahaba kullu ilāhin bi- mā khalaqa) and t here would be strife and conflict between them\n(see also Q 17:42). Similarly, Q 21:22 explains that the existence of deities other than God\nwould cause heaven and earth to “go to ruin” (la- fasadatā; see under → afsada), presumably\nbecause the world would end up being a battlefield of conflicting divine forces rather than\na well- designed and smoothly interlocking system.11 The counterfactual line of reasoning\nintimated h ere aspires to show that the hypothesis of a plurality of deities is incompatible\nwith the factual orderliness and unity of the world (see also Mir 1987, 11, and Gwynne 2004,\n176). Yet the argument w ill hardly have impressed Muhammad’s pagan adversaries, who\nsubscribed to a hierarchical conception of the divine that intercalated vario us intermedi-\nary deities between Allāh and the h uman sphere (→ ashraka). To an argument of the sort\nput forward in Q 23:91, the Qur’anic associators could simply have responded that Allāh’s\nunquestionable supremacy over all other divine beings was sufficient to ensure cosmic or-\nderliness and a clear chain of command. Why indeed should a divine hierarchy comprising\ndif ere nt levels of power and authority necessarily engender chaos and strife? Provided that\nany gods and goddesses other than Allāh are deemed subordinate to him, why would they\nnecessarily “seek a path to the incumbent of the throne” (Q 17:42: la- btaghaw ilā dhī l-ʿ arshi\nsabīlā)—t hat is, seek to displace him—or be bound to overpower one another (Q 23:91:\nla-ʿ alā baʿḍuhum ʿalā baʿḍin)?\nThe reason why the Qur’an fails to countenance the possibility of a pantheon that is\nstructured hierarchically, and therefore stable and compatible with an orderly and unitary\ncosmos, resides in a basic conceptual disagreement between the Qur’an and its pagan\nopponents, a disagreement that is astutely pinpointed by Crone: the Qur’anic Messenger\n“saw a stark contrast between God and every thing else whereas the pagans saw divinity\nas a spectrum” (QP 61). The Qur’an, in other words, does not consider divinity, or the\nquality of being divine, to admit of gradation or degrees (unlike, say, colours), meaning\nthat any being subordinate to Allāh must eo ipso be non- divine: only a being who sits\nat the very top of the cosmic hierarchy merits being classed as divine. For instance, an-\ngels, though acknowledged by the Qur’an to be super natural beings with extraordinary\npowers, are not subsidiary gods but rather, as Q 43:19 insists, servants of the one God (see\nin more detail under → malak). God is categorically without equal (Q 112:4) or “associ-\nates” (shurakāʾ, singular: sharīk; e.g., Q 6:22.94.100.136 e tc.).12 A diametrical opposition\nbetween God and all other entities also resonates in verses that underscore God’s tremen-\ndous and singular majesty (e.g., Q 59:23–24 and 45:36–37), his utter self- sufficiency and\nnon- dependency on anything e lse (e.g., Q 2:263.267, 3:97, 6:133), his omnipotence (see\nunder → qadīr, → shāʾa), and his omniscience (e.g., Q 2:29.231.282, 4:32.176, 5:97, 6:101,\n42:12). God’s uniqueness is furthermore expressed by saying that he is “the first and the\n11 The Qur’anic train of thought here bears a certain resemblance to what William Wainright, in his overview\nof philosophical arguments for mono thei sm, calls the “argument from causal order”— namely, the argument that\n“the unity of the world, the fact that it exhibits a uniform structure, that it is a single cosmos, strongly suggests\nsome sort of unity in its cause” (Wainwright 2018, section 4.1). But as Wainwright notes, quoting William Paley,\nthe argument in fact “proves only ‘a unity of counsel’ or (if there are subordinate agents) ‘a presiding’ or ‘con-\ntrolling will.’ ” This is precisely why the argument does not properly refute the belief that there exists a hierarchy\nof subordinate deities with Allāh at the top, as explained in what follows in the main text.\n12 On Q 112:4, and in par tic u lar on the word kufuʾ/kufuw, see in more detail below.

From this vantage point, the possibility that there\nmight exist beings that are divine yet nonetheless subordinate to Allāh, and thus not apt\nto disrupt his ultimate supremacy, is not so much eliminated on the basis of an argument\nas ruled out on definitional grounds.\nWhy does the Qur’an take for granted such a stark dualism of God and every thing e lse?\nThe reason would seem to be the essential role that the Qur’anic conception of divinity\naccords to creatorhood. “Is someone who creates like someone who does not create?” (a-fa\nman yakhluqu ka-m an lā yakhluqu), Q 16:17 asks, highlighting what the Qur’an takes to be\nthe key trait of God (see also Q 35:3.40 and 46:4). Other verses imply that lack of creative\nability equates to being created (Q 7:191, 16:20, 25:3), thus precluding the existence of\nintermediary beings who are distinct from the one creator yet are nonetheless not simply\ncreatures of his like humans. While the Qur’an’s pagan opponents were well acquainted\nwith the idea that one par tic u lar god, Allāh, played the role of a cosmic creator, they did\nnot elevate creatorhood into the essential definitional ingredient of divinity. The Qur’an,\nby contrast, assumes precisely that: to posit the existence of gods who lack creatorhood is\nefectively considered conceptually inconsistent (QP 60). Indeed, the extent to which the\nQur’an treats the notions of divinity and creatorhood as equivalent is well illustrated by the\npar tic ul ar manner in which the counterfactual claim in Q 23:91, cited above, is formulated:\nif there were more than one deity, the verse argues, each one would “make of with what\nhe created”— that is, if the deities whose existence is h ere refuted are to count as deities at\nall, they must be considered creators of something.\nGod as judge. Unlike miscellaneous places in the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Deut 1:31, 8:5, 14:1;\nIsa 43:6, 63:16, 64:7) and even more so in the New Testament (e.g., Matt 5:16.45.48, 6:1.4.6\netc.), the Qur’an does not explic itly call God a “f ather” (see also u nder → ab). Indeed, a\nMedinan verse, Q 5:18, explic itly rebufs the Jews and Christians for styling themselves as\nGod’s “ children and beloved ones” (naḥnu abnāʾu llāhi wa- aḥibbāʾuhu), an allegation that\naptly captures certain facets of Jewish and Christian self- descriptions.13 As the immediately\nfollowing segment of Q 5:18 makes clear, the rationale under lying the Qur’an’s criticism\nof envisaging God as a paternal figure is that this would be incompatible with a second\ncrucial aspect of the Qur’anic understanding of God besides his creatorhood, namely, God’s\nrole as an equitable moral judge: “Why, then, does he punish youp for your sins? No, you\nare human beings, belonging to his creatures (bal antum basharun mimman khalaqa); he\nforgives whom he wills and punishes whom he w ills.” God’s readiness to hold h umans to\naccount, the Qur’an insists, is not constrained by any sort of quasi- parental favouritism\nvis-à -v is some h umans as opposed to others.14 The Qur’anic God, then, is not only a creator;\n13 Thus, m. Abot 3:14 notes that Israel are especially “beloved” because Deut 14:1 calls them “sons” or\n“ children” of God. For repeated references to the Israelites as a “beloved p eople” in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic\npoetry, see Sokolof and Yahalom 1999, 158, 168, 172, 174, 186 = nos 21:1–2, 25:2, 26:29.47, 30:6. On the Christian\nside, one might adduce 1 John 3:1–2 (“See what love the Father has given us, that we should be called children\nof God, tekna theou; and that is what we are . . .”) or Rom 8:14–17 (huioi theou, tekna theou). See also Zellentin\n2016, 266, who cites a passage from the Didascalia Apostolorum in which the community is addressed as “God’s\nservants and children” (Vööbus 1979, 14, l. 15). The claim that a certain collective is as such “beloved” by God\nclashes with the Qur’anic assumption that God’s love for humans is commensurate with the latter’s moral merit\n(see further below and under → al- raḥmān).\n14 This reading of Q 5:18 is corroborated by the Qur’an’s repeated critique that Jews and Christians are\nguilty of spurious eschatological optimism and complacency (see Q 2:80.94.111.135, 3:24, 62:6).

Thus, he is often\ncalled “merciful” (raḥīm) or “the Merciful” (→ al- raḥmān) and is credited with love (e.g.,\nQ 2:195.222, 3:31.76.134.146.148.159, 5:13.42.54.93, in all of which God is the subject of\naḥabba, “to love”; see u nder → al- raḥmān) and readiness to forgive (e.g., Q 2:173.182.192\netc., 3:31.89.129 e tc., 53:32). Conversely, the Qur’an also attributes to God wrath (e.g., Q\n2:61, 3:112, 4:93, 5:60; → ghaḍiba) and the exacting of retribution (see Q 3:4, 5:95, 14:47,\n39:37, all of which describe God as ʿazīzun dhū ntiqām, “mighty and exacting retribution”;\nsee also the use of intaqama min, “to exact retribution from,” in 5:95, 7:136, 15:79, 30:47,\n32:22, 43:25.41.55, 44:16). God is even said to be engaged in cunning scheming (→ makara).\nHowever, a strong case can be made that all of the emotional stances just mentioned are\nconditional upon, and proportionate to, the moral merits or demerits of humans, including\nQ 2:124, according to which God’s covenant with Abraham does not encompass those of his descendants who are\n“wrongdoers” (cf. also 2:134.141). The general concern emerging from all t hese passages is to stress that salvation\nis contingent on individual merit rather than communal belonging or genealogical descent; and Q 5:18 seems to\nreflect the understanding that applying paternal language to God is apt to dilute the eschatological individualism\nto which the Qur’an is so committed.\n15 One may won der how Q 5:18 relates to statements that God has “favoured” the Israelites “over the\nworld- dwellers” (Q 2:47.122, 7:140, 45:16: faḍḍaltukum/faḍḍalakum/faḍḍalnāhum ʿalā l- ʿālamīn). As explained\nunder → darajah, this means only that God has bestowed manifold blessings on the Israelites, thereby putting\nthem u nder the obligation to be appropriately grateful; it does not entail that God deems the Israelites to be more\ndeserving of his blessings than o thers nor that he is more likely to overlook their sins than those of other h umans.\nallāh 67", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Indeed, the assumption that God’s responses to h umans,\ndespite having an unmistakable emotional dimension, are meticulously calibrated in ac-\ncordance with human deserts is rhetorically foregrounded by statements like “they have\nforgotten (verb: nasiya) God, so he has forgotten them” (Q 9:67)—t hat is, by statements\npredicating one and the same verb first of humans and subsequently of God, by way of a\nresponse in kind (→ nasiya, → makara, → tāba). Human righ teousness and sin have an\nemotional resonance in God, but this does not, from the Qur’anic vantage point, call into\ndoubt the assertion that God is “the best of all judges” (Q 7:87, 10:109, 11:45, 12:80, 95:8).\nBearing in mind both God’s ongoing creative activity as well as his intimate involvement\nin h uman afairs, the Qur’anic God could aptly be characterised in the same words with\nwhich Richard Frank has captured the general understanding of God in pre- Ghazālian\nIslamic theology or kalām: God is “viewed as essentially an agent: an agent who acts and\nwhose activity is directed outside Himself, not in the contemplation and knowing of Him-\nself” (Frank 1971, 18). Frank’s statement involves an implicit contrast with the Aristotelian\nnotion of the divine first cause as being absorbed in self- contemplation, as “thought thinking\nitself” (noēsis noēseōs; see Metaphysics 1072b and 1074b). The scriptural material surveyed so\nfar hardly gives rise to any sort of temptation to proje ct Aristotelian theology on the Qur’an.\nYet as we s hall see in the next section, it is not entirely trivial to insist that the Qur’anic\nconcept of God must not unwittingly be viewed through the prism of certain Greek ideas\nabout the divine that came to enjoy considerable popularity in all three Abrahamic religions\nand arguably still govern the interpretive reflexes of Qur’anic scholars.\nIs the Qur’anic God invisible and immaterial? The Qur’anic tendency to stress God’s\nsingular grandeur and to set him apart from all other beings and from the cosmos (i.e.,\n“the heavens and the earth”) at large finds its most explicit expression in the statement that\n“nothing is like” God (laysa ka- mithlihi shayʾun) in Q 42:11. Together with the assertion\nthat “the eyes do not attain him, but he attains the eyes” (lā tudrikuhu l- abṣāru wa- huwa\nyudriku l-a bṣāra; Q 6:103), this seemingly absolute exclusion of any similarity between\nGod and other t hings can easily invite Platonising construals of the Qur’anic deity as being\nontologically dif er ent from his creatures, as dwelling in a domain of being that is separate\nfrom that of material objects, making God intrinsically invisible and immaterial. In the\nIslamic tradition, an early explicit formulation of the view that God is an immaterial entity\ngoes back to Jahm ibn Ṣafwān (d. 745–746), who reportedly identified God as “that which\nis other than bodies” (ghayr al- jism; al-A shʿarī 1963, 346, l. 7; see Schöck 2016, 62). From an\ninner- Qur’anic perspective, however, it is unwarranted to understand God as immaterial\nand invisible. At least three considerations may be marshalled in support of this.\nFirst, the Qur’an has no vocabulary to articulate a Platonic bifurcation of real ity into two\nspheres, a material or corporeal and an immaterial or spiritual one; the contrast between\n“the hidden” (al-g hayb) and “the observable” (al-s hahādah), which might be deemed\nto articulate such a distinction, is squarely epistemological rather than ontological (see\nunder → al-g hayb). Secondly, God is said to have established himself on the throne, or\nliterally to have “sat down straight” upon it, istawā (e.g., Q 7:54, 10:3; see O’Shaughnessy\n1973, 208–214).16 That the divine throne is materially real rather than a mere meta phor is\n16 For other instances of the verb istawā, “to stand up or sit up straight” (+ ilā: “to straighten o.s. up\ntowards”; + ʿalā: “to sit down on”; see CDKA 142), as applied to God, see Q 2:29, 13:2, 20:5, 25:59, 32:4, 41:11,\n68 allāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

According to Q 2:210, moreover, on the day of judgement God and the angels\nwill “come to” the h umans awaiting judgement “in overshadowing clouds” (cf. also 89:22),\nwhich on the face of it entails that the deity is capable of spatial displacement, however\nmuch some medieval commentators laboured to preclude such an understanding (Ayoub\n1984, 211–215). The net implication is very much that the Qur’an considers God to occupy\na par tic u lar spatial position to the exclusion of others, even if Q 2:115 emphasises that\n“wherever you turn, t here is the face of God” (fa- aynamā tuwallū fa-t hamma wajhu llāhi).17\nThirdly, two early Qur’anic passages, if understood according to their most straightforward\nsense, promise that the blessed w ill see God in paradise (Q 75:22–23: “ There will be f aces\non that day that are radiant, // gazing upon their Lord,” ilā rabbihā nāẓirah) and credit the\nQur’anic Messenger with a theophanic experience (Q 53:5–18, on which see Bell 1934; for\nan overview of further secondary lit er a ture, both premodern and modern, see Williams\n2008, 106–110).18 There is no indication that talk of visually perceiving God must be con-\nstrued in anything other than its literal sense.\nThe obvious reading of the material just surveyed is that the Qur’an considers God to be\nat least in princip le vis ib le and to be spatially located. The Qur’anic God cannot, therefore,\nbe immaterial in any strict sense.19 Against this, one could demur that a Christian author\nlike Ephrem also posits a beatific vision of God in paradise, from which it would be rash\nto infer that he deems God to be material (see in more detail under → jannah). However,\nEphrem signals clearly enough that portrayals of paradise in this-w orldly or corporeal\nterms must not be interpreted literally, whereas the Qur’an is devoid of similarly explicit\ncaveats about understanding its language according to its plain meaning. There is, ac-\ncordingly, far more reason to take the Qur’anic statements presented earlier at face value.\nTo be sure, it remains debatable w hether this equates to the positive doctrine that God\nis a body, since the Qur’an does not have an abstract concept of physical bodies defined\nas entities that are composed of m atter (of what ever kind) and positioned in space: all\nof the three Qur’anic terms that correspond to the En glish word “body”— namely, jasad\n(Q 7:148, 20:88, 21:8, 38:34),20 badan (Q 10:92), and jism (Q 2:247 and 63:4)—a ppear to\n53:6 (perhaps the earliest occurrence), and 57:4. Speyer maintains that the frequent Qur’anic affirmation that after\ncreating the world God “sat down on the throne” (Q 13:2, 25:59, 32:4, 57:4: istawā ʿalā l- ʿarshi, inverted in 20:5)\nhas rabbinic parallels (BEQ 24), although the precise date and provenance of the material merits re- examination.\nFor further comments on istawā, see below and also under → khalaqa.\n17 The understanding that God is positioned in space also accords with assertions that some of the blessed\nin paradise will be positioned “close” to God (muqarrabūn; see Q 3:45, 56:11.88, 83:21.28, and also 54:54–55).\nOne could choose to interpret this par tic u lar term meta phor ically, but a literal reading fits well with other\nscriptural data.\n18 Kinberg 2004, 17, notes that further, albeit indirect, evidence for a paradisiacal theophany may be found\nin Q 83:15, according to which those who will roast in hell for rejecting God’s signs will be “veiled” or “separated\nby a screen” from their Lord (kallā innahum ʿan rabbihim yawmaʾidhin la- maḥjūbūn).\n19 A potential objection would consist in pointing out that the Qur’an presupposes that angels do not ingest\nfood and to underline that this trait was traditionally understood to be linked to their immateriality; but it is not\nclear that the same reasoning may be imputed to the Qur’an (see under → malak).\n20 In the Qur’an, the word jasad would seem to be deployed specifically in contexts in which reference is\nto lifelike apparitions or repre sen ta tions of human or animal bodies that lack full biological functioning. For\ninstance, according to Q 21:8 God did not make previous messengers “a jasad, not eating food, and they did not\nremain forever,” wa- mā jaʿalnāhum jasadan lā yaʾkulūna l-ṭ aʿāma wa- mā kānū khālidīn. Most likely, this responds\nto the expectation on the part of Muhammad’s opponents that a divine messenger would not be a mere human\nbut a super natural, angelic figure (see, e.g., Q 25:7.20, 23:33); and angels, according to the Qur’an, do not eat\n(see under → malak).

Moreover, there is no suggestion that any\nof them might be applicable to the deity. Thus, the Qur’an itself does not place God and\ncreated beings within an overarching ontological class of material bodies, or indeed under\nany other joint rubric. Rather, as we saw above, the Qur’an assumes a consistent dualism\nof creator and created. But in so far as the properties of being vis i ble and being spatially\nlocated do seem to be common to both God and his creatures, the Qur’anic portrayal of\nGod is indeed that of an embodied being.\nHow is all of this to be reconciled with the verses quoted above that seem to suggest\ndivine invisibility or immateriality? There is little difficulty in construing Q 6:103 (“the\neyes do not attain him, but he attains the eyes”) in a sense that is compatible with God’s\ngeneral visibility, as indeed the verse was read by many premodern Sunnī scholars (Wil-\nliams 2008, 83–85). For example, one might understand Q 6:103 to declare that God is not\ncomprehensively and exhaustively vis i ble (Williams 2008, 84). A reading that does not take\nQ 6:103 to assert invisibility in princi ple is also consistent with Q 7:143, which reports how\nMoses, having been “spoken to” by God, demands to be permitted to see God (“My Lord,\nlet me gaze upon you,” rabbi arinī anẓur ilayka). God rebuts this request, however: “You\nwill not see me (lan tarānī). But look upon this mountain; if it remains firm in its place,\nyou w ill see me.” God then “manifests himself” (tajallā) to the mountain, flattening it and\nstriking Moses to the ground. As persuasively argued by W. Wesley Williams, this account\ndoes not depict God as being inherently invisible but rather illustrates the overpowering\nand potentially lethal nature of an unmitigated theophany, which cannot even be endured\nby a mountain (Williams 2008, 88–99; Williams 2009, 38). The same point is conveyed by\nQ 7:143’s Biblical precursor, Exod 33:18–23 (BEQ 341–342), which “does not claim that God\nhas no body for us to see; the point is rather that seeing God’s body will lead immediately\nto death” (Sommer 2009, 3).21\nAs regards the statement that “nothing is like” God in Q 42:11, van Ess has appropriately\nhighlighted that the verse does not actually “decide the question w hether the dissimilar-\nity between God and man was absolute or relative” (van Ess 2018, 610; see also Williams\n2009, 33–36, inter alia pointing to the comparable contention in Isa 40:18: “To whom then\nwill you liken God, or what likeness compare with him?”). For instance, the early exegete\nMuqātil ibn Sulaymān glosses the “nothing is like him” statement in Q 42:11 by succinctly\nadding “in power” (fī l- qudrah), thus specifying that God’s diference from other beings\nis to be understood in a fairly specific manner rather than as total alterity (Muqātil 2002,\n3:765). Contextually, this makes good sense, in so far as Q 42:11 opens by declaring that\nGod is the creator of the heavens and the earth; the point of the “nothing is like him”\nstatement may accordingly be simply that God is unlike anything else in so far as he is the\ncreator of every thing else, not that he has an ontological constitution that is absolutely\nʿijlan jasadan lahu khuwārun, see Pregill 2020, 323–327, who glosses the phrase as signifying “a statue (or image)\nof a lowing calf” (citing p. 327). On Q 38:34, according to which God “cast a jasad” on Solomon’s throne, see\nBEQ 399–401. In poetry, jasad can designate the blood of sacrificial animals (DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 5:37);\nbut a line from the poetic corpus of ʿAbīd ibn al-A braṣ (Lyall 1913, ʿAbīd, no. 24:21) employs the plural ajsād\nspecifically to refer to lifeless bodies (Lyall translates “corpses”), said to be “ under the earth.” See on this verse\nSeidensticker 1989, 153.\n21 Cf. also Edmond Cherbonnier’s statement that the Biblical God “is invisible simply as a m atter of tactics.\nDe facto, men seldom do see Him. Upon occasion, however, he does show himself” (Cherbonnier 1962, 199).\n70 allāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim reading kufuw here is a variant of kufuʾ or kufʾ, also attested as\nvariant readings (MQ 10:639–642, and MQQ 8:272–273; cf. van Putten 2022, 177), a word\nthat means “of equal rank” (Ullmann 1970, 253–254; CDKA 239). Q 112:4 thus stresses\nthe diference between God and all other entities without implying radical ontological\nalterity, which in turn corroborates a weaker interpretation of Q 42:11 than that to which\ncon temporary readers are perhaps instinctively attracted. Such a weaker reading of the\n“nothing is like him” formulation in Q 42:11, fi nally, has the virtue of not generating a con-\ntradiction with the patently anthropomorphic predication following it, namely, that God\nis “the hearing and the seeing” (wa- huwa l- samīʿu l- baṣīr). Although Ibn ʿArabī, for one,\ndelights in the verse’s apparently paradoxical juxtaposition of divine “incomparability”\n(tanzīh) and “similarity” (tashbīh; see, e.g., Chittick 1989, 73–74, 111, 112), a good case can\nbe made that the Qur’an’s original recipients, like other early Muslims such as Muqātil,\nwould not have understood Q 42:11 to enunciate a paradox at all.\nGod as luminous. The Qur’an envisages its embodied deity as luminous, a notion that\nhas a long ancient Near Eastern, including Biblical, pedigree (Williams 2008, 89–90; Wil-\nliams 2009, 38–39). Thus, the verb tajallā, which describes God’s visual manifestation in\nQ 7:143, in addition to carry ing the meaning of self- revelation,23 also connotes splendour\nand radiance, as shown by Q 92:2 (wa- l- nahāri idhā tajallā, perhaps “By the day when it\ndawns in splendour”). Th ere is also Q 39:69, a Meccan verse according to which the earth\n“ will be resplendent with the light of its Lord” (wa- ashraqati l- arḍu bi- nūri rabbihā) on the\nday of judgement. To be sure, there are verses mentioning God in connection with light\nin which the latter is to be construed as a mere meta phor of divine guidance: the Qur’an\ncondemns those who would “extinguish God’s light with their mouths” (Q 9:32, 61:8:\nyurīdūna li- yuṭfiʾū / an yuṭfiʾū nūra llāhi bi- afwāhihim); it repeatedly declares that God and\nhis messengers seek to “bring” p eople “out” (akhraja) “from the darkness into the light”\n(mina l- ẓulumāti ilā l- nūri; Q 2:257, 5:16, 14:1.5, 33:43, 57:9, 65:11);24 and it maintains that\nboth the Torah (→ al-t awrāh) and the Gospel (→ al-i njīl) contain “guidance and light”\n(Q 5:44.46; see also 6:91). Nonetheless, with regard to Q 39:69 it seems more likely that\nthe verse speaks of literal light, given that the same context also mentions the blowing\nof the eschatological trumpet (v. 68) and the display of the celestial register of deeds in\npreparation for the judgement (v. 69). But if reference is to concrete light rather than to\nthe meta phorical light of divine guidance, then it stands to reason that this is light emitted\nby God, who arrives in order to judge humans and other moral agents. Fi nally, there is the\n22 See also al-A shʿarī 1963, 152, l. 15–153, l. 3, and 209, ll. 7–9 (on which see van Ess 1991–1997, 5:224, and\nWilliams 2009, 35): Muqātil ibn Sulaymān reportedly held both that God was a body (jism) with a h uman form\n(ʿalā ṣūrat al- insān) and that he “does not resemble anything e lse, and nothing else resembles him” (lā yushbihu\nghayrahu wa- lā yushbihuhu), an assertion that approximates the “nothing is like him” formulation from Q 42:11.\nAlthough one cannot assume that al- Ashʿarī’s testimony is fully and verbally accurate (see Sirry 2012), it does\nsuggest that at least some early Muslims did not see any contradiction in subscribing sim ult a neously to divine\nanthropomorphism and to divine alterity or transcendence. It may be suggested that this archaic view is closer\nto that of the Qur’an than the immaterialism that came to dominate later kalām.\n23 See the use of the second form jallā in the sense of “to make manifest” in Q 7:187 (see also 91:3), corre-\nsponding to Syriac gallī, “to reveal, to uncover,” which suggests that tajallā, too, might be parallelised with Syriac\netglī or etgallī, “to be revealed.” See FVQ 91; on the Syriac verbs, see SL 235–236.\n24 Cf. 1 Pet 2:9, describing God as the one “who called you out of darkness into his marvellous light.”\nallāh 71", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is noteworthy that the Bible, too,\ndoes not invariably portray God as dangerously luminous; for example, according to Exod\n33:11, “God spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend” (see the sel ection\nof references in Sommer 2009, 3–4).\nAnthropomorphic traits of the Qur’anic deity: God’s face, hands, and eyes. Apart\nfrom hinting at God’s luminosity, the Qur’an portrays God as humanoid, in so far as vari-\nous verses speak of his face, hands, eyes, or attribute visual and aural percipience to him.\nBefore developing the point, it must be acknowledged that many of the relevant passages\nclearly have an idiomatic and figurative purport. Thus, Baljon has convincingly argued that\nQur’anic references to “seeking” or “wanting” (ibtaghā) the “face” (wajh) of God (Q 2:272,\n13:22, 92:20; cf. also 6:52, 18:28, 30:38–39, 76:9) are largely synonymous with the parallel\nphrases “seeking God’s satisfaction” (Q 57:27: ibtighāʾa riḍwāni llāhi), “seeking mercy from\nyour Lord” (Q 17:28: ibtighāʾa raḥmatin min rabbika), and “seeking God’s satisfaction”\n(Q 2:207.265: ibtighāʾa marḍāti llāhi; see Baljon 1988, 125–126). God’s hand, too, is in most\ncases invoked in an evidently idiomatic fashion, as in Q 3:73 (inna l- faḍla bi-y adi llāhi, lit-\nerally: “favour is in the hand of God”; similarly 57:29) or 48:10 (ya du llāhi fawqa aydīhim,\n“God’s hand is above their hands,” meaning, prob ably, that God acts as a guarantor of\noaths of allegiance sworn to Muhammad).26 That we are confronted by idiomatic language\nis particularly evident with regard to Q 5:64, which condemns “the Jews” for saying that\n“God’s hand is fettered” (ya du llāhi maghlūlatun), thereby employing a meta phor for nig-\ngardliness that is elsewhere applied to humans (Q 17:29: wa- lā tajʿal yadaka maghlūlatan\nilā ʿunuqika, “DoS not let your hand be fettered to your neck”; Baljon 1988, 124–125; see also\nunder → al- yahūd).27 God’s eye or eyes, fin ally, are only referenced in the formulaic prep-\n25 Q 24:35 explic itly styles itself as a mathal, or similitude: “A similitude for his light is that it is like a niche in\nwhich t here is a lamp . . .” Does this entail that Q 24:35’s description of God as light is to be read figuratively? No,\nsince what the verse claims is that it provides a mathal for God’s light, not that describing God as light is itself a\nmathal. The view that the deity is a luminous body continued to resonate among early post- Qur’anic theologians,\nsuch as Hishām ibn al-Ḥ akam (al-A shʿarī 1963, 31–32). But however archaic his views w ere bound to appear from the\nperspective of later theologians, beholden to a more Hellenised understanding of God as immaterial, Hishām ibn al-\nḤakam seems to have denied that God’s body had a humanoid shape and to have attributed to him the same length,\nwidth, and depth, perhaps to highlight the “absolute perfection” of God’s form (van Ess 2017–2020, 1:422–423).\nHishām ibn al-Ḥ akam is thus already one step removed from the Qur’anic conception of God as a luminous body\nwho is also humanoid (see further below in the main text). On the other hand, some post- Qur’anic traditions go\nmuch further than the Qur’an in their anthropomorphism, by describing how God appeared to Muhammad in his\nsleep as “a young man with long hair” (Williams 2009, 41–43; van Ess 2017–2020, 4:425–427).\n26 See also Q 3:26 (bi- yadika l- khayru, “in your hand is what is good”), 23:88 and 36:83 (man/alladhī bi-y adihi\nmalakūtu kulli shayʾin, “in whose hand is the kingship over every thing”), and 67:1 (alladhī bi-y adihi l-m ulku, “in\nwhose hand is the kingship”).\n27 Equally idiomatic is the reference to God’s side (janb) in Q 39:56: an taqūla nafsun yā-ḥ asratā ʿalā mā\nfarraṭtu fī janbi llāhi (“lest any soul should say, ‘Alas for me, in that I was remiss regarding God’ ”). And pace\nBöwering 2002, 323, Q 68:42 (yawma yukshafu ʿan sāqin, “on the day on which the leg will be bared”) does not\nexpressly refer to God but simply describes the onset of the final judgement by invoking the act of readying oneself\nfor a run or for battle. “On the day on which t hings come to a head” would be a perfectly adequate rendering.\nSee also the treatment of this verse in al- Farāhī 2002, 234–235.\n72 allāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

After all, the fact that the Qur’an can meta phor ically speak of a human guardian\nas the one “in whose hand resides the authority to tie a marriage” (alladhī bi-y adihi ʿuq-\ndatu l-n ikāḥi; Q 2:237) does not entail that the person in question lacks a physical hand.\nRather, the meta phorical usage builds on an anatomical fact. This is also supported by\ntwo Qur’anic verses whose literal sense implies that divine creation may have a manual\ndimension, even if figurative interpretations of them are by no means uncommon in the\npremodern exegetical tradition. There is, first, Q 36:71, where the divine voice subsumes\nlivestock under “our handi work” (mimmā ʿamilat aydīnā). While it is perhaps not im-\npossible to read this as a mere idiom or figure of speech, the second passage in question\nis more difficult to neutralise: in Q 38:75 God upbraids Iblīs for failing to “prostrate to\nwhat I have created with my hands,” bi-y adayya. As recognised by al- Ashʿarī (Gimaret\n1990, 326), the point of God’s statement here is presumably to highlight a trait of Adam\nthat endows him with peculiar dignity and elevates him over Iblīs— namely, the fact that\nGod has formed Adam in a more intimate fashion than other creatures. Hence, although\nthe Qur’anic God is perfectly capable of creating by verbal fiat, as maintained in places\nlike Q 2:117 and 3:47 (when God “decides on [creating] something, he merely says to it,\n‘Be,’ and it is,” idhā qaḍā amran fa-i nnamā yaqūlu lahu kun fa- yakūn), he can also create\nin what is literally a hands-on manner, by making use of his own limbs.30 In passing, one\nmay note that the claim that humans were fashioned manually has pre- Qur’anic paral-\nlels that lend further support to taking it quite literally. According to Aphrahat, Adam\nalone was created by God’s own hands while every thing else was created by God’s word\n28 Note also that there are a fair number of Qur’anic verses in which the word ʿayn is clearly used as part\nof vari ous idioms. Thus, the “cooling” of someone’s eye can stand for the provision of relief or consolation (see\nthe collocation of ʿayn/aʿyun with the root q- r- r in Q 19:26, 20:40, 25:74, 28:9.13, 32:17, and 33:51; cf. CDKA 223).\nFurther idiomatic usages are found in Q 43:71 (wa- taladhdhu l- aʿyunu) and 102:7 (ʿayna l- yaqīn).\n29 On verse- final divine epithets in general, see Robinson 2003a, 198–201.\n30 According to Q 3:59, Jesus and Adam w ere both created by divine fiat: God “created him [namely, Adam]\nfrom earth, and then said to him, ‘Be,’ and he was” (khalaqahu min turābin thumma qāla lahu kun fa-y akūn). Does\nthis contradict Q 38:75? Not necessarily: it is quite conceivable that the shaping of Adam from earth (= khalaqahu\nmin turābin) that precedes God’s creative command in Q 3:59 is understood to involve God’s hands. If so, then\nmaybe the divine fiat served to bring Adam’s body alive a fter God had s haped it from earth. This reading, while\nplausible, does however generate the follow-on question of how Adam and Jesus’s vivification by divine fiat, as\nper Q 3:59, is to be reconciled with God’s blowing “some of his spirit (→ rūḥ)” into Adam (Q 15:29, 32:9, 38:72)\nor into Mary, thus engendering Jesus (Q 21:91, 66:12).

The same idea is\ndeveloped at length by Jacob of Sarug (Mathews 2020, 46–51, ll. 2157–2194): whereas all\nother creatures were brought into existence by a divine “signal” (remzā; cf. Decharneux\n2019, 244–245), Adam was uniquely created by God’s hands (l. 2169)—an instance of\ndivine self- abasement that prefigures the incarnation of Christ (ll. 2189–2194). The Cave\nof Treas ures also reports that Adam was shaped by God’s “holy hands” (Ri 1987, ch. 2:12;\nsee Zellentin 2017, 109).31\nThe preceding suggests that it is because the Qur’an quite literally understands God\nto possess a countenance, sensory percipience, and limbs capable of touching, grasping,\nor imparting movement that the Islamic scripture employs vari ous idioms and formulae\ninvolving these features. After all, there is no Qur’anic equivalent to Ephrem’s caveat that\nGod only “put on the names of body parts”— i.e., speaks of himself in anthropomorphic\nand anthropopathic language— due to the weakness of h uman understanding (Beck 1955,\nno. 31:1–4). The Qur’anic God, therefore, is not merely a body but also, at least in some\nsense, an anthropomorphic body: he is endowed with a face, he is empirically receptive\nto worldly occurrences (rather than just knowing about them), and he can directly, with\nhis own body, manipulate objects in the world. That the divine body has a fundamen-\ntally humanoid shape is further accentuated by the use of the verb istawā, “to stand up\nstraight” or “to sit upright,” which is applied both to God, indicating the modality of his\nbeing located on the throne (Q 7:54, 10:3, 13:2, 20:5, 25:59, 32:4, 57:4),32 and to humans,\nwho are described as “sitting upright” in a boat or on the back of a mount (Q 23:28, 43:13;\nsee CDKA 142).\nOf course, the history of Islamic theology and exegesis makes it amply clear that\nexegetical temperaments have difered widely with regard to the question of how to\ninterpret God’s anthropomorphic attributes in the Qur’an. Yet it seems fair to say that\nthe main succour of an allegorical approach to the prob lem stems from the “deep seated\nantagonism to anthropomorphism about God” (Ferré 1984, 203) that many Eu ro pean\nand Islamicate thinkers alike have inherited from an influential strand of ancient Greek\nthought. As suggested above, a historical- critical exegete w ill be well advised to resist such\nan attitude. Nonetheless, it is impor tant to underscore that Qur’anic anthropomorphism\nremains limited and guarded throughout and that the text supplies virtually no concrete\ndetails about God’s appearance. For instance, the humanoid predications just collated\ndo not entail that the divine body is a body made of flesh and blood, especially since we\nsaw that a number of Qur’anic verses hint that God is essentially luminous. In a similar\nmanner, the Qur’anic text in no way rules out that God’s vision and hearing might oper-\nate very diferently from their human counter parts and that the commonality between\ndivine perception and h uman perception is functional (e.g., involving an ability to take in\nvisual and acoustic information in real time) rather than physiological. The Qur’an does\nnot accordingly permit one to specify the degree to which God’s face, eyes, and hands\n31 It is worth remarking that the claim that God created only Adam with his hands is undermined by vari ous\nBiblical verses, such as Ps 8:4, 19:2, 95:5; Isa 48:13 and 66:2; and Exod 15:17. On the date of the Cave of Trea-\nsures, see now Minov 2021, 18–48, including a very critical assessment of the adequacy of Ri’s edition (Minov\n2021, 32–36). However, the statement that Adam was formed by God’s “sacred hands” appears in both of Ri’s\nmanuscript groups.\n32 The verb also figures in Q 53:6, in the context of a theophanic experience of the Qur’anic Messenger.\n74 allāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Specifically, the Qur’an’s\nmuted anthropomorphism recalls Biblical (more precisely, priestly) notions of YHWH’s\nkābôd or “glory,” conceived as a radiant body with miscellaneous humanoid features (Som-\nmer 2009, 60–61; see also Williams 2008, 59–63). Especially in ter est ing is a comparison\nwith the manner in which the book of Ezekiel describes the visionary appearance of YH-\nWH’s glory at Ezek 1:26 (on which see Williams 2009, 26–28): “and seated above the\nlikeness (dәmût) of a throne was a likeness resembling the appearance of a h uman (dәmût\nkә- marʾê ādām).” Not unlike the Qur’an, this passage combines a fundamentally humanoid\ncharacterisation of God’s figure with a marked reticence to provide any concrete detail.\nThus, the Qur’an stands in a tradition that has appropriately been called “transcendent\nanthropomorphism” (Williams 2009). To apply to the Qur’an language used by a Biblical\nscholar, God’s appearance may be “more like that of man than of any other creature,” but\nit nonetheless “defies adequate description” and any attempt at providing much concrete\ndetail (Miller 1972, 292).\nHow to explain the fact that what is arguably the closest parallel to the Qur’anic vision\nof a humanoid and luminous deity should consist in a literal reading of certain Biblical\npassages that many Christian readers had long come to exegete as allegories?34 The best\nhypothesis is perhaps to point to the Jewish tradition, which up until the early Islamic\nperiod deployed anthropomorphic discourse about God in a far more unbridled manner\nthan the Qur’an— for instance, when portraying the deity as weeping or laughing (Stern\n1992, 152, referencing, inter alia, b. B. Mәṣ. 59b).35 The Qur’an’s unconflicted ac cep tance\n33 One might compare this position to the interpretive balancing act enshrined in the classical Ashʿarite de-\nmand that God’s anthropomorphic attributes are to be considered true “without asking ‘how?’ ” (bi- lā kayf), i.e.,\nwithout giving them the concrete meaning they have when predicated of creatures (see Frank 1991, 154–168). This\ngeneral attitude, which Ayman Shihadeh helpfully describes as “noncognitivism” (Shihadeh 2006, 3–4), has roots\nin older traditionalist thought (Hoover, forthcoming, introduction). However, developed Ashʿarite ontology is\nnonetheless unequivocal that God is not a corporeal being. Hence, my exposition of the Qur’anic understanding\nof God would no doubt strike an Ashʿarite as veering into illicit takyīf (qualifying God by physical properties)\nor tashbīh (positing God to be similar to his creatures). A closer similarity exists with regard to Ibn Taymiyyah’s\ntreatment of divine attributes, which distinguishes between the known meaning (maʿnā) of the attributes that\nscripture predicates of God and their unknown modality or kayfiyyah (Hoover 2019, 111–118; see also Hoover\n2007, 48–56 and 235–236; Hoover 2018; Hoover 2020, 197–204). As Hoover explains, Ibn Taymiyyah maintains\nthat God is literally above certain entities, such as the divine throne, and he takes issue with arguments seeking\nto demonstrate God’s incorporeality. On Ibn Taymiyyah’s conception of God, see now also Hoover, forthcoming,\narguing that Ibn Taymiyyah understands the deity to be a spatially extended yet indivisible being that surrounds\nthe world. Despite Ibn Taymiyyah’s refreshing critique of kalām incorporealism, his position is therefore still\nsome way of from what I would consider to be the Qur’anic view that God is a luminous humanoid body.\n34 Thus, to quote a study by Hieromonk Alexander, Jacob of Sarug identifies the object of Ezekiel’s vision\nwith the second person of the Trinity (Alexander 2007, 189) and maintains that the “manifestation of the Son\nand Glory of God in human form signals the paradox and promise of the Incarnation” (Alexander 2007, 193). As\nAlexander continues to paraphrase Jacob, had it not been for the incarnation, “the human figure on the chariot\nwould have been cause for a genuine, theological scandal, and rightly criticized for giving shape to God who is\ninfinite, without any limit or form” (Alexander 2007, 195). Jacob is thus clearly opposed to an anthropomorphic-\nally literal understanding of Ezekiel’s vision.\n35 As Stern notes, in the rabbinic tradition discomfort with anthropomorphic language about God only\narose in the early medieval period, under the influence of Greek philosophical thought as mediated by Islamic\nculture (Stern 1992, 153).\nallāh 75", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

All three of the\ndivine organs and limbs mentioned in the Qur’an are well established in Biblical discourse\nabout God. For example, the Qur’anic phrases “seeking the face of God” (ibtighāˈa wajhi\nllāhi/rabbihi/rabbihim; Q 2:272, 13:22, 92:20) and “wanting (arāda) the face of God”\n(Q 6:52, 18:28, 30:38–39) have a literal Biblical counterpart (BEQ 446 and Baljon 1988,\n126; e.g., Ps 24:6, 27:8, 105:4, which have biqqēš + pānîm; the Peshitta has the verb bʿā).\nRegarding God’s eyes, one may refer to Gen 6:8 or Ps 11:4 and 33:18, while God’s hand or\nhands figure, inter alia, at Exod 15:17, Isa 48:13 and 66:2, and Ps 8:4, 19:2, 89:14, and 95:5.\nGod’s face, hands, and eyes are however not the only divine limbs that are invoked in the\nBible, which also speaks of God’s fin ger (see Exod 31:18), feet (Zech 14:4), or back (Exod\n33:23). In the Qur’an, this wider range of anthropomorphic figures of speech about God is\ntrimmed down to a small core, namely, God’s eyes, hands, and countenance. That at least\nsome mea sure of selectivity is at play h ere is indicated by the fact that the Qur’an retells the\nscene from Exodus featuring God’s back in a manner that does not involve any reference\nto divine body parts (cf. Exod 33:18–23 and Q 7:143).\nBy way of conjecturing a rationale for this par tic u lar se lection, the eyes, hands, and\nface may be viewed as emblematic of essential aspects of personhood. This is clear enough\nfor the eyes, representing sensory percipience, and the hands, representing unmediated\nphysical agency. As for God’s face, vari ous Qur’anic verses use the term wajh in the con-\ntext of interpersonal relations. H umans can turn their faces to God (e.g., Q 2:112, 6:79; see\nunder → aslama) and can engage in charitable spending, pray, and be steadfast b ecause\nthey “seek” or “want” God’s face (Q 2:272, 6:52, 13:22, 18:28, 30:38–39, 76:9, 92:18–20),\nmeaning perhaps that they aspire to proximity to him. It is, specifically, the faces of the\nblessed that w ill “gaze upon” their Lord, according to Q 75:22–23 (cf. also the additional\nreferences to the faces of the blessed in 3:106–107, 10:26, 80:38–39, 83:24, and 88:8–11).\nMoreover, many eschatological scenarios single out the humiliation and torment that will\nbe inflicted upon the faces of the damned (Q 3:106–107, 8:50, 10:27, 14:50, 17:97, 18:29,\n21:39, 23:104, 25:34, 27:90, 33:66, 39:60, 47:27, 54:48, 67:27, 75:24–25, 80:40–41, 88:2–5;\nsee also 4:47 and u nder → jahannam).36 This interpersonal import of the face is also evident\nin the purely human sphere: Joseph’s b rothers express the hope to one another that as a\nresult of killing Joseph, “the face of yourp father w ill be turned t owards you alone” (yakhlu\nlakum wajhu abīkum; Q 12:9), and the f aces of the repudiators give away their rejection of\nGod’s signs (Q 22:72).37 Thus, the notion of God’s face is solidly embedded in the Qur’an’s\n“symbolism of personal responsibility” (Rippin 2000) and epitomises God’s capacity for\ninterpersonal relations: to have a countenance is to be able to encounter other persons.\nA similar understanding of the face, including the face of God, has been attributed to the\n36 See also Q 17:7, threatening the Israelites that their foes, unleashed by God, will specifically afflict “their\nfaces” (li- yasūʾū wujūhakum). When Q 20:111 announces that “the f aces will be humbled before” (ʿanati l- wujūhu\nli-) God, this would seem to refer to the faces of the blessed and damned alike.\n37 By contrast, Q 48:29 remarks that Muhammad’s followers bear marks of prostration on their f aces.\n76 allāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Because of its ability to express\nemotions and reactions, pānîm denotes the subject insofar as it turns (pnh) to ‘face’ o thers,\ni.e., insofar as it is the subject of relationships. The term pānîm describes relationships.” In\nsum, by crediting God with eyes, hands, and a face, the Qur’an underscores core attributes\nof his personhood (which, again, is not to suggest that the three features in question are\nreducible to mere meta phors).38\nThe Qur’an’s general preoccupation with God’s personhood, in the sense of God’s in-\nterpersonal relatability, coheres with the Qur’anic emphasis on God’s proximity to pious\nand righ teous humans and his responsiveness to them, a theme whose importance has\nbeen recently underlined by Usman Shaikh.39 Thus, the Medinan verse Q 2:186 addresses\nthe Messenger, “When my servants ask youS about me, I am near (qarīb), responding to\nthe one who calls upon me (ujību daʿwata l- dāʿi idhā daʿāni).” This echoes earlier Meccan\nreminders of God’s closeness and responsiveness like Q 11:61 (inna rabbī qarībun mujīb,\n“My Lord is near and responsive”) and 40:60 (wa- qāla rabbukumu dʿūnī astajib lakum,\n“Yourp Lord has said, ‘Call upon me and I w ill respond to you’ ”). Many further Qur’anic\nverses similarly characterise God with the words ajāba and istajāba, “to respond”; as in\nQ 2:186 and 40:60, these verbs can combine with a derivative of the root d-ʿ - w, such as\ndaʿā + acc., “to call upon s.o.,” or some synonym thereof.40 As is clearly stated in Q 42:26,\nthose to whom God responds are “the ones who believe and do righ teous deeds” (wa-\nyastajību lladhīna āmanū wa-ʿ amilū l-ṣ āliḥāti), just as God’s merciful forgiveness is available\nto those who maintain a functioning relationship with him (see u nder → al- raḥmān). These\nare in fact the ones who have themselves “responded” (verb: istajāba or ajāba) to the call of\nGod (Q 3:172, 6:36, 8:24, 11:14, 13:18, 14:44, 28:50.65, 42:38.47, 46:31.32). The overall cycle\nof responsiveness that is inferable from the Qur’an is therefore one in which humans who\nrespond to the call of God’s messengers before the day of judgement (Q 42:47) may in turn\nrely on God’s readiness to respond to them. Qur’anic anthropomorphisms reside within\nthis general vision of a cycle of interpersonal responsiveness between God and humans.\nIts ultimate fulfilment and completion is eschatological: the eternal state of communion\nwith God, and also with one another, that will be the reward of the righ teous in paradise\n(see under → jannah).\n38 A similar point has been made about the Hebrew Bible (Clines 1968, 70–71): “the anthrophomorphisms\nused of Yahweh in the Old Testament do not enable us to construct an identi- kit picture of Yahweh’s physical\nappearance, as in the case, for example, with Greek deities described in Homer, but rather they concentrate\nattention on the personhood of Yahweh.”\n39 Some of the following observations, especially my attention to the verbs ajāba and istajāba, are indebted\nto Shaikh’s Oxford MPhil thesis, submitted in 2021, on “God’s Responsiveness in the Qurʾān,” which he may\ndevelop further.\n40 In addition to the references given in the main text, see Q 3:195, 8:9, 10:89, 12:34, 21:76.84.88.90, 27:62,\nand 37:75. By contrast, Q 7:194, 11:14, 13:14, 18:52, 28:64, 35:14, and 46:5 contend that the associators’ false deities\nare unable to respond to h uman calls for assistance.

The claim, which is prob ably equivalent to affirmations that God prevents\nthe heaven from collapsing upon the earth (Q 22:65; cf. 35:41) or that he has propped\nup the heaven “without a pillar that youp can see” (Q 13:2, 31:10; → samāʾ), articulates the\nintuition that God has not only primordially brought the cosmos into existence but con-\ntinually preserves it in existence (Baljon 1958, 9; see u nder → khalaqa). The cosmos, then,\nis wholly pervaded by and subservient to God’s sovereignty: “when he wants something,\nhis command is merely to say to it, ‘Be,’ and it is” (Q 36:82: innamā amruhu idhā arāda\nshayʾan an yaqūla lahu kun fa- yakūn). As we shall see below, evocations of God’s amr can\noccasionally seem to take on an almost hypostatic guise, although this impression will ul-\ntimately turn out to be misleading. From a comparative perspective, it is noteworthy that\nthe phrase bi- amrihi, referring to God’s command, is also attested in a poem attributed\nto Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt that may be aut hen tic: God’s angelic messengers, the text says,\n“traverse the heaven by his command” (Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:33 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:33;\ncf. Seidensticker 2011b, 47–49).\nGod’s amr as his authoritative and decisive intervention. In other cases, amr signifies\na decisive divine intervention more generally rather than specifically a divine command.\nA good example is the declaration, in Q 9:106, that some p eople w ill be “deferred to God’s\namr, whether he will punish them or relent towards them” (murjawna li- amri llāhi immā\nyuʿadhdhibuhum wa- immā yatūbu ʿalayhim). Paret and Ambros render the term amr in\nsuch cases as “decision” (e.g., Q 2:275: amruhu ilā llāhi, “the decision about him is God’s”),\nwhich at least sometimes may be modified to “decisive intervention.” This signification of\nthe term amr is particularly associated with the verbs jāʾa and atā, “to come” (CDKA 28).2\nThus, in recounting the story of Noah the divine voice describes the onset of the deluge\nas the moment “when our decisive intervention (amr) came” (Q 11:40, 23:27), and the\nsame phrase is used in connection with God’s deliverance of the messengers Hūd, Ṣāliḥ,\nand Shuʿayb (Q 11:58.66.94) as well as his punishment of the people of Lot (Q 11:76.82;\nsee also 11:101). Such decisive divine interventions have occurred in the distant past, and\nMedinan verses suggest that they are also a feature of the pre sent (Q 57:14, prob ably also\n5:52). In other cases, though, the coming or bringing of God’s amr refers to the end of the\nworld and God’s final judgement (Q 16:1.33, perhaps also 2:109 and 40:78; see Shoemaker\n2018, 138–139).3 This usage is already pre sent in early Meccan texts: in Q 54:50 the divine\nvoice states that “our decisive intervention is only a single act, like the glance of an eye”\n(wa- mā amrunā illā wāḥidatun ka- lamḥin bi- l- baṣar; see Baljon 1958, 10, n. 2), while Q 82:19\n1 Baljon 1958, 10, points out the parallel between Q 31:31 (anna l- fulka tajrī fī l- baḥri bi- niʿmati llāhi) and\n22:65 (wa- l- fulka tajrī fī l- baḥri bi- amrihi), which shows that God’s command and God’s grace (on which see\nunder → anʿama) can be substituted for each other.\n2 Paret 2001 mostly opts for Entscheidung.\n3 Shoemaker proposes that God’s amr in the Qur’an is to some degree equivalent to God’s eschatological\n“reign” or “kingdom” as familiar from the Christian tradition, although he admits, presumably in view of non-\neschatological occurrences like Q 11:58.66, that this usage is not consistent. It should also be noted that the Qur’an\ndoes contain a few cases in which the root m- l- k, which is more directly connected to the idea of kingly rule,\nhas an evident eschatological context (e.g, Q 6:73; → malik). Thus, the Christian notion of God’s eschatological\nkingdom is more clearly reflected by a dif er ent Qur’anic term than the word amr.\namr 79", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The reason why amr can have this broader meaning\nof a decisive or an authoritative intervention is illuminated by Bravmann’s study of the se-\nmantics of amr in early Arabic (Bravmann 1972, 39–63). Reviewing a range of pre- Islamic\nand early Islamic poetry, Bravmann argues that amr can refer to “the serious action of a\nman, frequently of war- like character, towards which the energetic intention of a man\n(his ‘command to himself’) or a group (a tribe) is directed” (Bravmann 1972, 62). At\nseveral junctures, therefore, Bravmann suggests that someone’s amr is best rendered as\nhis “ will to action” or “energetic action” (e.g., Bravmann 1972, 46, 48–55). As alluded to\nin the preceding quotation, Bravmann proposes that this meaning of amr is to be derived\nfrom the notion of a mental command directed to oneself (Bravmann 1972, 48, 52–53).5\nQur’anic references to God’s amr can be understood to transfer such pre-I slamic evoca-\ntions of a warrior’s vigorous resolve onto the deity (see Anthony, forthcoming). While\nQur’anic passages speaking of the coming of God’s amr or the like are focused not just\non God’s energetic resolve to act but also on the manifestation of this resolve in real ity,\nsome Qur’anic verses do in fact foreground the former aspect. Thus, Q 4:47 and 33:37\nannounce wa- kāna amru llāhi maf ʿūlā (cf. 8:42.44), which should prob ably be translated\n“God’s resolve will be enacted” rather than “God’s command will be carried out” or the\nlike, while Q 65:3 proclaims inna llāha bālighu amrihi, “God will attain his purpose” or\n“realise his resolve.” As Bravmann notes, Q 65:3 resembles a phrase in the Muʿallaqah of\nal- Ḥārith ibn Ḥilllizah, wa-a mru llāhi balghun, which Bravmann renders “God’s will to\naction (or: God’s energetic action) attains (its end)” (Bravmann 1972, 54–55, citing Lyall\n1894, 138, v. 62).6 Other Qur’anic instances in which the meaning of amr seems to incline\ntowards an agent’s intention or resolve to act rather than the action itself are two verses\ncombining amr with the verb ajmaʿa, namely, Q 10:71 (Noah to his opponents: ajmiʿū\namrakum, “resolve on your course of action,” “make up your minds”) and 12:102 (with re-\nspect to Joseph’s brothers: idh ajmaʿū amrahum wa- hum yamkurūn, “when they made up\ntheir minds and plotted”). This collocation too has a parallel in poetry (DSAAP, Zuhayr,\nno. 20:25, discussed in Bravmann 1972, 53–54). Its contrary is tanāzaʿū amrahum bayna-\nhum, “they quarrelled among themselves about their course of action” (Q 18:21, 20:62; on\ntanāzaʿa + amr, see also below).\nAmr in the generic senses of “conduct” and “ matter, affair.” In some cases, amr seems\nto have evolved from denoting someone’s resolve to act or the ensuing action to a designa-\ntion of his or her general conduct, as in the idiom dhāqa wabāla amrihi, “to taste the bad\nconsequences of one’s actions” (Q 5:95, 59:15, 64:5, 65:9; see Baljon 1958, 8, and CDKA\n283; → dhāqa). In other instances, amr fades into the generic sense of “ matter, afair”\n4 Potentially also eschatological is Q 9:48, which speaks of God’s amr becoming manifest (ẓahara).\n5 Bravmann maintains that this is in fact the basic meaning of the eighth-f orm verb iʾtamara, which he glosses\nas “to command oneself,” “to impose something, especially a task, upon oneself” (Bravmann 1972, 46–47).\nHowever, at least the Qur’anic occurrences of iʾtamara must clearly be translated as “to consult together, to de-\nliberate” (Q 28:20, 65:6; CDKA 27); they convey a discussion within a group (in Q 28:20, the Egyptian notables\nor → malaʾ) rather than an individual act of mental resolve.\n6 Against Nöldeke’s doubts about the authenticity of this verse, Bravmann accepts it as pre- Qur’anic, arguing\nthat the following sentence yashqā bihi l- ashqiyāʾ expresses the “decidedly ‘pagan’ idea” that “the ill- fated become\nthrough it wretched” (Bravmann’s italics).\n80 amr", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Similarly, in Q 3:159 the Qur’anic Messenger is urged to consult with the believers “in\nthe matter” at hand (shāwirhum fī l- amri), which appear to be considerations of military\nstrategy; and in Q 47:26 the apostates are accused of saying to t hose who hate God’s rev-\nelations, “We w ill obey you in part of the matter [at hand]” (sa- nuṭīʿukum fī baʿḍi l- amri).\nSimilarly, tanāzaʿtum fī l-a mri in Q 3:152 and 8:43 could be understood to mean either\n“youp quarrelled about the course of action [to be adopted]” or “youp quarrelled about\nthe matter [at hand]” (cf. Q 22:67: fa-l ā yunāziʿunnaka fī l-a mri, “they are not to argue\nwith you about the matter”). The same generic meaning “ matter, afair” may furthermore\nbe operative in the phrase qaḍā amran, “to decide or s ettle a m atter,” in the sense of deal-\ning with a situation that is objectively given and in need of resolution. Thus, according\nto Q 33:36, “when God and his Messenger have de cided (qaḍā) a matter (amr),” it does\nnot befit any believing man or woman “to have a choice in their course of action” (an\nyakūna lahumu l- khiyaratu min amrihim). In many other cases, however, the phrase qaḍā\namran— whose grammatical subject is, apart from Q 33:36, always God alone (Q 2:117,\n3:47, 8:42.44, 15:66, 19:35, 28:44, 40:68)—a ppears to refer to a f uture state of afairs that\nGod has resolved to bring about. Thus, when God “decides on [creating] something, he\nmerely says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is” (Q 2:117, 3:47, 19:35, 40:68: idhā qaḍā amran fa- innamā\nyaqūlu lahu kun fa- yakūn).8 The collocation of qaḍā + amr also figures in the passive as\nquḍiya l- amru, “the matter was settled.” The latter can signify the arrival of the eschaton\n(Q 2:210, 6:8.58, 14:22, 19:39), which precludes h umans from making any further changes\nto the moral balance of their lives, although an eschatological sense does not apply at\nQ 11:44 and 12:41 (cf. also wa- kāna amran maqḍiyyā in 19:21, which is prob ably a variant\non quḍiya l- amru motivated by rhyme).\nGod’s amr or command as a hypostasis mediating God’s cosmic rule? A small clus-\nter of Qur’anic passages give the appearance of depicting God’s amr in a personified or\nreified fashion, as originally argued by Hubert Grimme (Grimme 1895, 50–53) and subse-\nquently endorsed by a string of influential scholars, including Heinrich Speyer and Rudi\nParet (BEQ 4, 24–26, and KK 25; see now also Decharneux 2019, 249–254, and Anthony,\nforthcoming). One of the clearest prooftexts for this view is the Medinan verse Q 65:12:\nGod has “created seven heavens and their like of the earth, and God’s command (al- amr)\ndescends (yatanazzalu) between them, so that youp might know that God is endowed with\npower over every thing and that God encompasses every thing in knowledge.” At least at\nfirst sight, the verse does indeed give the impression that the amr is a vicarious hypostasis\nof God that is at liberty to roam through the cosmos, ensuring a direct and immediate link\nof communication between God and dif er ent components of the created order while si-\nmult a neously safeguarding the deity’s ontological distance and transcendence. The same\nimpression emerges from the Meccan passage Q 32:4–5, which relates how God, a fter cre-\nating the heavens and the earth, sat down on the throne (see also under → allāh), whence\n7 Note Paret’s astute remark that amr can signify “ matter, afair” in so far as the latter is “somehow conceived\nas subject to authoritative resolution” (KK 25).\n8 Cf. the parallels at Q 16:40 and 36:82, which speak of God “wanting” or “willing” something (36:82: idhā\narāda shayʾan).\namr 81", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

O’Shaughnessy 1953, 36).10\nScholars who have been persuaded of a hypostatic understanding of verses like Q 32:5\nhave tended to link it to the targumic concept of God’s memra or “word” (Grimme 1895,\n51; JPND 188–190; BEQ 4 and 24–26; Ahrens 1935, 133–134; O’Shaughnessy 1953, 39–40).\nIt is however impor tant to note, with Sean Anthony, that this supplementary genealogical\nconjecture is separate from the basic interpretive prob lem of whether or not the Qur’an\ndoes indeed express a hypostatic understanding of God’s amr (Anthony, forthcoming), a\nquestion that will be explored in the following section. Moreover, the question whether\ntargumic references to God’s memra have a hypostatic significance or are merely rever-\nential circumlocutions is itself highly controversial (see, e.g., McNamara 2010, 146–148,\n154–166, and Boyarin 2004, 112–127). It has also been questioned whether Arabic amr,\ngiven its inner- Arabic semantics, would really have been a plausible rendering of memra\n(Leemhuis 1977, 46–47). In any case, alternative antecedents to the Qur’anic notion of\nGod’s “directing the amr” are found in Syriac texts, including the claim that the heavenly\nspheres are “at the command (pūqdānā) of God” (Vööbus 1979, 253; see Decharneux\n2019, 251–252, and Anthony, forthcoming, both crediting the parallel to Zellentin). As\nobserved not only by Decharneux and Anthony but also de cades ago by Fred Leemhuis\n(Leemhuis 1977, 48), Syriac expresses God’s “governance” of the world by the noun\nmdabbrānūtā (e.g., Vööbus 1979, 252), whose corresponding verb dabbar (“to rule, to\ngovern”; see SL 272) is cognate with the Arabic verb dabbara employed in Q 32:5 and its\nparallels 10:3.31 and 13:2.\nA non- hypostatic reading of Q 32:5 and 65:12 in light of 41:12 and 97:4. Does the\nQur’an, then, formulate a hypostatic or reified understanding of God’s amr? Upon closer\nexamination it is far from certain that this can be assumed to be the case (see already Baljon\n1958, 16). The Meccan verse Q 41:12, for one, implies a very dif ere nt scenario. Like Q 32:4–5\nand 65:12, it occurs in a context to do with divine creation, and like 65:12 it mentions God’s\nbringing forth of seven heavens. Q 41:12 then goes on to say that God “conveyed” to e very\nheaven its amr (wa- awḥā fī kulli samāʾin amrahā). This could indicate that each of the heav-\nens, a fter having been created, received a general divine command determining its specific\nnature and comportment—a reading that is supported by the manner in which Jacob of\nSarug describes God’s governance of the sun (Mathews 2018, 42–43, ll. 1483–1488): God\ngave it an initial “impetus” (ḥēpā), a fter which “t here was no need for Him to command\nit again (d- tūb nepqod) to continue its course.”11 Alternatively, the idea may be that God\ngoverns the behaviour of each heaven, and indeed of each being in the world, by means of\n9 I assume that Arabic dabbara is h ere largely equivalent with its Syriac cognate dabbar (“to rule, to govern”),\non which see below (and from which it may well have been loaned, as suggested in CDKA 95).\n10 A further three passages resemble Q 32:5 in casting God as “directing the amr” (Q 10:3.31, 13:2: yudabbiru\nl- amra). Even if they do not explic itly testify to the amr’s capability of spatial separation from the deity, one’s\ndefault approach should clearly be to translate them analogously to Q 32:5.\n11 See also Baljon 1958, 8, who takes amr in Q 41:12 to be the heavens’ “destiny and task, indicated to them\nby the Creator.”\n82 amr", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This would be more in line with the Qur’anic tendency elsewhere to envisage\nGod as exercising a direct causal role in individual occurrences of natur al pro cesses like the\nfalling of rain (see u nder → allāh).12 In e ither case, Q 41:12 does not depict a unitary and\nquasi- hypostatic divine amr moving around the cosmos and deputising for God in admin-\nistering a multitude of created beings. Instead, it portrays God as governing each heaven,\nand prob ably each created being, by means of par tic ul ar commands that are transmitted\nthrough an act of communicative conveyance (→ awḥā) and dictate their behaviour. All of\nthis is further borne out by Q 16:68, according to which God conveys (awḥā) to the bees to\nconstruct their hives in mountains, trees, and buildings.\nA similarly non-h ypostatic scenario emerges from Q 97:4: during the mysterious “night\nof foreordainment” (laylat al-q adr; see Sinai 2012 and CDKA 220), the angels and the\nspirit are said to “descend” (tanazzalu) “by permission (idhn) of their Lord due to many a\n[divine] command” (bi- idhni rabbihim min kulli amrin).13 What this means is clarified by\nQ 44:3–5, where the divine voice says, ostensibly about the same night, that in it “many\na wise command is determined” (v. 4: fīhā yufraqu kullu amrin ḥakīm), “as a command\nproceeding from us” (v. 5: amran min ʿindinā). Our best guess at the under lying notion is\nthat of an annually recurrent night in which God ordains (all or some of) the events that\nwill take place during the following year, an idea that has Jewish and Babylonian parallels\n(Wensinck 1925, 3–5; see also Wagtendonk 1968, 83–86, 106–108, and Lohmann 1969,\n281–282).14 Q 97:4 thus seems to be saying that during the laylat al- qadr the angels and\nthe spirit descend in order to transmit God’s decrees or commands to the created order.\nLike Q 41:12, God’s governance of the world is here mediated by means of a multiplicity\nof individual amrs rather than via a unitary and hypostatic cosmic amr.\nThis scenario may in fact be extended to Q 32:4–5 and 65:12, the primary prooftexts\nfor a hypostatic understanding of God’s amr. Although both speak of al- amr in the singu-\nlar, it is well known that the Arabic definite singular can have a generic meaning. Thus,\nal- fulk means “ships” in general rather than any specific ship in Q 2:164, 14:32, or 45:12 (in\ncontrast to places like 7:64 or 10:73, where reference is indeed to a specific ship, namely,\nNoah’s ark), and al-n aḥl in Q 16:68 are “the bees,” not “the bee” ( unless one were to\nemploy the singular in a generic meaning that is uncommon in con temporary En glish).\nIn view of this, the phrase yatanazzalu l- amru baynahunna (namely, between the seven\n12 It would also correspond to the way in which Jacob of Sarug describes God’s control over the combustive\nefect of fire (Mathews 2018, 20–23, ll. 1281–1298).\n13 My translation assumes that the preposition min designates what Wright calls the “causal point of de-\nparture” h ere (Wright 1974, 2:131–132). This also seems to be the understanding of Wagtendonk, who translates\nmin as “by virtue of” and remarks that “the angels descend as a result of the amr” (Wagtendonk 1968, 83–84,\nwith n. 5). Cf. also Q 13:11, where yaḥfaẓūnahu min amri llāhi means “they watch over him by [or due to] God’s\ncommand.” In a more ad hoc fashion, al- Zamakhsharī paraphrases min by min ajli (Zam. 6:410), while Neuwirth\n(PP 102) suggests that min may here be equated with fī. On kull + indefinite singular, see Bauer 2010, 706–715.\nOn Q 97:4 being a later insertion, see Lohmann 1969, 283; PP 96–97; Sinai 2012, 23–25, 28–30. On the lexeme\nqadr, see also Caskel 1926, 20–21, and el Masri 2020, 69–70.\n14 Wagtendonk maintains that the laylat al- qadr was a night of divine reckoning and judgement, which I find\nless cogent than Wensinck’s view. Wagtendonk’s principal piece of evidence seems to be that Q 78:38 mentions\na joint appearance of the angels and the spirit in connection with the eschatological judgement. Other parallels\nadduced by him, such as Q 70:4, are even less conclusive.

Unlike the questionable link between God’s “directing the amr” and\nthe targumic memra, the Syriac precursors noted by Anthony remain pertinent to such a\nnon- hypostatic reading of the Qur’anic material. In addition, in gauging the full semantic\npurport of yudabbiru l- amra one should furthermore take into account the early Meccan\nverse Q 79:5 (fa- l- mudabbirāti amrā), occurring in an oath passage depicting a raid (see\nSPMC 106–107), where dabbara amran must mean something like “to execute a resolve,”\nalong the lines set out by Bravmann. Hence, when the l ater Meccan verses Q 10:3.31, 13:2,\nand 32:5 apply the phrase yudabbiru l-a mra to God, this would also have connoted the\nvigorous and energetic manner in which God implements his decrees and designs (see\nalso Anthony, forthcoming). A translation of yudabbiru l- amra that reflect this polyvalence\nmight be to say that God “directs his commanding resolve.”\nGod’s command and “the spirit.” A final set of verses mentioning God’s amr and calling\nfor brief discussion are Q 16:2, 17:85, 40:15, and 42:52. All four describe “the spirit” (see in\nmore detail u nder → rūḥ) as being “of” or “originating from” (min) God’s amr. The “spirit”\ncan sometimes figure as a quasi-a ngelic being tasked with the conveyance of revelations (cf.\nQ 16:102, 26:193). The verses at hand too are concerned with divine inspiration, even if they\ndo not in a similarly unequivocal fashion pre sent the spirit as an in de pen dent agent. The point\nof describing the spirit as being “of God’s amr” is presumably to underline his subordinate\nand merely executive nature: the spirit operates only “by” or “due to God’s command,” at\nleast if we parse the preposition min in a causal sense h ere (as does Durie 2018, 170), in line\nwith the above translation of min kulli amrin in Q 97:4 as “due to many a [divine] command”\n(cf. Muqātil 2002, 2:459, glossing min amrihi at Q 16:2 as bi- amrihi, while Jal. 973 ofers\nbi- irādatihi).15 To review the four verses in more detail, according to Q 16:2 and 40:15 God\n“sends down the angels with the spirit, [acting] by his command (bi- l- rūḥi min amrihi)” or\n“casts the spirit [acting] by his command” (yulqī l- rūḥa min amrihi) “upon whomsoever\nhe w ills from among his servants,” while in Q 42:52 the divine voice affirms, “Thus do we\nconvey to youS a spirit [acting] by our command” (wa- ka- dhālika awḥaynā ilayka rūḥan min\n15 Once again, note that the causal meaning of min is obvious in Q 13:11: yaḥfaẓūnahu min amri llāhi, “they\nwatch over him by [or due to] God’s command.” Fazlur Rahman proposes to equate God’s amr in places like\nQ 16:2 with “what the Qurʾān calls the ‘Preserved Tablet’ or the ‘ Mother of the Books’ ” (see Rahman 2009, 98,\nalluding to Q 85:22 and 43:4), but this hypothesis has no obvious textual support. According to Grimme, the\nverses under consideration express the Neoplatonically tinged idea that “the spirit” emanates from the divine\namr, understood as a hypostatic intermediary between God and the world (Grimme 1895, 51–52). Eichler too\nrules out that amr might mean “command” in the passages u nder consideration; he appears to be arguing that\neven without the min amrihi qualification, the verses under discussion already make it sufficiently clear that God\nis the sender of the spirit (DTEK 124–125).\n84 amr", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This verse too shares the revelatory context seen in Q 16:2,\n40:15, and 42:52, in so far as the following verse, Q 17:86, mentions revelatory communication\nwith the Qur’anic Messenger (awḥaynā ilayka).\nThe preceding interpretation of the four verses combining rūḥ with min amri . . . i s sup-\nported by considering the most likely background to the question cited in Q 17:85, which\nchallenges the Qur’anic Messenger with regard to “the spirit.” It is likely that the question\nis adversarial.17 Examining chronologically e arlier Qur’anic statements about “the spirit,”\nthe query cited in Q 17:85 may well have been triggered by verses casting “the spirit” as\nan in de pen dent agent, such as Q 26:193 (claiming that it is “the trustworthy spirit,” al- rūḥ\nal- amīn, who transmits revelations to the Qur’anic Messenger) and 19:17 (recounting how\nGod dispatched his spirit, rūḥanā, to Mary, “and it appeared to her as a shapely h uman”).\nThe point of the question posed in Q 17:85 would accordingly have been the charge that\nthe Qur’anic revelations’ refusal to countenance “associate” deities besides God (e.g.,\nQ 17:111; → ashraka) was inconsistent with their evocation of “the spirit,” which could\neasily have been perceived as substantially akin to the subordinate deities worshipped\nby Muhammad’s opponents. Against this line of attack, Q 17:85 would then have insisted,\ntogether with Q 16:2, 40:15, and 42:52, that the Qur’an’s revelation- bearing “spirit” merely\nexecutes God’s commands and cannot therefore be considered an autonomous would-be\ndeity.

The prevalent meaning of the noun ummah in the Qur’an (on which see gen-\nerally Denny 1975 and Zafer 2020) is “community.” To be sure, some instances of the\nword clearly require a dif er ent translation: in Q 11:8 and 12:45 ummah seems to refer to a\nperiod of time, and in Q 43:22.23 the word must mean “exemplary custom or manner of\nproceeding” or the like, since Muhammad’s opponents and o thers before them are quoted\nas saying that they found their forefathers “adhering to an ummah” (wajadnā ābāʾanā ʿalā\nummatin) and that they would follow in their ancestors’ footsteps (see also u nder → ab).\nQ 16:120 describes Abraham as an ummah, which again means “model” or “exemplar”\nhere. This is supported by parallel statements in Q 2:124, which has imām, derived from\nthe same consonantal root as ummah, and 60:4.6, employing uswah.1 The significations\n“exemplar” and “exemplary custom” are related to the Arabic verb amma + acc., “to direct\noneself t owards s.o./s.th.” (JPND 190), whose participle appears in Q 5:2 (āmmīna l- bayta\nl- ḥarāma, “ those heading for the sacred h ouse”). We shall return to this connotation of\nthe root ʾ- m- m below.\nThe preceding occurrences apart, however, it is normally clear that the word ummah\nsignifies a group or community of p eople in the Qur’an. An inconspicuous example is\nQ 28:23, where Moses encounters “a group of people” (ummatan mina l- nāsi) at the Mid-\nianite well where he meets his f uture wife. In this dominant sense, ummah is loaned from\nJewish Aramaic uma/umta or Syriac ūmmtā, “nation, people,” corresponding to Hebrew\nummâ (JPND 190; FVQ 69; CDKA 29).2 Like Arabic ummah, these Aramaic and Hebrew\n1 Horovitz and Paret, though, are content to accept that ummah means “community” (i.e., “a commu-\nnity unto his own”) in Q 16:120 (JPND 190; KK 294). On imām, see CDKA 29; for a verse of early (though\nnot necessarily pre- Islamic) Arabic poetry in which imām means “model” or “exemplar,” see ʿAbbās 1962,\nno. 48:81 = EAP 2:199 (from the Muʿallaqah of Labīd; see also under → ab). Another Qur’anic occurrence of\nuswah, besides Q 60:4.6, is 33:21, though here the word is applied to Muhammad rather than Abraham. All\nthree Qur’anic instances of the word uswah (Q 33:21, 60:4.6) are followed by the adjective ḥasanah, “good.”\nQ 2:124, 16:120, and 60:4.6 should also be compared with 43:59, calling Jesus a → mathal ( here perhaps:\n“exemplar”) for the Israelites.\n2 For attestations in Syriac and Jewish Aramaic, see DJPA 39–40, DJBA 91, and SL 17. For instance, a poem in\nJewish Palestianian Aramaic calls the p eople of Israel “a beloved p eople (umma rḥima), chosen from all p eoples”\n(Sokolof and Yahalom 1999, 158 = no. 21:1–2; cf. ibid., 168 = no. 25:2).\n86 ummah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Th ese also hold\nfor many occurrences of ummah in the Qur’an that w ill be discussed in what follows. How-\never, the Qur’an also documents a dif ere nt modulation of the word, in which it designates\na community that is not or not primarily defined by kinship but rather by shared religious\ncommitments (similarly Zafer 2020). This usage emerges in the Medinan surahs, though it\nis rooted in aspects of prior Meccan usage, and it reflects the gradual transformation of the\nMedinan population into a community united by recognition of the Qur’anic revelations\nand of Muhammad’s prophetic authority. A crucial step in this development would have\nbeen the expulsion of the Medinan “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb) that is alluded to\nin Surah 59 and in Q 33:26–27.\nThe word ummah must have been pre sent in Arabic prior to the Qur’an, since it occurs\nin a poem of al-N ābighah (DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 17:21): somebody who is dhū ummah\nwould not voluntarily commit a sin, such as swearing a false vow. Wellhausen avers that\nal- Nābighah uses ummah to refer to a community of a religious nature (Wellhausen 1889,\n74), and indeed the word is standardly glossed as dīn in the verse at hand (e.g., al-Ḥ ittī\n1991, 125, n. 22). However, the context is too meagre to allow a conclusive verdict. In fact,\nit is not impossible to interpret al-N ābighah’s dhū ummah as “someone who adheres to his\nancestors’ exemplary conduct,” in line with Q 43:22.23 (KU 52).\nUmmah as a community of kinship. Qur’anic occurrences of ummah often preserve\nthe ethnic connotations of its Aramaic cognate. Thus, comparison between Q 13:7 (li-\nkulli qawmin hād, “ every people has a guide”), on the one hand, and Q 10:47 (li-k ulli\nummatin rasūlun, “ every community has a messenger”) and 16:36, on the other, shows\nthat ummah can at least sometimes operate as a synonym of qawm, which often (but by\nno means always) refers to a community (possibly imagined) of kinship, a “ people.”3 The\nsame is shown by Q 40:5, where qawm and ummah figure in close proximity and appear to\nbe interchangeable. Qur’anic passages in which the word ummah designates a community\nof kinship may be deemed to include the following statements: land animals and birds\ndivide into dif er ent “communities” like humans (Q 6:38),4 as do demons or the → jinn\n(Q 7:38, 41:25, 46:18); God has sent messengers to previous h uman communities (Q 6:42,\n16:63), and indeed e very community has its dedicated messenger or warner (Q 10:47, 16:36,\n35:24; → rasūl), yet these messengers were invariably accused of lying (Q 23:44; cf. 27:83,\n29:18, 40:5); every community has its “term” (→ ajal; Q 7:34, 10:49, 15:5, 23:43); and\non the day of judgement God w ill produce a “witness” (shahīd) from among every com-\nmunity to testify against it, this witness being the respective community’s messenger, just\nas Muhammad will bear witness against his community (Q 4:41, 16:84.89, 28:75; cf. also\n45:28).5 As the preceding references show, the use of ummah in the sense of a “ people” is\noverwhelmingly Meccan, though it continues to reverberate in at least one Medinan verse,\nQ 4:41. A second potentially Medinan occurrence is Q 7:160, which glosses the twelve\n3 To cite just one of many examples where qawm simply means a group of people irrespective of whether\nthey are united by ties of kinship, see Q 5:84, according to which the Christians are quoted as saying that “we are\neager for our Lord to let us enter [paradise] together with the p eople who are right eous (maʿa l-q awmi l-ṣ āliḥīn).”\nThat qawm refers to a kinship community may generally be presumed for instances in which the word occurs in\na genitive construction or with a possessive suffix (e.g., Q 2:54.60.67, 46:21).\n4 On the way in which this verse is treated by Muslim commentators, see Tlili 2012, 139–146, and SQ 352–353.\n5 In Q 2:143 and 22:78, the word shahīd seems to have a dif er ent significance; see under → al-ʿ ālamūn.\nummah 87", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

A bit further on in the same surah, the divine\nvoice states that he made the believers a “ middle community” (Q 2:143: wa-k a-d hālika\njaʿalnākum ummatan wasaṭan), “so that youp might be witnesses set up over the p eople\n(li-t akūnū shuhadāʾa ʿalā l-n āsi) and the Messenger might be a witness (shahīd) set up\nover you.”7 This most likely means that the Qur’anic ummah is to function as an exemplary\nbeacon of true belief and right eousness for humankind at large, a sort of “light to the na-\ntions,” to put it in Biblical language (for more detail, see under → al-ʿ ālamūn). The context\nof the verse is consistent with the assumption that the Qur’anic ummah is here conceived\nin distinction to Jews and Christians, who are mentioned in v. 140 (cf. also the further ref-\nerences to the “scripture- owners” in vv. 145–146). The reading of Q 2:128.143 just outlined\nis further corroborated by the extensive attention that e arlier sections of Surah 2 devote\nto the manifold lapses and transgressions of the Israelites (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl), who clearly\nfunction as a negative counterpart to the Qur’anic ummah, exemplifying how a divinely\nchartered community of believers ought not to operate. The significance of the Qur’anic\nummah for humankind or “the p eople” at large (al-n ās; see again under → al- ʿālamūn)\nis also underlined in Q 3:110, where the addressees are called “the best community ever\nbrought forth for people” (kuntum khayra ummatin ukhrijat li- l-n āsi), “enjoining right and\ndissuading from wrong and believing in God.” Hence, in Q 2:128.143 and 3:110 the ummah\nis clearly a community of believers, set apart from other human groups by their stance\nof self- surrender to God and invested with a critical role in God’s stewardship of human\nhistory g oing forward.8 (Incidentally, members of the Medinan community may well have\nbelieved that there was not much history left prior to the resurrection and eschatological\njudgement; see under → sāʿah.)\nOne aspect of the inner workings of the Medinan ummah that deserves note in this\ncontext is the fact that the Qur’an seems to envisage its individual members as being\nengaged in reciprocal acts of moral and religious counsel, admonishment, and fortifica-\ntion. This is foregrounded in verses like Q 90:17 and 103:3 and may also be implied by the\nformula “enjoining right and dissuading from wrong” (see in more detail u nder → maʿrūf).\nIn addition to being guided by Muhammad, therefore, the ummah of the believers is\nalso understood to be at least to some degree self- guiding or self- correcting.

Pertinent Meccan data include the assertion that\nhad God wanted he could have made h umans a “single community” (ummatan wāḥidatan;\nsee Q 11:118, 16:93, 42:8; cf. also 43:33 and the Medinan parallel 5:48). This should prob-\nably be understood to mean that God could have maintained them as a single community,\ngiven that Q 10:19 says that h umans did in fact form a single primordial community but\nsubsequently fell into disagreement (fa- khtalafū), an idea reprised in the Medinan verse\n2:213 ( people formed “a single community,” upon which God sent prophets in order to\n“adjudicate between people concerning what they disagreed about,” li-y aḥkuma bayna\nl- nāsi fī mā khtalafū fīhi). Muslim interpreters who took Q 2:213 and 10:19 to assert a pri-\nmordial unity of humankind understood the unity in question to be of a religious nature\n(Friedmann 2003, 14–19). This is cogent, given that the verb ikhtalafa (“to disagree, to\nfall into disagreement”) that is found in both verses tends to refer specifically to discord\nconcerning religious m atters, as illustrated not only by Q 2:213 itself but also by vario us\nother occurrences (e.g., Q 2:176, 27:76, 39:3, 41:45, 43:63; for more detail on ikhtalafa, see\nunder → bayyana and → ḥizb). Hence, the single h uman community that is attributed to\nthe remote past or whose establishment is affirmed as being within God’s power is not,\nor not primarily, a community united by kinship and descent but rather one that is not\nriven by conflict in religious m atters (see also Q 5:48 and 11:118, which like 2:213 and 10:19\ncontrast the “single community,” ummah wāḥidah, with the verb ikhtalafa, “to disagree”;\ncf. 21:92–93 and 23:52–53).11 Given that a number of the verses just cited are Meccan,\nthe Qur’anic use of the noun ummah to designate a community sharing a certain ethico-\nreligious outlook is therefore already encountered prior to the hijrah.\nThe same nuance may also be detected in Q 7:159, which states that “among the p eople\n(qawm) of Moses there is a community (ummah) who guide according to the truth and\nact justly according to it”: within the ethnically or genealogically defined collective of the\nIsraelites, there is or was a smaller subgroup sharing a commitment to religious truth and\nits moral implications. Two Medinan passages make similar use of the term ummah to refer\n9 Of course, it is also pos si ble to read Q 2:44 as formulating the complaint not that the Israelites are failing\nto admonish one another to be righ teous but rather that they are failing to practise righ teousness.\n10 The significance of such statements is reinforced by the notorious fact that the Qur’an fails to give explicit\ninstructions about who is to assume leadership of the ummah after Muhammad’s death, even though Muham-\nmad is unequivocally seen as mortal and the possibility of his demise prior to the end of the world is expressly\nenvisaged (see Q 3:144, 10:46, 13:40, 40:77, 43:41–42; see also HCI 52). Given this state of afairs, it would not\nbe indefensible for a Muslim theologian to look to the Qur’an’s implicit assumption of communal self- correction\nas one impor tant impor tant mechanism by which the ummah must operate a fter Muhammad’s demise. This has\nbeen argued to be the view of Ibn Taymiyyah (Anjum 2012, 229–232).\n11 Although Q 16:93 and 42:8 contain the expression ummah wāḥidah but not the verb ikhtalafa, it seems\nclear at least for the latter verse that the lack of unity at stake is also of a moral or religious nature.

The complex redactional history of Surah 7 has not yet been adequately\nunravelled (see under → ummī and → al-a sbāṭ), and it cannot necessarily be taken for\ngranted that Q 7:159 is indeed part of the surah’s original Meccan layer. But a parallel for-\nmulation occurs l ater on in the same surah, in Q 7:181, where there is perhaps less reason\nto entertain Medinan editing: “Among those whom we created there is a community who\nguide according to the truth and act justly according to it.” Here, too, the word ummah is\nused for a group united by a shared religious and ethical outlook.\nVery likely, this use of the word ummah to describe a group of p eople subscribing to\nthe same ethico- religious outlook—i .e., its use in contrast to qawm (Q 7:159) rather than\nas a synonym of it (e.g., Q 10:47 and 16:36)—is informed by the semantics of the Arabic\nroot ʾ-m -m , which imply literal or meta phorical orientation towards, and imitation, of\nsomething or someone. This conjectured connotation certainly fits very well with Q 3:110,\ndiscussed above, where the Qur’anic community is said to be the best ummah “ever brought\nforth for people, enjoining right and dissuading from wrong and believing in God” (cf.\nalso Q 3:104): just as Abraham in his time served as an “exemplar” (imām) “for people”\n(li- l- nāsi), according to Q 2:124 (cf. 16:120, employing the term ummah, and 60:4.6), so\nthe Qur’anic believers too now form an exemplar (ummah) “for p eople” (li- l- nāsi), though\na collective rather than individual one. In a verse like Q 3:110, one may accordingly go so\nfar as to translate ummah not just as “community” but as “communal exemplar” or “model\ncommunity.” Still, this connotative resonance of the term ummah was evidently not stable\nenough in order to prevent the Meccan verse Q 27:83 from deploying the word on precisely\nthe opposite side of the distinction between a community defined by their shared ethnic\norigin and a group defined by their ethico- religious outlook: on the day of judgement,\nGod will assem ble “from every community (ummah, here equivalent to qawm or ethnos)\na group (fawj) of those who used to dismiss our signs as lies.”\nTwo in ter est ing occurrences of ummah that amalgamate the two broad significations\nof the word just distinguished—an ethnic and a religious one— are found in Q 22:34.67. In\nboth verses, which Nöldeke and Schwally assign to the Medinan stratum of Surah 22 (GQ\n1:213; HCI 129), the divine speaker asserts that “for e very community we have appointed\na rite” or mansak (li- kulli ummatin jaʿalnā mansakan; on mansak, see under → dhabaḥa).\nQ 22:34 continues with the rationale “so that they might invoke God’s name over the\nlivestock animals that he has provided for them” (li- yadhkurū sma llāhi ʿalā mā razaqa-\nhum min bahīmati l-a nʿāmi), followed by the reminder that “yourp God is one God, so\nsurrender yourselves to him.” Q 22:34 is surrounded by comments to do with the ḥajj\nritual (see u nder → ḥajja) and the attendant sacrifices, which Q 22:26–29 trace back to\nAbraham and which are clearly understood to be normative for the Qur’anic community\nas well. Especially noteworthy is the fact that Q 22:28, which is part of a divine address to\nAbraham to call p eople to perform the ḥajj, contains a parallel to the segment li- yadhkurū\nsma llāhi ʿalā mā razaqahum min bahīmati l- anʿāmi just cited from 22:34. Thus, Q 22:28\nsays that people are to perform the ḥajj “so that they might witness benefits for them and\ninvoke God’s name, on certain days, over the livestock animals that he has provided for\nthem.” Against this background, the affirmation that God has “appointed a rite (mansak)\nfor every ummah” in Q 22:34.67 underscores that e very community has access to religious,\n90 ummah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The universality of the formulation (li-k ulli ummatin . . .) links it to\nMeccan statements like Q 7:34 ( every ummah has its term) or 10:47 ( every ummah has a\nmessenger). On the other hand, in so far as Q 22:34’s affirmation that every ummah has\naccess to a sacrificial cult that is expressive of mono the ism is embedded in statements to\ndo with the ḥajj, it is clear that the verse presupposes the understanding of Q 2:128.143 that\nMuhammad’s believing followers constitute an ummah in their own right.\nFrom ummah as a “ people” towards ummah as a religious community. A crucial\ntransitional step in the gradual emergence of ummah as a religious rather than ethnic con-\ncept must have been the conclusion of the treaty conventionally termed the “Constitution\nof Medina.” It unites “t hose who believe and surrender themselves [to God] from among\nQuraysh and Yathrib, and t hose who follow them and join them and contend (→ jāhada)\ntogether with them” into “one community to the exclusion of every one else” (ummatun\nwāḥidatun min dūni l- nās; Lecker 2004, §§ 1–2).12 The Medinan ummah founded by this\ndocument is thus a transtribal collective that was not—at least not as far as the Consti-\ntution of Medina allows us to glimpse— undergirded by any explicit claim to kinship or\ncommon descent, but rather a collective united by a shared religious attitude, namely,\nbelief and self- surrender to God, in keeping with the “community that surrenders itself”\nto God (ummah muslimah laka) for which Abraham and Ishmael pray in to Q 2:128.13 The\nchoice of the term ummah at the beginning of the Constitution of Medina resonates with\nQ 7:159, discussed above, and also with the combination of ummah and the adjective “one,”\nwāḥidah, in verses like 10:19.\nNonetheless, at the stage of Muhammad’s Medinan activity that is documented by the\nConstitution, the proto- Islamic ummah does not yet seem to have been a monoreligious\ncommunity: the treaty explic itly includes a number of Jewish clans as forming one “ummah\ntogether with the believers” (but see Lecker 2004, 139–147, in favour of a variant reading)\nand enshrines their right to retain a separate religious cult or manner of worship (→ dīn)\nfrom those who “surrender themselves” to God (§ 28).14 It was only with the violent ex-\npulsion of the Medinan Jews or “scripture- owners,” alluded to in Q 33:26–27 and 59:2–17\n(see under → ˻ahl al- kitāb), that the Medinan ummah became coextensive with the dīn of\nthe Qur’anic believers. As analysed in more detail elsewhere (see under → al-ʿ ālamūn),\nvari ous Medinan passages attribute to this mature Medinan ummah a crucial role in God’s\nplan for humanity at large, consisting in the embodiment of a communal role model of\nbelief and right eousness, in functioning as a sort of light to the nations that w ill make God’s\nrevelatory guidance available even to t hose who are not directly addressed by the “Arabic\n(→ ʿarabī) Qur’an” disseminated by Muhammad (e.g., Q 12:2, 43:3).\nThe Qur’an and the Constitution of Medina reflect the halting crystallisation of a\nconcept of the ummah as a community conceived in primarily religious terms (meaning,\n12 Cf. min dūni l- nās at Q 2:94 and 62:6, and see Ambros 2001, 10.\n13 On the fact that this ummah muslimah is at the same time said to belong to Abraham and Ishmael’s of-\nspring (min dhurriyyatinā), see below.\n14 For a somewhat dif ere nt understanding of § 28 of the Constitution of Medina, see Goudarzi 2019, 435–436:\n“What the text indicates is that these Jews joined hands with the believers to form a larger co ali tion, not that\nthe Jews were a subset of the believers.” I would modulate this by suggesting that the Constitution of Medina\nenvisages a “unitary ummah” (§ 2) that is constituted of Qur’anic believers and Jews. Thus, on my reading, the\nJews, while not being subsumed u nder the Qur’anic believers, are nonetheless part of the overarching ummah\nwhose charter the treaty is.\nummah 91", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic evidence shows that it was entirely pos si ble for the\nterm ummah to be employed in an ethnic sense, but it also establishes that the word\nhad latent connotations of ideological and moral concord, which underwrite its use in\nSurahs 2 and 3 and in the Constitution of Medina. Perhaps this second usage also owed\nsomething to the fact that in Jewish Aramaic the people of Israel— which is after all not\nmerely a community of descent but also a community that has concluded a covenant\nwith God— can be referred to with the Aramaic word uma (Sokolof and Yahalom 1999,\n158, 168, 238 = nos 21:1–2, 25:2, and 39:12). At the same time, one should not exaggerate\nthe degree to which the Medinan conception of the ummah as a community bound\ntogether by a shared religious outlook replaced, rather than complemented, the notion\nof communal affiliation through kinship. After all, post- Qur’anic Muslims continued to\nthink of their religion as intimately bound up with an ethnically Arabic identity for a\nsignificant period of time after Muhammad.15 And even within the Qur’an, the “ummah\nthat surrenders itself to God” for which Abraham and Ishmael pray according to Q 2:128 is\nexplic itly said to be min dhurriyyatinā, “from among our ofspring,” while Q 22:78 calls\nAbraham the believers’ forefather when it speaks of millat abīkum ibrāhīm, “the teaching\nof your father Abraham” (see under → millah and also Goudarzi 2019, 432). Rather than\nviewing the Qur’anic conception of the ummah to be that of a religious community to\nwhich ethnic ties are entirely immaterial, it may therefore be more adequate to under-\nstand the ummah as a community whose members have made a commitment to live up\nto the religious and ritual legacy bequeathed to them by their ancestor Abraham.\nIt is noteworthy, however, that no such claim to descent from Abraham is found in the\nConstitution of Medina. Indeed, seeing that it appears to be exclusively the inhabitants\nof Mecca whom the Qur’an styles as Abraham’s ofspring (Q 14:37), it is unlikely that the\n“helpers” (anṣār) from among Yathrib/Medina’s indigenous population, who formed a sig-\nnificant part of the Medinan ummah together with the Meccan “emigrants” (al- muhājirūn;\nsee Q 9:100.117 and under → hājara), were understood to be descendants of Abraham.16\nThe Medinan ummah therefore seems to have been open to new joiners from outside\nits original Abrahamite kernel, in so far as the Constitution defines the ummah as being\ncomposed not just of “ those who believe and surrender themselves [to God] from among\n15 On Arab identity in early Islam, see generally Webb 2016, though Webb argues that the formation of an\nArab ethnic identity was a result rather than a cause of the emergence of Islam. On this issue, see u nder → ʿarabī.\n16 According to Goudarzi 2019, 480, “the scope of Ishmaelite descent is not entirely clear in the Qurʾān.\nThe Prophet may have envisioned as Ishmaelites 1) all Arabians, 2) the residents of Ḥiǧāz, 3) the population of\nMecca (perhaps together with Medina), or 4) only the Qurayš” (quoted with emended numbering). Goudarzi\nacknowledges that Q 14:37 would seem to favour the third and fourth options, but notes that Mecca may have\nbeen “seen less as an enclave and more as a launching pad for the wider dissemination of Ishmaelites.” Still,\nthe Qur’an lacks any explicit reference to non- Meccan descendants of Ishmael; the mention of “yourp f ather\nAbraham” in Q 22:78 is sufficiently explicable as being based on the Abrahamite descent ascribed to the Meccan\nmembers of the ummah. Th ere is of course the fact that the fifth- century authors Sozomen of Gaza and Theodoret\nof Cyrus mention Arabs who had come to consider themselves descendants of Abraham via Ishmael (Shahîd\n1989, 154–160 and 167–180; Fisher, Wood, et al. 2015, 367–372; Goudarzi 2019, 481, n. 253). But the apparent fact\nthat some tribes in some regions of the late antique Near East had a dopted an Ishmaelite self-u nderstanding, by\ninternalising Biblical genealogy, does not amount to positive evidence that such a genealogical self- definition\nextended across the entire Ḥijāz or the Arabian Peninsula as a whole (which is not, it should be stressed, what\nGoudarzi is arguing). Overall, the appropriately cautious approach is to take Q 14:37 at face value and to consider\nthe Qur’an to posit Ishmaelite descent only for the inhabitants of Mecca (or for some of them).\n92 ummah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, the Medinan ummah, though\nbuilt around an Abrahamite or Ishmaelite nucleus, would seem to have been viewed as in\nprinci ple extendible to anyone who was prepared to pledge himself or herself to its reli-\ngious and behavioural values. This model is borne out by the hymnic opening of Surah 62,\nwhich praises God for having “sent forth among the scriptureless (al- ummiyyūn; → ummī)\na messenger from among them, to recite his signs to them and purify them and teach them\nthe scripture and wisdom, even if they were previously in manifest error” (Q 62:2), and\nthen goes on to stress that Muhammad’s ministry is aimed at “ others among them who have\nnot yet joined them” (Q 62:3: wa-ā kharīna minhum lammā yalḥaqū bihim). One observes\nthat Q 62:3 employs the same verb for joining the Medinan ummah (laḥiqa bi-) that is also\nfound at the beginning of the Constitution of Medina.\nTo put this dialectic interplay of ethical and religious notions of communal belonging\nin a wider context, it is relevant to recall that in the ancient world a person’s ritual or\ncultic allegiances, the gods one worshipped and the way in which one did so, w ere gener-\nally understood to be linked to one’s ethnic identity.18 Although this link between ethnic\nand ritual belonging was disrupted by the spread of gentile Christ ian ity, early Christians\ncontinued to articulate their identity in ethnically tinged terms for some time (BeDuhn\n2015, 253–256; Nongbri 2013, 53–57).19 Even the Christian concept of the “church” (Greek:\nekklēsia, Syriac: ʿēdtā, Christian Palestinian Aramaic: knīshtā), a term already found in the\nNew Testament, mostly with reference to local Christian congregations (e.g., Matt 16:18,\n18:17, Acts 5:11, 8:1, or Rom 16:1.4–5.16.23), is not inherently f ree of ethnic connotations.\nEkklēsia denotes the popu lar assembly of a Greek city, while the New Testamental use\nof ekklēsia in par tic u lar is widely considered to hark back to the Biblical notion of the\n“assembly” (qāhāl) of the Israelites (TDOT 12:546–561; NIDOTTE 3:888–892), a term\nthat the Septuagint often translates as ekklēsia (e.g., Deut 23:2–9, defining who may or\nmay not be admitted to the “assembly of the Lord” = qәhal YHWH, ekklēsia kyriou). The\nevolution of the semantics of ummah in the Qur’an bears witness to a parallel pro cess of\nenunciating religious notions of communal belonging within a cultural context in which\n17 For a dif er ent view, see Goudarzi 2019, 482: “Even if we attribute a ‘universal horizon’ to the Qurʾān’s\nAbrahamic exceptionalism, however, this does not necessarily imply that every one could be a full member of the\nMuslim community— with its characteristic cultic, ritual, and legal correlates— regardless of their genealogical\nbackground.”\n18 On occasion an individual might join a dif er ent ethnos, but in so doing he or she would be assumed to\nacquire the concomitant set of ritual customs, as expressed by Ruth’s famous words to her mother-i n- law: “Your\npeople s hall be my p eople, and your God my God” (Ruth 1:14; see Smith 1894, 35–36). This ancient alignment of\nethnic and ritual affiliation is manifested, for instance, by the use of the term ioudaismos in the second- century\nBCE book of 2 Maccabees, which does not mean “Judaism” in the modern sense of a religion among others but\nrather a drive to reinstate Judaean laws and customs; ioudaismos is loyalty to the ancestral traditions that are\nconcomitant with a Judaean ethnicity, as against hellēnismos, the adoption of Greek ways and customs (Mason\n2007; Nongbri 2013, 46–50).\n19 Thus, 1 Pet 2:9–10 describes Christians as a “chosen race (genos),” a “holy nation (ethnos),” and “God’s\npeople (laos).”\nummah 93", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This makes a unitary understanding of the word\ndistinctly preferable (thus Nöldeke 1860, 10). When Q 7:157–158 call Muhammad “the ummī\nprophet,” then, this is not a comment on his educational attainment.

According to v. 78, some\nof them are “ummiyyūn who do not know the scripture but only wishful thinking; they are engaged in nothing\nbut conjecture” (ummiyyūna lā yaʿlamūna l- kitāba illā amāniyya wa-in hum illā yaẓunnūn). Some of the Israelites,\nwho are supposed to be guided by Moses’s receipt of the scripture (v. 53), are here polemically assigned to the\ncategory opposed to that of the ahl al- kitāb, namely, to that of the ummiyyūn who lack any real acquaintance\nwith scripture. Properly construed, then, Q 2:78 does not pre sent the ummiyyūn as a subset of the Israelites,\nwho belong to the → ˻ahl al- kitāb, but rather presupposes the same opposition between the ahl al- kitāb and the\nummiyyūn that can be gleaned from Q 3:20.75.\n94 ummī", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Against the foregoing argument,\nsomeone seeking to uphold the traditional translation of “the ummī prophet” as “the illit-\nerate prophet” could adduce Q 29:48, which consequently deserves brief comment. The\nverse addresses the Qur’anic Messenger and says that prior to receiving “the scripture”\n(al- kitāb; see v. 47), “youS did not use to recite any kitāb nor write it down with your right\nhand” (wa- mā kunta tatlū min qablihi min kitābin wa- lā takhuṭṭuhu bi- yamīnika). Yet even\non the supposition that this statement is indeed meant to assert Muhammad’s inability to\nread or write, the passage would not s ettle the question of the meaning of the attribute\nummī in Q 7:157–158, considering that the word is absent from 29:48. Moreover, it is ev-\nident that Q 29:48 does not employ the noun → kitāb in the general sense of a piece of\nwriting but rather in the more specific meaning “scripture,” which is undoubtedly what\nthe word signifies in the immediately preceding verses 45–47. Accordingly, the point of\nQ 29:48 is to insist that prior to the beginning of God’s revelations to him, the Qur’anic\nMessenger did not have access to scriptural revelations, leaving him unable to recite or\ntranscribe them.\nA weighty piece of evidence in favour of such a weaker reading of Q 29:48 is 25:5,\nwhere Muhammad’s opponents accuse him of “writing down” or “causing to be written\ndown” the “writs of the ancients” (asāṭīr al- awwalīn), which were allegedly dictated to\nhim “in the morning and the eve ning” (see generally the discussion in Günther 2002,\n7–9). The dispute that may be glimpsed via Q 25:5 and 29:48, therefore, seems to have\nbeen about w hether Muhammad’s preaching was based on genuine revelation or merely\non some form of readerly access to existing religious writings (w hether mediated by ex-\nternal assistance or not). Note, moreover, that the verb talā, employed in Q 29:48 and\ntranslated as “to recite” above, does not simply mean “to read” but rather tends to refer to\nthe audible declaiming of a religious text or the promulgation of divine revelations (see in\nmore detail u nder → qaraʾa). Fi nally, it is entirely plausible to understand Q 29:48 to be\nimplying that while Muhammad did not previously recite any scripture nor write it down,\nGod’s conveyance of “the scripture” to him has now enabled him to do both. That is, just\nas Muhammad is now patently understood to be engaged in “reciting” (talā) a kitāb, so\nhe is now also understood to be engaged in transcribing the scriptural revelations granted\nto him. Thus construed, the verse presumes that in the wake of God’s revelatory address,\nthe Qur’anic Messenger is displaying at least a basic level of literacy. In sum, Q 29:48 is at\nbest immaterial to the question of Muhammad’s illiteracy but could well be adduced in\nfavour of his literacy.\nOn the pre- history of the word ummī.

However, it seems likely to me that even after having been co- opted into Qur’anic\ndiscourse, the Jewish- derived term al- ummiyyūn (see below) would have continued to designate all the nations\nof the world (i.e., Greek ta ethnē) that had not previously been granted scriptural revelations rather than just\nthe Ishmaelite strand of Abraham’s progeny.

Still, this leaves\nopen the very real question of how the word ummī is to be linguistically derived and\nhow it might have come to acquire its Qur’anic valence as the opposite of the scripture-\nowners. It is not unreasonable to assume that ummī is to be connected with → ummah,\n“community” (rather than with umm, “ mother”), but how precisely is this to be squared\nwith the meaning of “scriptureless” that ummī factually has in the Qur’an? The only way\nto shed light on this further question is indeed by means of hy po thet i cal etymological\nreconstruction, though not via ʿam ha-a reṣ.\nThe crucial insight in this regard is due to Horovitz (JPND 190–191; KU 51–53), building\non Wensinck (Wensinck 1924, 191; Wensinck 1932, 6). Horovitz realised that the Qur’anic\nopposition between the ahl al- kitāb and the ummiyyūn is reminiscent of, and quite likely\ndescended from, the Biblical contrast between the people of Israel and “ every people on\nthe face of the earth” (thus Exod 33:16). The same distinction is also reflected in the New\nTestament—f or instance, when Matt 10:5–6 has Jesus instruct his twelve disciples to “go\nnowhere among the gentiles (eis hodon ethnōn, Peshitta: b-ū rḥā d-ḥ anpē)” and to “enter\nno town of the Samaritans,” but rather to go “to the lost sheep of the h ouse of Israel”; or\nwhen Rom 2:14 speaks of “gentiles, who do not possess the [Mosaic] law” (ethnē ta mē\nnomon echonta, Peshitta: ʿammē d- nāmūsā layt lhon).7 Horovitz notes in par tic u lar that in\nrabbinic parlance the gentiles are referred to as the ummot ha- ʿolam, “the nations/peo-\nples of the world” (JPND 190–191; KU 52–53; e.g., b. B. Bat. 10b). The Hebrew expression\nummot ha- ʿolam must have emerged sufficiently early in order to have its literal reflection\nin the Greek formulation ta ethnē tou kosmou in Luke 12:30 (cf.

Given the evident\naffinity of the Qur’anic term ummiyyūn with ummot ha- ʿolam (on which see also Rubin\n1995, 24), one may conjecture that Arabic- speaking Jews in the Qur’anic milieu referred\nto a non- Jew or a gentile— i.e., to a member of the ummot ha- ʿolam—by using the cognate\nword ummī.8 In doing so, Arabophone Jews would have employed an adjective derived\n4 Cf. Jones 2007: “the prophet of his community,” clearly taking ummī to derive from ummah.\n5 The connection is not found in Nöldeke 1860, 10–11, n. 3, so was added by Schwally. On ʿam ha- areṣ in\nrelation to the Qur’anic term ummī, see further Dayeh 2019, 49.\n6 The expression ʿam ha- areṣ certainly does not provide a convincing etymology, given the presence of the\nletter ʿayin in the Hebrew.\n7 See also Luke 2:32, from the prayer of Simeon upon seeing Jesus, which calls God’s salvation as manifest\nin Christ “a light for revelation to the gentiles (ethnōn)” and a “glory to your [= God’s] people Israel.”\n8 Syriac generally expresses “gentile” or ethnikos with the words ḥanpā (de Blois 2002, 21–22 and SL 473; see\nalso under → ḥanīf) and ʿammāyā (SL 1112).

Hence, the adjective ummī would make\nfor an eminently plausible Arabic equivalent of Greek ethnikos in the sense of “gentile,\nnon- Jewish” (Wensinck 1924, 191; Wensinck 1932, 6; see, e.g., Matt 5:47 and 6:7). Within\nrabbinic discourse, this hy po thet i cal pre- Qur’anic meaning of ummī would have corre-\nsponded to Hebrew goy, “gentile” (DTTM 220; see Rosen- Zvi 2016).\nUmmī as a Medinan term. The hypothesis that the Qur’anic term ummī has a Jewish or-\nigin accords well with the fact that Q 3:75 employs al- ummiyyūn in an utterance attributed\nto the ahl al- kitāb. It is also supported by the observation that Qur’anic recourse to ummī\nor ummiyyūn is confined to the Medinan period. This is clear for Surahs 2, 3, and 62, which\nare standardly accepted as Medinan compositions. The only other Qur’anic occurrences of\nthe word ummī are in Q 7:157–158; though Surah 7 as a whole is Meccan, the couplet u nder\nconsideration has been convincingly identified as a Medinan insertion or part of one (GQ\n1:159–160; JPND 222–223; Bijlefeld 1969, 15; O’Connor 2022; see also Pohlmann in Amir-\nMoezzi and Dye 2019, 2:318–320). This is most obviously confirmed by the fact that v. 157 in\npar tic ul ar exhibits a striking concentration of diction that is other wise l imited to Medinan\ntexts, including not only the word ummī but also the names → al- tawrāh (“the Torah”)\nand → al- injīl (“the Gospel”), the verb ʿazzara (“to support, to help,” namely, one of God’s\nmessengers; see Q 5:12 and 48:9 as well as FVQ 213–214), and the noun iṣr (“burden”; see\nQ 2:286 and 3:81).9 Moreover, the distinctly Medinan character of the term al- ummiyyūn is\nthrown into relief by the Meccan verse Q 13:36. It may be read as opposing “t hose to whom\nwe gave the scripture” (alladhīna ātaynāhumu l- kitāba) to al- aḥzāb, meaning p eoples or na-\ntions who have not received scriptural revelation (see in more detail under → ḥizb). Thus,\nprior to the Medinan period the Ethiopic- derived term al- aḥzāb figures in approximately\nthe sense that later on comes to be expressed by the Jewish- derived term al- ummiyyūn.\nGiven that it was in the Medinan period that the Qur’anic community came to have close\ninteractions with a local Jewish community (see u nder → al- yahūd), the fact that ummī is\nso neatly datable to the Medinan period fits the conjecture that the word was originally a\nJewish term, just like the noun → khalāq, referring to a “share” in the afterlife.10\nWhy Qur’anic ummī does not mean “gentile.” A translator wanting to convey the\noriginal Jewish resonance of the word ummī might plump for “gentile” rather than\nby missionaries from the Syriac sphere could have rendered e ither of these words with Arabic ummī, but ummot\nha-ʿ olam is obviously a closer fit. A further consideration in favour of positing that ummī has a specifically Jewish\nbackground is that in the Qur’an the word comes into view only in the Medinan period, which generally seems\nto have been marked by a close confrontation between the Qur’anic believers and a local Jewish community.\n9 Apart from such lexical considerations, O’Connor 2022 also draws attention to the contrast between the\nprophetological assumptions of Q 7:157–158, on the one hand, and the rest of Sura 7, on the other. It remains to\nbe ascertained whether the insertion at hand begins only at v. 157 or e arlier, perhaps including vv. 155–156. It is\nequally unclear, for the time being, how far the addition extends at the other end. Th ere are reasons to suspect\nthat the section on the “tribes” of Israel in Q 7:160–168 is Medinan (→ al- asbāṭ) and the same goes for 7:171–174\n(Hartwig 2008, 192–193). By contrast, the intervening passages Q 7:159 and 7:169–170 could be part of Surah 7’s\noriginal Meccan layer (see also Pohlmann in Amir-M oezzi and Dye 2019, 2:318, noting that Q 7:159 and 7:160 f.\nare unlikely to be part of the same textual stratum due to their dif er ent assessments of the Israelites). But in the\nabsence of a detailed analy sis of the surah’s redactional anatomy, all of this remains conjectural.\n10 According to Horovitz, it was the expression ummot ha- ʿolam that Muhammad learnt from the Me-\ndinan Jews, upon which he coined the word ummī “in accordance with this term” (JPND 191). But since the\nMedinan Jews would presumably have spoken Arabic in their daily life, it seems far more probable that the\nArabic word originated with them.\nummī 97", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, to call Muhammad al- nabiyy\nal- ummī is not to say that he is God’s prophet to the non- Jews but rather God’s prophet to\nthose who are not Jews or Christians. Moreover, at Q 2:78 it would not be apt to render\nummiyyūn as “gentiles”: the verse condemns the Israelites by saying that some of them\nare ummiyyūn “who do not know the scripture” (lā yaʿlamūna l-k itāba). This must mean\nthat some Israelites know so l ittle of their own scripture that they are efectively no better\nthan the scriptureless. The thrust of the accusation is similar to Q 2:101, where some of\n“ those who w ere given the scripture” are accused of casting God’s scripture “ behind their\nbacks.” It seems clear, therefore, that ummiyyūn does not primarily have the ethnic sense\nof “non-I sraelite” at Q 2:78, even though this meaning could punningly be in play as well.\nA functional though f ree translation of Q 2:78, therefore, might run: “And some among\nthem are [efectively] people without scripture, knowing nothing of it but wishful think-\ning; they are only engaged in conjecture” (wa-m inhum ummiyyūna lā yaʿlamūna l-k itāba\nillā amāniyya wa-i n hum illā yaẓunnūn).12 Parenthetically, the combination of ummiyyūn\nand amānin (the plural of umniyyah, “wish”) may be a case of quasi-a lliterative wordplay.13\nAs for Q 7:157–158, rendering al- nabiyy al- ummī as “the prophet of the unscriptured” or\n“the prophet sent to those who have not hitherto received scriptural revelations” coheres\nwell with the stress that Q 29:48 places on Muhammad’s erstwhile lack of access to a kitāb\n(see above).\nIt follows that in adopting the Jewish term ummī, the Qur’an is efecting a significant\nsemantic shift, by converting a word that had previously functioned as the opposite of\n“Israelite” to the opposite of the “scripture- owners” (itself most likely a category coined\nby the Qur’an; see under → ˻ahl al- kitāb). As a result, the emphasis of the Qur’anic use of\nummī is on access to scripture rather than on ethnicity: the Qur’an is not just adopting the\nlexeme ummī but also transforming its meaning from “gentile” or “non- Israelite” to “not\nhitherto endowed with a scripture.” It stands to reason that translators o ught to re spect\nthis shift by rendering Qur’anic ummī as “scriptureless” or the like rather than “gentile.” A\ndefensible exception to this policy is Q 3:75, though, where the plural al- ummiyyūn occurs\nin an utterance attributed to the scripture- owners: “ There is no recourse against us among\n11 On translations that render ummī as “gentile,” see also Dayeh 2019, 48–50. Interestingly, Abdel Haleem\n2010, 105, n. a (on Q 7:157), allows that ummī may mean either “unlettered” or “gentile,” making him one of the\nfew En glish translators reflecting (prob ably indirectly) Horovitz’s point.\n12 Horovitz allows that the meaning of ummiyyūn at Q 2:78 may be informed by ʿam ha- areṣ after all (JPND\n191; KU 53), but this strikes me as uncertain.\n13 That revelation does not conform to h umans’ wishful thinking is a theme pre sent in other Medinan pas-\nsages as well (Q 2:111, 4:123, 22:52, 57:14).\n98 ummī", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Almost all occurrences of the verb āmana in the Qur’an are\nsatisfactorily accounted for by the conventional assumption that its prevalent meaning is\n“to believe,” like that of its Semitic cognates Hebrew heʾӗmîn, Aramaic haymen, and Ethio-\npic amna, corresponding to Greek pisteuein (JPND 191; KU 55–56; FVQ 70–71; Pautz 1898,\n153, n. 2).1 Thus, Qur’anic āmana frequently occurs with a prepositional phrase introduced\nby bi-, which often names God and “the final day” (e.g., Q 2:8.62.126.177.228.232.264, 3:114,\n4:38–39.59, 5:69, 9:18.19 etc.; see Donner 2010, 58–59).2 In other verses, the prepositional\nobjects of āmana consist in divine revelations, “signs,” and messengers, specified either in\ngeneral terms (e.g., Q 2:4.41.85.91.285, 3:53.72.81.84.119.179.199, 4:47.60.152, 6:54.118 etc.)\nor by means of a list of individual prophetic figures, such as at Q 2:136: “Say, ‘We believe in\nGod and what was sent down to us and what was sent down to Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac,\nJacob, and the descendants of Jacob (→ al- asbāṭ), and what was given to Moses and Jesus\nand what was given to the prophets from their Lord; we do not make diferences between\nany of them, and we surrender ourselves to him [= God]” (cf. Q 3:84 and see generally\nDonner 2010, 59–60). A cluster of occurrences of āmana specifically conjoin God and\n“his Messenger,” “the Messenger,” or “the Prophet” (Q 4:136, 5:81, 7:158, 24:47.62, 48:9.13,\n49:15, 57:7–8, 58:4, 61:11, 64:8; → rasūl, → nabiyy). Exceptionally, the prepositional objects\nof āmana can also include the angels (Q 2:177.285). The antonym of āmana is → kafara (bi-) ,\n“to be a repudiator, to repudiate s.o. or s.th.” (cf. the “God and his Messenger” verses just\nlisted with Q 9:80.84, both of which speak of “repudiating God and his Messenger”; see\n1 On the Hebrew and Greek terms, see TDOT 1:292–323, TDNT 6:174–228, and Lindsay 1993. On haymen,\nsee SL 341 and DJBA 379–380.\n2 God can also figure as an object of belief by himself, e.g., in Q 3:110.193, 4:175, or 7:121, while other verses,\nsuch as 6:92.113.150 and 16:22.60, mention only the “final abode” without explic itly including God.\nāmana 99", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

There is also a widespread\nabsolute usage without any prepositional object: “ those who āmanū” or similarly (e.g.,\nQ 2:9.14.25.26), which is an ellipsis.3 The customary equation āmana = “to believe” is fur-\nther supported by the fact that the verb appears with the preposition li- followed by a\nperson, clearly in the sense of “to believe somebody,” as opposed to “in something” (see\nQ 2:55, 3:73.183, 7:134, 10:83, 17:90, 29:26).\nCognitive, affective, and practical dimensions of the Qur’anic concept of belief. It\nhas been noted that in early Qur’anic usage, → ṣaddaqa bi- , “to hold true,” is employed as\nan efective synonym of āmana, “to believe” (e.g., in Q 70:26), although the verb āmana\nis early too (e.g., Q 83:29.34, 84:20). Unlike āmana, this usage of ṣaddaqa bi- fades in later\nproclamations, even if isolated instances of it persist as late as Q 66:12. In any case, the\nsemantic proximity of āmana and ṣaddaqa in the early surahs confirms that the Qur’anic\nunderstanding of belief involves cognitive assent to a certain number of doctrinal prop-\nositions (Ringgren 1951, 11–12). As we just saw, the objects of belief involved in these\npropositions include God (involving presumably his existence and omnipotence and the\ngratitude due to him), God’s Messenger (meaning belief in Muhammad’s prophetic status\nand the truth of the Qur’anic revelations), and the final day (meaning belief in the real ity\nof the resurrection and of the eschatological judgement).\nYet the Qur’anic notion of belief is not confined to such a cognitive dimension (Ring-\ngren 1951, 15). For instance, Q 13:28 associates belief with a state of composure of the heart\n(→ qalb), by referring to “ those who believe and whose hearts are at peace in God’s re-\nminding exhortation” (alladhīna āmanū wa- taṭmaʾinnu qulūbuhum bi-d hikri llāhi; see also\nQ 16:106 and 2:260 as well as Grimme 1895, 118–119, and Bravmann 1972, 27–28). Similarly,\nQ 49:14 makes a distinction between belief as a quality that enters p eople’s hearts, on the one\nhand, and mere outward expressions of self-s urrender (verb: aslama) to God, on the other\n(see in more detail under → aslama). Belief is also paired with trust in or exclusive reliance\nupon God (verb: tawakkala; e.g., Q 5:23, 10:84, 16:99, 42:36, or 67:29; see Ringgren 1951,\n16–17) and with fear of God (→ ittaqā; see Q 2:103, 5:65.93, 7:96, 10:63, 12:57, 27:53, 41:18,\n47:36). Indeed, in Q 2:212 and also 38:28, “t hose who believe” and “t hose who fear God”\n(alladhīna ttaqaw, al- muttaqūn) seem to be employed as downright synonyms. It would\nseem that recognition of an omnipotent divine judge who w ill inescapably hold h umans to\naccount is expected to have a deep emotional resonance within the believer (see generally\nBauer 2017).\nIn this regard, it is illuminating to consider Wilferd Madelung’s attempt to explicate\nthe concept of belief held by al-Ḥ asan al- Baṣrī, who he says identified the “gist of belief”\nwith fear of God, which in turn “must so overwhelm humans as to render them incapable\nof disobeying God’s commandments” (Madelung 1965, 12). With certain qualifications,\nthis is quite aptly carried over to the Qur’an. The Qur’an certainly presumes that t hose\nwho believe are also those who “do righ teous deeds,” as shown by the extremely frequent\nconcatenation of āmana with → ʿamila ˻l-ṣ āliḥāt/ṣāliḥan (e.g., Q 2:25.62.82.277, 19:60.96;\nsee in more detail u nder → ṣāliḥ). To be sure, the Qur’an does not suggest that believers\nare entirely shielded from all moral lapses, and thus considers them to remain in need of\nrepentance and divine forgiveness (→ tāba, → al-r aḥmān).

That belief\nand right eous deeds are intimately connected—w hether at the conceptual level or simply in\nso far as they are psychologically intertwined and equally demanded by the divine judge—\nalso accords with the fact that the verbs → kafara, “to repudiate,” and fasaqa, “to sin, to\nact immorally” are closely associated as well, thus replicating the nexus between belief\nand righ teousness ex negativo (ERCQ 157–162, inter alia citing Q 2:99: only the sinners, al-\nfāsiqūn, w ill repudiate the “clear signs” sent down to Muhammad). Two further behavioural\nconcomitants of genuine belief are assiduous prayer and charitable giving (e.g., Q 2:3.153.227,\n5:55, 9:71, 14:31; see also u nder → ṣadaqah, → ṣallā, and → zakāh).\nSemantic development of Arabic āmana. The consonantal root of the verb āmana,\nʾ- m- n, connotes security (see in detail Ringgren 1951), and the Qur’an still shows traces of a\nnative Arabic usage of the fourth- form verb āmana in the sense “to render secure,” namely,\nin the early Meccan verse Q 106:4 (God āmanahum min khawf, “granted them security\nfrom fear”) and in the Medinan verse Q 59:23 (where God is described as al- muʾmin, “the\none who grants security”). The same sense of āmana is also attested in pre-I slamic poetry\n(DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 5:38, and Zuhayr, no. 3:13, both referenced in Bravmann 1972,\n29; see also Ringgren 1951, 8–9 and 16). By contrast, the predominant meaning of āmana\nin the Qur’an, “to believe,” is likely rooted in the semantic impact of its Aramaic cognate\nhaymen. This is not exclusive to the Qur’an: the Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd describes\nhimself as “somebody whose breast is filled with belief (muʾmin al- ṣadr), hoping to be set\nfree on a day on which a servant will not be treated ungratefully for what he has stored\nup (yawma lā yukfaru ʿabdun mā ddakhkhar)” (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 8:17; see AHW 119).\nIt would appear that at some time before the Qur’an, the Arabic verb āmana came to be\nharnessed to express the Judaeo- Christian notion of belief as an existential commitment\nto, and trust in, God and an espousal of essential religious truths (cf. the discussion of\nHebrew heʾӗmîn in TDOT 1:298–309).\nBy contrast, Bravmann maintains that the Qur’anic usage of āmana is fully explicable\nas an inner-A rabic development, via a posited original meaning of āmana = “to be or feel\nsecure from danger” (Bravmann 1972, 26–31). We saw above that the Qur’an does some-\ntimes highlight that tranquillity of the heart is an integral component of belief (Q 2:260,\n13:28, 16:106, all of which contain both the verb āmana and the verb iṭmaʾanna, “to be or\ncome to be secure” or “to be or come to be at peace,” with the h uman heart as the latter’s\ngrammatical subject; see Bravmann 1972, 27–28). Nonetheless, t here is l ittle positive sup-\nport for Bravmann’s theory, for unlike the causative meaning āmana = “to render secure,”\nthe Qur’an never uses āmana to convey a generic, non- religious sense of feeling secure\nthat approximates the meaning of the first-f orm verb amina (e.g., Q 7:97–99; see also the\ncritique in Ringgren 1951, 8–9). A more likely scenario is therefore the semantic realignment\nof an existing Arabic word u nder the influence of non-A rabic terminology, a phenomenon\nthat linguists call a “loanshift” (see Cole 2019, 408, and Cole 2020, 616).4 This scenario is\nsupported by the fact that the same development is also observable in the case of other key\nQur’anic terms, such as → kafara, “to repudiate,” or → ṣallā, “to pray.”\n4 Note, however, Jepsen’s construal of Hebrew heʾӗmîn as having the basic meaning of “to become steadfast\n(stable)” in TDOT 1:309, which resembles Bravmann’s understanding of the Arabic verb.\nāmana 101", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an frequently employs the verb\nāmana as part of the set expressions alladhīna āmanū, literally “t hose who believe” or perhaps\n“t hose who have espoused belief” (e.g., Q 2:9.14.25.26), and al- muʾminūn, the corresponding\nactive participle plural (e.g., Q 2:285, 3:28). The two phrases, which are efectively synony-\nmous (Reuschel 1996, 143–156), are attested from an early point in the Qur’an’s emergence\n(e.g., Q 83:29.34 and 51:55; see Ringgren 1951, 9). They form the standard Qur’anic desig-\nnation for the community of Muhammad’s followers, as illustrated by Q 2:62, 5:69, and\n22:17 (Ringgren 1951, 1; Donner 2010, 57–58; Dakake 2019, 359–360), even if Muhammad’s\nadherents are on occasion also referred to as “t hose who surrender themselves” or “dedicate\nthemselves” (al- muslimūn; see Q 22:78 and cf. 2:128; → aslama), which came to impose\nitself as the paramount community name in the post- Qur’anic period. In many contexts,\nit would accordingly be appropriate to capitalise “the Believers” in order to signal that the\nexpression functions as a collective name. Nonetheless, the term’s general descriptive con-\ntent remains pre sent throughout, which can create ambiguity. Take, for instance, Q 2:62,\naccording to which “t hose who believe (alladhīna āmanū), and the Jews, the Christians, and\nthe → ṣābiʾūn—w hoever believes in God and the final day (man āmana bi- llāhi wa- l- yawmi\nl-ā khiri) and does right eous deeds, they will have their wage with their Lord and no fear will\nbe upon them and they w ill not know grief.” Like Q 5:69 and 22:17, the verse envisages “the\nbelievers,” or rather “the Believers,” as a concrete collective body distinct from other religious\ncommunities, like Jews and Christians. But the verse then goes on to concede that some of\nthe latter might also qualify as believers. Thus, we have a community whose name is “the\nBelievers,” and we have members of other communities who also count as “believers,” even\nthough they do not belong to “the Believers.” A similar ambiguity is seen with the collective\nexpression “the repudiators” (alladhīna kafarū), which usually designates the Meccan pagans\nbut which can on occasion be used in a more abstract fashion (e.g., Q 98:1.6, referring to\nrepudiating scripturalists and repudiating associators).\nIn cases like Q 2:62, recourse to capitalisation undoubtedly adds clarity, but its\nwholesale application would require a translator to make numerous interpretive choices\nthat are perhaps best addressed at the level of explicit exegesis. For instance, Q 2:8–9 say:\n“And there are some p eople who say, ‘We believe in God and in the final day,’ but they\nare not believers. // They try to deceive God and the believers (alladhīna āmanū), yet\nonly manage to deceive themselves; but they are not aware.” Q 2:8 criticises persons who\noutwardly affiliate themselves with the community of “the Believers,” but lack the crucial\nattribute of sincere belief, as a result of which they are not really “believers.” This is most\nlikely the same Beliver- believer ambiguity seen in Q 2:62, even if it would not be impossible\nto understand the second half of Q 2:8 to say that the persons in question are not really\n“Believers,” i.e., should not be treated as proper members of the Qur’anic community qua\nconcrete social body. But the question w hether to capitalise or lowercase “believers” is even\nmore difficult to decide for the following verse, Q 2:9: it might be read as saying either that\nthe fake Believers just condemned are trying to deceive others who are genuine believers,\nor that they are seeking to deceive the other members of the Qur’anic community of “the\nBelievers.” The dif ere nt between t hese two alternative construals is admittedly very minor,\nsince all members of the Believers who are not frauds will necessarily be genuine believers;\nbut the prob lem remains that it is difficult and perhaps impossible to decide between the\ntwo readings, whereas use of capitalisation for collective terms such as “the Believers” or\n“the Associators” would consistently force a translator’s hand.

The Syriac phrase aylēn da- mhaymnīn, “t hose who believe,” used at 1 Thess 2:13,\ncorresponds exactly to alladhīna āmanū, and the title rēsh da- mhaymnē, “head of the be-\nlievers,” was used for the office of the secular leader of East Syrian Christians (Payne 2015,\n101–102). Especially against the background of the paucity of references to belief in late\nantique rabbinic Judaism, the Qur’an’s diction thus has a tangible affinity with Christian\nusage in this re spect. Of course, Christian references to “the believers” primarily intend\nfaith in Christ (e.g., Eph 1:1), whereas the phrase as repurposed in the Qur’an hinges on\nbelief in God and the last judgement, in divine revelations and messengers in general, and\nin the Qur’anic Messenger in par tic u lar.\namanah | security, a sense of security and calm\n→ sakīnah, → nazzala\namānah | trust, entrusted good\n→ wāthaqa\nal- injīl | the Gospel (corresponding either to the New Testament or to the\nChristian Bible in its entirety)\nFurther vocabulary discussed: al-t awrāh | the Torah nazzala, anzala tr. | to send\ns.th. down hudā | guidance n ūr | light m awʿiẓah | admonition muṣaddiq | con-\nfirming ṣ addaqa tr. | t o fulfil s.th., to make s.th. come true; to confirm or corroborate\ns.th. or s.o. ḥ akama intr. bi - | t o judge according to s.th. a qāma tr. | t o perform or ob-\nserve s.th. m athal | similitude kitāb | scripture ḥ ikmah | wisdom ahl al- kitāb |\nthe scripture- owners, the (previous) recipients of scripture\nEtymology and overview of Qur’anic usage. The word injīl stems from Greek euangelion,\nprob ably not through Syriac but via Ethiopic wangel, which is bisyllabic like the Arabic\nterm (NB 47; KU 71; CQ 24; FVQ 71–72). The name injīl is attested in an Arabic poem\non the creation of the world attributed to the pre- Islamic Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd\nof al- Ḥīrah (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 103:17). Doubts have been raised about the par tic u lar\nverse in question on account of the unlikelihood that a Mesopotamian Christian would\nhave used an Ethiopic loanword for his holy scripture (KU 71 and Toral- Niehof 2008,\n248–249). Nonetheless, at least one scholar deems it pos si ble that the word entered\nArabic at an early date and was then transmitted from the Arabian Peninsula to al- Ḥīrah\n(Dmitriev 2010, 376). For Qur’anic injīl there is also the variant reading anjīl, ascribed\nto al- Ḥasan al- Baṣrī, which is even more similar to Ethiopic wangel (MQ 1:462–463;\nal- injīl 103", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Of course, this\ndoes not necessarily mean that the word was pronounced anjīl by Muhammad and his\nfollowers, who may already have used injīl.\nLike the Torah (→ al- tawrāh), the injīl is exclusively mentioned in Medinan verses; the\ntwo are standardly paired (Q 3:3.48.65, 5:66.68.110, 7:157, and 9:111; see also 48:29).2 The\nQur’an depicts the injīl as a scripture that God “gave” to Jesus (Q 5:46, 57:27), just as Moses\nor David, among o thers, w ere also “given” revelatory texts (e.g., Q 2:53.87, 4:163, 17:55). The\ninjīl’s divine origin is furthermore expressed by statements to the efect that God “taught” it\nto Jesus (Q 3:48, 5:110) or that he “sent down” the injīl and the Torah (Q 3:3.65), just as the\nQur’anic revelations w ere “sent down” (→ nazzala). According to Q 5:46, the injīl contains\n“guidance” (hudā) and “light” (nūr) as well as “admonition (mawʿiẓah) for the God-f earing”\n(see Schmid 2021, 340–341). Similar language is applied both to the Torah, which is said to\nprovide guidance and light (Q 5:44, 6:91), and to the revelations received by Muhammad\n(see Q 4:174, 5:15, 7:157, 42:52, 64:8 on light, and 3:138, 10:57, 11:120, and 24:34 on admoni-\ntion), bearing out the fundamental affinity that the Qur’an discerns between all three texts\n(see Q 3:3 as well as 9:111, briefly discussed below). By way of a further characterisation of\nthe injīl, the phrase “confirming (muṣaddiq; → ṣaddaqa) what precedes me/him/it of the\nTorah” (muṣaddiqan li- mā bayna yadayya/yadayhi mina l-t awrāti), which thrice figures as\nan epithet of Jesus (Q 3:50, 5:46, 61:6), is once applied to the injīl in par tic ul ar (Q 5:46). This\nsuggests that the injīl enshrines Jesus’s message of far- reaching endorsement of the Torah.\nOne may suppose that the Qur’anic injīl is additionally understood to back Jesus’s abolition\nof some of the prohibitions that God had previously imposed on the Israelites (Q 3:50). The\ncontent of the injīl would thus seem to combine a reaffirmation of the Torah’s teachings with\ncertain divinely authorised adjustments.3 The Qur’anic revelations and Muhammad, too,\nare said to confirm “what precedes it” (e.g., Q 6:92) or “what is with” the Israelites (e.g.,\nQ 2:41.89.91.101; see u nder → ṣaddaqa), and some passages make it clear that the scripture\n“confirmed” by the Qur’an is the scripture vouchsafed to Moses (Q 6:91–92, 46:12.30). Thus,\nthe injīl appears to relate to the Torah in the same way in which the Qur’an relates to the\nTorah: both the Qur’an and the injīl are Torah- confirming scriptures.4\nThe contents of the injīl. In light of its etymology, it is customary to translate al- injīl\nas “the Gospel.” Yet it has to be stressed that the Qur’an does not exhibit any palpable\nsense that the injīl narrates the life of Jesus and imparts the “good news” of his ministry:\nJesus receives the injīl rather than constituting its main subject matter. Moreover, the\nQur’an speaks of one injīl rather than four, in light of which van Reeth has argued that the\nQur’anic injīl is to be identified with the Diatessaron, an early Christian harmonisation of\nthe canonical gospels (van Reeth 2004). One verse, Q 5:47, calls upon the “ owners of the\ninjīl”— i.e., the Christians—to “adjudicate according to what God has sent down therein”\n1 I am grateful to Saqib Hussain for bringing this to my attention.\n2 This statement presupposes that Q 7:157 is a Medinan insertion; see also under → ummī.\n3 My understanding of the injīl’s continuity with the Torah specifically in a l egal re spect has benefited from\na paper entitled “Between Triumphalism and Pluralism: The Qur’an’s Legal Philosophy” that Mohsen Goudarzi\ngave at an online workshop entitled “Late Antique Legal Instruction and the Qur’an” on 30 April 2021.\n4 See also the overlap between Q 5:46 and 5:48, which characterise the injīl and the scripture sent down\nto Muhammad as “confirming what precedes it of the Torah” or “confirming what precedes it of the scripture,”\nrespectively.\n104 al- injīl", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This implies that the injīl can serve as a\nbasis for concrete rulings like the Torah (Q 5:43–45) and the Qur’an (Q 5:48–50). It must\naccordingly have some legislative content. The same impression emerges from Q 5:66.68,\ncalling the “scripture- owners” to “perform” or “observe” (verb: aqāma) “the Torah and the\ninjīl and what was sent down to them from their Lord.”5 Incidentally, aqāma in the sense\nof “to perform” or “to observe” normally takes as its object prayer (al- ṣalāh; e.g., Q 5:12.55,\n20:14, 27:3, 29:45, 42:38), which likely reflects Syriac phraseology (see under → ṣallā),\nthough Q 42:13 has aqāma l- dīn, “to observe religious worship (→ dīn2).” It seems quite\nlikely that the phrase “to observe the Torah and the injīl” in Q 5:66.68 is derived from this\nfar more widespread Qur’anic use.6\nMore detailed indications of the content of the injīl are confined to three passages. First,\nQ 7:157, prob ably a Medinan insertion (→ ummī), claims that both the Torah and the injīl\nprophesy the future appearance of a “prophet of the scriptureless,” namely, Muhammad.7\nSecondly, Q 9:111 maintains that the Torah and the injīl, as well as the Qur’an, promise\nparadise to those who give their lives and possession by “fighting on God’s path” and\n“killing and being killed.” Although this claim does not have an explicit New Testamental\nequivalent, it does resonate with late antique Christian invocations of the virtue of mili-\ntant zeal on behalf of God, which are in turn rooted in the Hebrew Bible (HCI 192–196).\nThirdly, according to Q 48:29 the injīl contains a similitude (→ mathal) for Muhammad’s\nfollowers comparing them to a seed growing into a strong plant. This is the only statement\nabout the content of the injīl that distinguishes the injīl from the Torah, which allegedly\ncontains a dif er ent similitude: Muhammad’s followers bear the “trace of prostration” on\ntheir faces. The agricultural character of the first image, and the motif of the growing seed\nin par tic u lar, are reminiscent of some of the parables that are attributed to Jesus in the\nNew Testament, even if the canonical Gospels do not contain any precise counterpart of\nthe Qur’anic mathal (cf. Matt 13:8, as per Buhl 1924a, 5, and Mark 4:27–28, as per CQ 165\nand BEQ 457; see also Rudolph 1922, 19).\nThe injīl = the Christian Bible? The preceding suggests that in seeking to circumscribe\nwhich textual corpus the Qur’anic injīl might be referring to, we should begin by explic itly\nletting go of any assumption that Qur’anic statements about the contents of the injīl must map\nonto a specific and identifiable literary work, w hether that be the New Testament Gospels\nor the Diatessaron. Instead, one does well to allow that Qur’anic statements about the injīl\nare quite likely to reflect the tendency of many Jews and Christians throughout the ages to\nassume that their scriptural canon contains all sorts of l ater interpretations and elaborations\nthat are assumed to be normative but whose anchoring in the text of scripture is at most\ntenuous. For example, it is pos sib le that Q 5:32 pre sents a quotation from the Mishnah as\nbeing contained in the → tawrāh; and a verse like Q 9:111 (see above) similarly suggests that\nthe Qur’an might proje ct onto the injīl (or rather follow the tendency of its addressees to\nproje ct onto the injīl) elem ents of l ater Christian tradition.\n5 Q 5:68 transposes this to the second person plural. As Mohsen Goudarzi has pointed out to me, “what\nwas sent down to them from their Lord” could refer to the Qur’anic revelations (thus, e.g., Ṭab. 8:562–563).\n6 Similarly, Q 2:229.230 have “to observe the limits set by God” (aqāma + ḥudūd allāh).\n7 See also Q 2:129.151, claiming that Abraham prayed for the f uture appearance of Muhammad, and 61:6,\nwhere Muhammad— punningly referred to as a messenger “whose name is most praiseworthy (aḥmad)”—is\npredicted by Jesus.

Accordingly, de-\nspite the prevalent translation of al- injīl as “the Gospel,” it would perhaps be more apposite\nto think of the injīl as corresponding to the entire New Testament—t hough, again, without\ninferring from this that Qur’anic statements about the contents of the injīl must map onto\nspecific New Testamental passages. The proposal that the injīl corresponds, roughly, to the\nNew Testament and what an average Christian con temporary of the Qur’an might have\nassumed it to contain would certainly resonate with the Qur’an’s frequent pairing of “the\nTorah and the injīl,” which is apt to recall the way in which Christians speak of the Old and\nNew Testaments as a bipartite unity. Nonetheless, the Qur’an does not actually provide clear\nevidence that it deems the Christians to possess a two-p art scriptural canon made up of the\nTorah and the injīl.8 Instead, the Torah is expressly associated only with the Israelites or the\nJews (Q 3:93, 5:43–44; see also 62:5, followed by an address of the Jews in 62:6); and even\nthough Jesus is reported to have “confirmed” the Torah (Q 3:50, 5:46, 61:6) or to have been\n“taught” the Torah together with the injīl (Q 3:48: wa- yuʿallimuhu l- kitāba wa- l- ḥikmata wa-\nl- tawrāta wa- l- injīl; 5:110: wa-i dh ʿallamtuka l-k itāba wa-l -ḥ ikmata wa-l -t awrāta wa-l -i njīla),\nthe Christians as a cont emporary collective are nowhere in the Qur’an said to subscribe to\nboth the Torah and the injīl. Rather, Q 5:47 merely calls them “the o wners of the injīl.”\nIt is of course conceivable that the phrase “the owners of the injīl” is simply meant to\nhighlight the distinguishing mark between the Jewish scriptural canon and the Christian\none, consisting as it does in the Christian ac cep tance of a supplementary corpus of scrip-\ntural material in addition to the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament. But given the Qur’anic\nlack of support for associating the Christians with the tawrāh, it is equally pos sib le that the\nexpression “the owners of the injīl” in fact circumscribes the full extent of the Christian\ncanon, in which case the injīl would need to be equated not with the New Testament but\nrather with the Christian Bible in its entirety. From this perspective, even though the injīl\nclearly postdates the Torah, we might think of it not as a sort of sequel to the Torah, to\nbe conjoined with it into a bipartite Christian canon, but rather as an updated re- edition\nof the Israelite scripture: it reprises at least parts of the Israelite Torah, just as the Qur’an\nreprises certain narratives and other content from the Hebrew Bible, yet it also comprises\na degree of divinely mandated supplementation and revision of the Torah, given that\nJesus is said to have abrogated certain previous Israelite prohibitions (Q 3:50). On this\ninterpretation, the scriptural corpus of the Qur’anic Christians w ill be the injīl alone, even\nif the latter in some way replicates or reformulates the Torah. This way of accounting for\nthe relationship between the Torah and the injīl would elegantly accommodate both the\nfact that Q 7:157 and 9:111 imply the Torah and the injīl to have some parallel content and\nthe fact that Q 48:29 entails the simultaneous existence of variant content.9 In fact, Q 9:111\n8 Q 2:113 might be understood to entail that both Jews and Christians are committed to the Mosaic kitāb. If\nso, then Q 2:113 taken together with 5:47, where the Christians are called “the o wners of the injīl,” would yield\na bipartite Christian canon reasonably similar to the Old and New Testament. However, this understanding of\nQ 2:113 is not without alternative; see n. 2 under → ˻ ahl al- kitāb.\n9 Obviously, Q 7:157, 9:111, and 48:29 cannot be assumed to faithfully reflect versions of the Torah and the\ninjīl that actually circulated among Jews and Christians in the Qur’anic milieu.

The hypothesis\njust proposed would also, of course, explain why Q 5:47 calls the Christians “the o wners of\nthe injīl” and why the same verse assumes the injīl to provide a basis for adjudication (cf. also\nQ 5:66.68), although t hese latter two statements by themselves are not incompatible with\nidentifying the injīl only with the New Testament or parts thereof.\nIf the conjecture just formulated is correct, then the Qur’an’s frequent pairing of “the\nTorah and the injīl” should be understood to specify the irreducibly dual shape in which\nthe “scripture” (→ kitāb) that God has “sent down before” the Qur’an (Q 4:136: al- kitāb\nalladhī anzala min qablu) is available in the Qur’an’s own time, namely, as either the Jew-\nish Bible or the Christian one. Of course, according to Q 3:48 and 5:110 Jesus himself was\ntaught both the Torah and the injīl, in addition to “the scripture”— presumably the celes-\ntial scripture on which both the Torah and the injīl are based (see under → kitāb)— and\n“wisdom” (→ al-ḥ ikmah).

In line with an argument by Saqib Hussain, the expression ahl al- kitāb— usually\ntranslated as “the p eople of the scripture” in English—is best rendered simply as “scripture-\nowners” or “recipients of the scripture.”1 The Medinan surahs frequently employ ahl al-\nkitāb and the synonymous periphrasis “ those who were given the scripture” (alladhīna\nūtū l-k itāba) as umbrella terms referring to Jews and Christians in their capacity as the\ninheritors of earlier scriptural revelations, with all the concomitant commonalities this\nmight involve (such as the recitation of scripture in prayer and worship, and exegetical\nrecourse to scripture in order to ground doctrinal truth- claims). Only one occurrence\nof the term ahl al- kitāb is found in a Meccan surah (Q 29:46), and the respective verse is\nvery likely a Medinan insertion (see the excursus below). Nonetheless, as shown below,\nthe use of ahl al- kitāb in Medinan surahs does need to be placed against the background\nof terminological developments in the Meccan portions of the Qur’anic corpus. While\nthe concept of scripture is well attested in pre- Qur’anic traditions, there appears to be no\npre- Qur’anic antecedent specifically for the term “scripture- owners” (Künstlinger 1928,\n246). Hence, the expression ahl al- kitāb may well be a Qur’anic coinage, drawing on the\nQur’an’s complex understanding of the category of scripture (→ kitāb).\nAs Devin Stewart points out, the Qur’an does not apply the expression ahl al- kitāb to\nthe Qur’anic believers, despite the fact that there are passages in which the Qur’an itself is\ncalled a kitāb (Stewart 2021, 59; e.g., Q 2:89, 6:92, 46:12). This could indicate that the ahl\nal- kitāb are not just possessors of scripture in general—w hich is, a fter all, a category that\nought to include the Qur’anic community alongside Jews and Christians— but rather that\nthe ahl al- kitāb are to be understood as the bearers of the Mosaic scripture in par tic ul ar, in\nline with Qur’anic references to “the scripture brought by Moses” (Q 6:91: al- kitāb alladhī\njāʾa bihi mūsā) or “the scripture of Moses” (Q 11:17, 46:12: kitāb mūsā). Stewart accordingly\nrecommends that ahl al- kitāb be translated as “the p eople of the Bible.” Yet one should\nperhaps be cautious to attribute to the Qur’an the seemingly self- evident assumption that\nJews and Christians share a substantial part of their scriptural canon, in the form of the\n1 See Hussain 2022b, 136, n. 11. Hussain compellingly argues that an expression such as ahl al- shāʾ ought to be\ntranslated as “ owners of sheep” (DSAAP, 205, no. 27:1, attributed to Imruʾ al- Qays). His own preferred rendering\nis “ those with scripture.” Note that in German-l anguage scholarship, Schriftbesitzer has long been an established\nequivalent of ahl al- kitāb (e.g., GQ 1:156).\n108 ahl al-k itāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As for the fact that the\nQur’anic believers are never included in the category of ahl al- kitāb, it w ill be suggested\nthat this is satisfactorily explicable by positing that the phrase ahl al- kitāb functions as an\nabbreviation of temporally indexed expressions such as “t hose to whom the scripture was\ngiven beforehand” (Q 57:16: lladhīna ūtū l-k itāba min qablu), “t hose to whom we gave the\nscripture before it” (Q 28:52: alladhīna ātaynāhumu l-k itāba min qablihi), and “t hose who\nrecite the scripture before youS” (Q 10:94: alladhīna yaqraʾūna l- kitāba min qablika).\nMeccan references to previous recipients of divine revelation. In the Meccan surahs,\nthe proprietors of earlier scriptural revelations are referred to by a range of dif er ent\ncircumlocutions. These include “the recipients of reminding exhortation” (ahl al-d hikr,\nQ 16:43 = 21:7; → dhakkara) and “t hose to whom knowledge was given before it” (alladhīna\nūtū l-ʿ ilma min qablihi, Q 17:107), namely, before the Qur’anic revelations (which are men-\ntioned in the preceding verse, Q 17:106). According to Q 17:107–109, “t hose to whom knowl-\nedge was given before it fall down on their chins” in tears and glorify God when Muhammad’s\nrevelations are recited to them. As regards the ahl al- dhikr, the doublet Q 16:43 = 21:7 instructs\nthe Qur’anic addressees to consult them should they “not know” that all previous messengers\nsent by God were human. The positive light in which all three passages (Q 16:43 = 21:7 and\n17:107–109) place the recipients of e arlier revelations forms a notable contrast with the much\nmore polemical tone struck in many Medinan statements.\nThe same observation holds true for the most frequent Meccan phrase referring to the\npossessors of e arlier revelations, namely, “t hose to whom we gave the scripture” (alladhīna\nātaynāhumu l- kitāba; Q 6:20.89.114, 13:36, 28:52, 29:47). These recipients of the scripture\nare clearly assumed to be distinct from the Meccan Qur’an’s primary addressees, namely,\nthe “believing” (→ āmana) followers of Muhammad and their “associating” (→ ashraka)\nor “repudiating” (→ kafara) opponents. As has been thoughtfully noted, such references\n2 The weightiest potential prooftext in support of the supposition that the Qur’an does consider Jews\nand Christians to share a significant portion of their scriptural canon is Q 2:113. The verse criticises the Jews\nand Christians for rejecting each other as having no ground to stand on “even though they both recite the\nscripture” (wa-h um yatlūna l-k itāba)— that is, despite reciting, or perhaps claiming to recite, one and the\nsame scripture. Goudarzi aptly summarises the verse by saying that it “deems the antagonism between Jews\nand Christian absurd, because they read the same scripture yet attribute profoundly dif er ent teachings to\nit” (Goudarzi 2018, 246, n. 129), and he appears inclined to infer from this that al- kitāb must mean the Mosaic\nscripture here. Devin Stewart is similarly persuaded that al- kitāb must mean the Bible in this passage (Stewart\n2021, 62). Yet a dif er ent interpretation is feasible: the assertion that Jews and Christians recite “the scripture”\nmight simply proceed from the Qur’anic vantage point that both the Torah and the injīl derive from the same\ncelestial archetype—a transcendent scripture in which the Qur’an takes all Jewish and Christian claims to having\nreceived divine revelation to be ultimately grounded (but of which Jews and Christians are by no means deemed\nfaithful expositors). In other words, the scripture that is common to Jews and Christians and in light of which\ntheir mutual denunciations appear as spiteful and unfounded bickering is not necessarily any earthly document.\nQ 2:113 does not therefore provide unequivocal evidence that the Qur’anic Christians have a scriptural canon that\nincludes the Jewish Torah (which is not to rule out that the Qur’anic → injīl might be understood as an updated\nand expanded re- edition of the Torah).\nahl al-k itāb 109", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

At Q 10:94, it is the Qur’anic Messenger himself who is bidden\nto ask “t hose who recite the scripture before youS” (alladhīna yaqraʾūna l- kitāba min qa-\nblika) should he be “in doubt about what we have sent down to you,” presumably so that\nthe scripture- reciters can allay such doubts: “the truth from yourS Lord has come to you,\nso do not be one of t hose who harbour misgivings,” the verse continues. One might query\nwhether such statements must necessarily reflect factual recognition of the Qur’anic proc-\nlamations by con temporary scripture- bearers: could they be confident posits, designed\nto bolster the credibility of the Qur’anic Messenger in the context of polemical disputes\nwith his Meccan opponents? Still, some of the relevant material resists such a reading\n(e.g., Q 28:52–53, 46:10), making it quite plausible that already in the Meccan period t here\nwas direct contact between the Qur’anic community, on the one hand, and individual\nscripture- bearers, on the other (see in more detail under → isrāʾīl).\nIn verses referring to “t hose to whom we gave the scripture,” the kitāb in question is\nprob ably the celestial scripture that the Qur’an depicts as the archetypal source both of the\n“scripture of Moses” (kitāb mūsā; Q 11:17 and 46:12; see also 6:91) and of the revelations\nimparted to Muhammad, which despite their oral and serial mode of delivery are likewise\nconceptualised as “a scripture” (Q 6:92.155, 46:12.30; → kitāb). That these two earthly\nscriptures are manifestations of a joint celestial archetype is illustrated, for instance, by\nutterances that Q 6:156–157 counterfactually place in the mouth of the Qur’anic believers:\nGod has sent down the scripture lest the believers should say that “the scripture was only\nsent down upon two factions before us” (innamā unzila l- kitābu ʿalā ṭāʾifatayni min qa-\nblinā), an allusion to Jews (→ al- yahūd) and Christians (→ al- naṣārā), and lest they should\nsay, “If only the scripture had been sent down upon us, we would have been better guided\nthan they.” It seems clear that it is one and the same transcendent scripture here that is\nfirst revealed to Jews and Christians and subsequently to the Qur’anic believers. Although\nit is acknowledged that Jews and Christians— neither of whom are explic itly named in\nthe Meccan Qur’an— have real access to the celestial scripture, access that is anchored in\npast revelations, they are not its exclusive proprietors anymore, as the scripture has now\nbecome available to the Qur’anic community as well.\nAn extended list of past individuals who w ere granted revelatory insight into “the scrip-\nture” is given in Q 6:89, where the label “t hose to whom we gave the scripture, judgement,\nand prophecy” includes past prophets such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, and\nSolomon, featuring in vv. 83–86, in addition to “some of their forefathers and their ofspring\n(dhurriyyāt) and their brothers” (v. 87). That pre sent scripture- bearers are genealogically\ndescended from the recipients of prior divine revelations similarly follows from Q 40:53.\nThe verse maintains that God “gave the scripture as an inheritance to the Israelites” (wa-\nawrathnā banī isrāʾīla l- kitāb), implying that knowledge of the scripture is passed down\n110 ahl al-k itāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Having access to the scripture by means of bequeathal and tradition does\nnot therefore preclude falling into “disquieting (murīb; → irtāba) doubt about it” (Q 42:14;\ncf. the doublet 11:110 = 41:45, also denouncing the emergence of “disquieting doubt” sub-\nsequent to Moses’s receipt of the scripture).5\nMedinan developments. In the Medinan period, the variegated Meccan spectrum\nof expressions designating proprietors and inheritors of previous scriptural revelations\nundergoes a noticeable degree of formulaic standardisation. The succinct term ahl al-\nkitāb, “scripture- owners,” now establishes itself as dominant, especially in Surahs 2–5\n(Q 2:105.109, 3:64.65.69.70.71.72.75.98.99.110.113.199, 4:123.153.159.171, 5:15.19.59.65.68.77).\nIn parallel, the Medinan employs the passive periphrasis “ those who were given the\nscripture” (alladhīna ūtū l- kitāba; e.g., Q 2:101.144.145, 3:19.20.100.186.187, 4:47.131, 5:5.57,\n9:29)6 and its less favourable variant “ those who were given a portion (naṣīb) of the scrip-\nture” (Q 3:23, 4:44.51: alladhīna ūtū naṣīban mina l- kitābi). “ Those to whom we gave\nthe scripture” (alladhīna ātaynāhumu l-k itāba) also continues to occur, though only in\nQ 2:121.146. The seemingly equivalent usage of ahl al- kitāb and of “t hose who (alladhīna)\nwere given (a portion of) the scripture” corresponds to the interchangeable employment\nof al- muʾminūn (“the believers”) and alladhīna āmanū or of al- mushrikūn (“the associa-\ntors”) and alladhīna ashrakū. As suggested above, a pos si ble reason why the category of\nthe ahl al- kitāb never includes the Qur’anic community is that Medinan references to the\n“scripture- owners” function as a conventional abbreviation for t hose to whom God has\ngiven the scripture “before it” (min qablihi, Q 28:52; cf. also 10:94), namely, before the\nQur’anic revelations. That this temporal qualifier is still very much implicit in Medinan\nstatements about the scripturalists is confirmed by several verses in which the periphrastic\n“t hose who w ere given the scripture” is unequivocally expanded by “before youp” or s imple\n“before” (min qablikum, min qablu; Q 3:186, 4:131, 5:5.57, 57:16).\nAlthough the Medinan surahs make explicit mention of the Jews (→ al- yahūd, alladhīna\nhādū) and Christians (→ al-n aṣārā), the abstract terms “scripture- owners” and “ those\nwho were given the scripture” are nonetheless more frequent. This likely indicates the\nMedinan Qur’an’s comparative lack of interest in doctrinal or ritual features specific to\neither Judaism or Chris tian ity, and its corresponding preoccupation with behaviours and\n3 Cf. also Q 26:196–197, which may be understood to presume that “the learned ones from among the Isra-\nelites (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl)” are familiar with the “ancient writings” (zubur al- awwalīn; → zabūr) and are thus able\nto confirm the Qur’anic revelations’ correspondence with earlier revelations.\n4 Note that the question of the extent of potential Medinan additions to Surah 7 has not yet been settled.\n5 On Meccan passages that are implicitly critical of Jews and Christians, see also HCI 178.\n6 Alladhīna ūtū l- kitāba also figures in Q 74:31, which is a Medinan insertion (see, e.g., Sinai 2017c, 73–75).\nahl al-k itāb 111", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 3:75, for example, attributes to the ahl al- kitāb an utterance in which the\nterm al- ummiyyūn, “the scriptureless” or “the gentiles” (→ ummī), appears to operate as\nan umbrella term for outsiders, which is redolent of Jewish usage. Q 4:171, meanwhile,\nopens with a vocative addressed to the “scripture- owners” and then stresses that Jesus\nwas no more than a messenger, followed by an apparent rejection of the doctrine of the\nTrinity. Another passage in which “t hose who w ere given the scripture” has been argued\nto stand for the Jews in par tic u lar is Q 5:5, which permits to the members of the Qur’anic\ncommunity “the food of those who were given the scripture” (see Griffith 2007, 87*, n.\n18; Griffith 2011, 315–316) and vice versa.8\nOverall, Medinan references to the scripturalists are considerably more polemical\nand confrontational than their Meccan counter parts. For instance, Q 2:146 chastises a\ngroup (farīq) of scripture- owners for knowingly “concealing” (katama) the truth (see\nalso Q 3:71.187; on concealment in connection with the Israelites, see, e.g., 2:42.72), and\nother Medinan passages accuse the scripturalists of “hiding” (akhfā) parts of the scrip-\nture (Q 5:15),9 of “casting” (nabadha) the scripture “ behind their backs” (Q 2:101, 3:187),\nof fabricating scriptural revelations (Q 3:78; cf. 2:79), and of general untrustworthiness\n(Q 3:75). The impression that the scripture- owners cannot be relied upon to be sincere\ncustodians of the revelatory deposit entrusted to them is further heightened by Q 5:68,\nreprimanding them that “youp have no ground to stand on until you observe the Torah\nand the Gospel and what was sent down to you from your Lord” (lastum ʿalā shayʾin ḥattā\ntuqīmū l- tawrāta wa- l- injīla wa- mā unzila ilaykum min rabbikum; cf. also Q 5:66).\n7 For a dif er ent emphasis, see Pregill 2020, 37, who suggests that the Qur’anic preference for the term ahl\nal- kitāb over references to Jews and Christians “at least partially reflects the indeterminate origins of traditions\nin circulation in the Arabian environment; t hese traditions could exhibit a difusely scripturalist character but\nperhaps lacked a more specific communal inflection.”\n8 Crone has objected that it would have been inappropriate in a legislative context for the Qur’anic Mes-\nsenger to employ “a term bracketing Jews and Christians if he meant the Christians to be excluded” (QP 240).\nI have myself proposed an interpretation of Q 5:5 that would consider the expression “ those who were given\nthe scripture” here to encompass both Jews and Christians, and thus to permit the Qur’anic believers to refrain\nfrom vetting Christian food for its conformity to the Qur’anic prohibition of pork (Sinai 2017c, 85–89). Such\nrelaxedness about strict adherence to the prohibition of pork would tally with a certain tendency in the Medinan\nsurahs to de- emphasise the ultimate significance of the literal and unfailing observance of specific behavioural\nrules— a tendency embodied by the exemptive clauses in Q 5:3.6, which u nder certain circumstances suspend\nthe Qur’an’s dietary rules and the requirement of ablution before prayer (see Sinai 2019c and under → ṭahara),\nor by Q 2:177.189, which emphasise that right eous conduct (al- birr) is not to be conflated with per for mance of\ncertain external rites (see under → dhabaḥa). Nonetheless, I would now acknowledge more readily that verses\nlike Q 3:75 and 4:171 lend support to Griffith’s proposal. But note that later on in the same surah, in Q 5:68, the\n“scripture- owners” clearly encompass both Jews and Christians, given that the scripture- owners are exhorted\nto “observe the Torah and the Gospel.”\n9 The accusation of hiding portions of scripture also appears in Q 6:91, although the interlocutors t here might\nbe understood to be the Meccan pagans, given that the verse begins by accusing the opponents of maintaining\nthat “God has not sent down anything upon a mortal” (QP 110–111; see also under → ashraka). According to\nNöldeke and Schwally, the verse may well be Medinan (GQ 1:161–162), but this is based on their ac cep tance of\nthe standard exegetical view that the relevant part of the verse is directed against the Jews (see QP 111).\n112 ahl al-k itāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 33:26, too, refers to violent conflict with local scripture-\nowners: “some of them youp killed, and some of them you captured” (farīqan taqtulūna\nwa-t aʾsirūna farīqā). Very few details of the conflict may be ascertained from the Qur’an\nitself, although one learns that the Medinan scripturalists enjoyed support from other\nsections of the Medinan population (Q 59:11–12) and that the fighting involved the de-\nstruction of houses (Q 59:2) and the cutting- down of palm trees (Q 59:5) as well as\ncaptives and casualties (Q 33:26, just cited). In the wake of the conflict, the Qur’anic\nbelievers appropriated the scripturalists’ land, dwellings, and possessions (Q 33:27;\ncf. 59:6). Fi nally, one verse, Q 9:29 (discussed under → jāhada), enjoins the Qur’anic\nbelievers to exact tribute from unbelieving scripturalists who have been fought and\nsubjugated. In so far as this manner of proceeding— subjugation in situ in return for\ntribute, rather than expulsion and expropriation— difers from the fate that seems to\nhave befallen the Medinan scripture- owners, it may be that Q 9:29 is looking further\nafield, at scripturalist populations outside Medina, and that the verse is to be dated after\nthe events alluded to in 33:26 and in Surah 59.\nDespite the Medinan polemics against the “scripture- owners” and the hostilities to\nwhich such condemnations eventually gave rise, there is nonetheless some nuance in the\nMedinan material. Q 2:62 and 5:69 are unequivocal in affirming the possibility of salvation\nfor Jews and Christians, even if this presumably requires them to accept the principal\nQur’anic doctrines, including the Qur’ans rigorous understanding of mono the ism, and to\nrecognise Muhammad’s prophetic authority (see in more detail under → aslama). Q 3:64\naccordingly invites the scripture- owners to “come to a word common between youp and\nus,” consisting in unadulterated mono the ism (of which the mainstream Christian under-\nstanding of Christ as God’s son and as a member of the Trinity would presumably fall foul;\nsee Q 4:171, 5:72–77.116). Q 5:59 shows how this common- denominator approach can be\ngiven an openly polemical turn: “SayS, ‘O scripture- owners, do you resent us for anything\nother than the fact that we believe in God and what was sent down to us and what was sent\ndown before, and that most of you are sinners?’ ” The ecumenicalism expressed by Q 2:62\nand 5:69 therefore comes with conditions attached. It is, nonetheless, not presented as\nmerely a theoretical possibility, for some of the scripturalists in the Qur’an’s environment\nare indeed considered to qualify as genuine believers (Q 3:110.113–115.199, 4:162, 5:66). At\nthe same time, other scripture- bearers, perhaps even “many of them” or “most of them”\n(Q 5:66 and 3:110; see also 5:59), are branded as repudiators (Q 2:105, 59:2.11, 98:1.6) and\nas sinners (Q 3:110, 5:59).\nIn the Medinan surahs, then, the “scripture- owners” appear as a distinctly mixed and\nambivalent bag, as a group who include both believers like Muhammad’s followers und re-\npudiators like his pagan opponents, with more or less emphasis on the latter. This mixed- bag\nview of the “scripture- owners” is in fact pre sent as early as the Meccan statement Q 35:32,\npartially cited above, which sets out a tripartite ethico- religious taxonomy of those who\nwere “given the scripture as an inheritance”: they include t hose who “wrong themselves”\n(fa- minhum ẓālimun li- nafsihi), those who are “middling” or “moderate” (wa-m inhum\nahl al-k itāb 113", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The renewed uptake of the attribute muqtaṣid\nin Q 5:66, which concedes the existence of a “middling community” (ummah muqtaṣidah)\namong the scripture- owners (i.e., a group who are at least not downright unbelievers),\nillustrates how the diferential approach of Q 35:32 continues to resonate in the Medinan\nperiod, despite the latter’s more confrontational attitude towards the scripture- bearers.11\nThe Medinan increase in stridency towards the scripture- owners is reasonably ex-\nplained by the assumption that following the hijrah the Qur’anic community came to\nencounter a rivalling community of scripturalists at close quarters. Unlike Meccan inter-\nactions with Jews and/or Christians, which may have been confined to individuals, this\nMedinan encounter generated significant polemical pressure and engendered a much\nmore disapproving attitude to the beliefs and practices of the scripture- owners, even if\nthe Meccan Qur’an is not entirely devoid of critical remarks regarding the inheritors of\nthe scripture either (e.g., Q 42:14). Thus, the Medinan arraignment of the scripturalists\nand the Israelites for malicious concealment of God’s truth would seem to respond to\nthe fact that at least some of the Medinan scripture- owners did not in fact “believe” or\n“rejoice” in the Qur’anic revelations, as posited by sundry Meccan verses. Especially if it\nis assumed that, as the Medinan addition Q 7:157 maintains,12 Muhammad’s appearance\nis predicted in the Torah and in the Gospel (see also Q 48:29 and 61:6), accusations of\ndeliberate concealment ofered a ready explanation for scripturalist reluctance to acknowl-\nedge Muhammad’s claim to prophecy (Rubin 2003a, 25). It should be borne in mind that\nthe need to supply credible rejoinders to the Medinan scripturalists was not an academic\nprob lem but would have been of crucial importance in avoiding a dissipation of Muham-\nmad’s prophetic authority under post- hijrah conditions (HCI 196–209). As attested by\nQ 2:109 and 3:69.99–100 (cf. also 3:69), there must have been a real danger that some of\nthe scripture- owners, who would undoubtedly have possessed significant prestige in the\neyes of the Qur’anic believers, would cause the latter to “revert to being repudiators\nafter having espoused belief” (Q 2:109 and 3:100: yaruddūnakum min baʿdi īmānikum kuf-\nfāran / yaruddūkum baʿda īmānikum kāfirīn).\nExcursus: A Meccan Occurrence of the Term ahl al- kitāb in Q 29:46?\nThe only occurrence of the expression ahl al- kitāb in a Meccan surah is found in Q 29:46.\nThe pre sent version of Q 29:46 has been suspected of being the result of Medinan revision\n(Nöldeke 1860, 116; GQ 1:155–156), leading one scholar to state categorically that “ahl al-\nkitāb is only found in Medinan surahs” (Künstlinger 1928, 238). Given that it is of some\n10 Q 31:32, where the attribute muqtaṣid seems to refer to t hose who renege on their commitment to worship\nGod alone (mukhliṣīna lahu l-d īna), suggests that muqtaṣid— which in Q 35:32 functions as a term of distinctly\nfaint praise— can also have a negative sense.\n11 See also Q 7:159 (among the people of Moses is a community, ummah, “who guide according to the truth\nand act justly according to it”), which should be compared with 3:113 and 5:66. The distinction between Meccan\nand Medinan material in Surah 7 requires further study, however (see u nder → ummī and n. 2 under → al-\nasbāṭ). For another instance of Meccan-M edinan continuity in phraseology associated with the scripture- owners,\ncf.

Whether or not v. 46 is a later\ninsertion, the component verses of the sequence are in many re spects tightly enmeshed:\nthe section is bracketed by occurrences of al-s amāwāt wa-l -a rḍ, “the heavens and the\nearth,” in v. 44 and v. 52, and further integrated through multiple recurrences of several\nterms and phrases.13 The passage commences with an affirmation that God’s creation of the\nheavens and the earth is a “sign (āyah) for the believers” (v. 44), followed by a command\nto the Messenger to “recite” (utlu) “what has been conveyed to youS of the scripture” (mā\nūḥiya ilayka mina l- kitābi; v. 45) and to perform prayer.\nV. 46, the verse containing the expression ahl al- kitāb, then shifts to the second person\nplural and thus would seem to turn to the Qur’anic community at large: “Only disputep\nwith the scripture- owners (ahl al- kitāb) in the best manner (bi- llatī hiya aḥsanu), except\nfor t hose of them who are guilty of wrongdoing (illā lladhīna ẓalamū minhum).” What this\n“best manner” consists in is fleshed out in a creed- like statement underscoring the Qur’anic\ncommunity’s recognition of revelations formerly imparted to the scripturalists: “Sayp, ‘We\nbelieve in what was sent down to us and was sent down to youp; our God and your God is\none, and we surrender ourselves to him.’ ” The intended efect of this prescribed utterance\nmay have been to engender rhetorical pressure on the scripture- owners to match what one\nmight call the Qur’anic believers’ revelatory dimorphism and to corner them into extend-\ning equivalent recognition to Muhammad’s revelations. Alternatively, the utterance could\nhave been meant as a conversation-s topper, efectively clarifying that the “best manner” of\ndisputing with the scripturalists consists in not d oing too much disputing at all, but rather\nin stating one’s convictions and avoiding being drawn into further debate.\nIn v. 47, the divine voice returns to the second person singular, claiming that the\nscripture- bearers believe in the Qur’anic revelations: “Thus we have sent down the scrip-\nture to youS, and t hose to whom we gave the scripture believe in it; and among t hese p eople\nhere (wa- min hāʾulāʾi) are some who believe in it; our signs are only denied by the repudia-\ntors (wa- mā yajḥadu bi-ā yātinā illā l- kāfirūn).” In this verse, the phrase min hāʾulāʾi— which\nI have translated “among t hese p eople here,” following Birnstiel 2010, 172— must refer to a\ngroup who are dif er ent from the scripture- bearers, since the statement that “min hāʾulāʾi\nare some who believe in it” would other wise partially duplicate and partially clash with\nthe immediately preceding affirmation that “ those to whom we gave the scripture believe\nin it.” Plausibly, the demonstrative hāʾulāʾi intends the general audience of the Meccan\nsurahs, some of whom espoused belief in Muhammad’s revelations.14 Verse 48 continues\n13 Notably, āyah/āyāt, “sign/signs,” in vv. 44, 47, 49, and 50 (with vv. 47 and 49 also sharing the entire phrase\nmā yajḥadu bi- āyātinā illā . . . , “our signs are only denied by . . .”); the verb talā, “to recite” + kitāb, “scripture,”\nin vv. 45, 48, and 51; the verb ẓalama, “to do wrong,” and al-ẓ ālimūn, “the wrongdoers,” in vv. 46 and 49; several\noccurrences of the verbs āmana, “to believe,” in vv. 46, 47, and 52, and anzala, “to send down,” in vv. 46, 47, 50,\nand 51; and the root b-ṭ - l in vv. 48 (al- mubṭilūn, perhaps “t hose who declare [God’s revelations] to be void”) and\nv. 52 (“ those who believe in what is void, al- bāṭil”).\n14 Cf. Muqātil 2002, 3:386, explaining that this segment of the verse refers to “the Muslims of Mekka,” and\nal- Zamakhsharī’s gloss “from among the Meccans” (min ahli makkah; Zam. 4:554).

In v. 49, the passage reaches a preliminary conclusion when\n“it”— namely, the Qur’anic revelations—is characterised as “clear signs (āyāt bayyināt) in\nthe breasts of those endowed with knowledge”; the verse ends in a final flourish similar\nto v. 47 (“our signs are only denied by the wrongdoers,” wa- mā yajḥadu bi- āyātinā illā l-\nẓālimūn). Verses 50–52 then cite and respond to an objection by opponents that picks up\nthe concept of divine signs, also invoked in vv. 44 and 49: “They say, ‘Why have no signs\nfrom his Lord been sent down upon him?’ ”—to which the Messenger is ordered to reply\nthat “the signs are with God” and that he is only a warner. Verse 51 reasserts that God has\n“sent down upon youS the scripture so that it is recited to them,” while v. 52 closes out the\nwhole sequence with another qul command addressed to the Messenger.\nIn contending that v. 46 is a Medinan addition, Nöldeke highlights that the injunction\nto “dispute” with the “scripture- owners” (ahl al-k itāb) “in the best manner, except for\nthose of them who are guilty of wrongdoing” implies that the wrongdoers among them\nmay be fought, a view that is allegedly inconceivable before the hijrah (Nöldeke 1860,\n116). This is hardly convincing: it it is entirely pos si ble that the point of v. 46 is merely\nthat disputing with wrongdoing scripturalists is futile and should therefore be avoided.15\nNöldeke further argues that v. 46’s status as a secondary addition is indicated by its tension\nwith v. 47, according to which “ those to whom we gave the scripture” do in fact believe\nin the Qur’anic revelations. This second argument is far more plausible, since the credal\nformula that the Qur’anic believers are ordered to utter in Q 29:46 (“Sayp, ‘We believe\nin what was sent down to us and was sent down to youp . . .’ ”) does seem to be designed\nto corner scripturalists who did not readily profess belief in “what was sent down to” the\nQur’anic community. Thirdly, a footnote reminds Nöldeke’s readers that the phrase ahl\nal-k itāb is not other wise attested in Meccan surahs, the implication being that v. 46 is\nterminologically out of character. This, too, is pertinent, though of course not conclusive,\nsince one cannot rule out that v. 46 forms the chronologically earliest occurrence of the\nterm ahl al- kitāb and that the word subsequently went on to attain formulaic dominance\nin the Medinan Qur’an.\nSchwally’s reworking of Nöldeke’s original treatment (GQ 1:155–156) adds complexity by\nincluding the conjecture that it might only be the exceptive clause “except for those of them\nwho are guilty of wrongdoing” (illā lladhīna ẓalamū minhum), which Schwally considers\nto be syntactically disruptive and whose only parallel occurs in the Medinan verse Q 2:150,\nthat is Medinan. This would pre- empt Nöldeke’s understanding that Q 29:46 authorises\nvio lence against wrongdoing scripturalists and would consequently remove one reason for\nexcising the entire verse as an insertion. On this hypothesis, the term ahl al- kitāb, which\noccurs slightly earlier in the verse, could still be Meccan. It remains the case, of course,\nthat all other occurrences of ahl al- kitāb are Medinan, but as Schwally points out, this is\nin the Qur’an, referring back to something mentioned before. As regards Q 29:47, he considers hāʾulāʾi to refer\n“to the people pre sent in the deictic space in an enlarged sense,” and he renders wa- min hāʾulāʾi man yuʾminu\nbihi as “t here are some among these people here who believe in it” (Birnstiel 2010, 172).\n15 It bears pointing out that the view that t hose who have inherited the scripture include wrongdoers is also\nasserted in Q 35:32, whose Meccan date Nöldeke and Schwally do not impugn (GQ 1:158); even in the Meccan\nperiod, the scripture- bearers are therefore not envisaged as a monolithic block.\n116 ahl al-k itāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As we saw above,\nQ 29:46 commands the recipients to address the scripturalists by professing belief in “what\nwas sent down to us and was sent down to youp” (alladhī unzila ilaynā wa- unzila ilaykum).\nThe verse thereby deploys a bipartite credal formula evoking belief in “what was sent down\nto youS/us” (mā unzila ilayka/ilaynā) and in “what was sent down before youS / before”\n(mā unzila min qablika/qablu) that is, like all other attestations of the phrase ahl al- kitāb,\nsolidly Medinan (Q 2:4, 4:60.162, 5:59). Of these parallels, Q 5:59 is particularly close to\n29:46, in so far as both are utterances in the first person plural and are directly addressed\nto the scripture- owners. Also relevant are Q 2:136 and 3:84, forming a virtual doublet\nwith each other in which the second component of the bipartite formula just highlighted\nis expanded into a cata logue of names: “We believe in God and what was sent down upon\n[3:84 has ʿalā here, 2:136 ilā] us and what was sent down upon Abraham, Ishmael, Isaac,\nJacob, and the descendants of Jacob (→ al- asbāṭ), and what was given to Moses and Jesus\nand ±​<what was given> to the prophets from their Lord. . . .” Like Q 5:59, 2:136 and 3:84\nare formulated in the first person plural. Q 3:199, moreover, lauds some of the scripturalists\nfor “believing in God and what was sent down to youp and what was sent down to them.”\nFi nally, there is a Medinan verse, Q 2:91, in which opponents (apparently, the Israelites)\nare quoted as believing only “in what was sent down upon us” and repudiate “what came\nafter it” (qālū nuʾminu bi- mā unzila ʿalaynā wa- yakfurūna bi- mā warāʾahu). By contrast,\nMeccan surahs, apart from Q 29:46, confine themselves to employing the first component\nof the bipartite formula, namely, “what was sent down to youS/youp” (Q 13:1.19.36, 34:6:\nalladhī/mā unzila ilayka, 7:3, 39:55: mā unzila ilaykum). On occasion, a similarly monopar-\ntite usage is found in Medinan texts as well (see the third-p erson variant mā unzila ilayhi /\nilā l- rasūli in Q 2:285, 5:81.83; see also mā unzila ilayka in 5:64.67.68, although vv. 66.68\nallude to “what was sent down” to the scripture- owners).\nThe cumulative evidence indicating that Q 29:46 is indeed a Medinan insertion is there-\nfore considerable, consisting both in key diction and in an appreciable tension between\nv. 46 and the following v. 47. Moreover, even though abrupt changes of grammatical ad-\ndressee are pervasive throughout the Qur’an, by way of an auxiliary consideration one\nmay point out that v. 46 is the only verse in the entire sequence vv. 44–52 that employs\nthe second person plural, being sandwiched in between verses addressing the Qur’anic\nMessenger in the second person singular (vv. 45 and 47–48). The presumptive reason for\nweaving v. 46 into the text would have been the Qur’anic community’s realisation, a fter the\nhijrah, that v. 47’s optimistic assertion that “t hose to whom we gave the scripture believe\nin it” did not prove to be the case in Medina.17 Verse 46 accordingly advises the Qur’anic\nbelievers on how to confront a group of scripturalists who were by no means generally\n16 Q 17:53 has, “Tell my servants to say that which is best,” yaqūlū llatī hiya aḥsanu; note that Q 16:125, like\n29:46, combines the phrase with the verb jādala.\n17 It is true, though, that other Meccan statements containing similarly optimistic statements about the\nscripture- bearers, such as Q 28:52–53, did not attract equivalent insertions.\nahl al-k itāb 117", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Standing apart from all of t hese occurrences is a poetic account of the\ncreation of the world by the Christian ʿAdī ibn Zayd, which describes the creation in terms\nof God “acquainting us with his first signs” (wa-ʿ arrafanā āyātihi l-uwalā; al-M uʿaybid 1965,\nno. 103:2; see Dmitriev 2010, 353 and 355–356). This usage, which may be presumed to\nbe influenced by the Biblical notion of a “sign” as a miraculous divine deed (see below),\nprovides a close pre ce dent for the Qur’an’s prevalent usage of the term āyah to denote\nmanifestations of God’s power and grace in the created world.\nGod’s signs in the Qur’an: overview. Unlike most of the poetic data just rehearsed,\nthe vast majority of occurrences of the term āyah in the Qur’an designate signs that are\nvouchsafed by God. Thus, the word is frequently part of the genitive construction āyāt\nallāh (e.g., Q 2:61.231.252, 3:4.6.19.21 etc., 30:10, 40:4.35.56 etc., 45:6; 19:58 has āyāt al-\nraḥmān) or accompanied by a possessive suffix referring to God (e.g., Q 2:39.41.73.129.151\netc., 78:28, 83:13, 90:19).3 God’s signs, which are often modified by the adjective bay-\nyin, “clear” (→ bayyana; e.g., Q 2:99.211, 3:97, 10:15, 17:101, 19:73, 28:36; see Rahman\n2009, 72–73), are “recounted” or “recited to” (tutlā or, in one case, tuliyat ʿalā) h umans\n(e.g., Q 3:101, 8:2.31, 10:15, 19:58, 68:15, 83:13; see Rahman 1980, 72, and Boisliveau 2014,\n74–75, as well as under → qaraʾa), or humans are “reminded” (→ dhakkara) of them\n(e.g., Q 18:57). Where the verb talā is used in the active, it is primarily divine messen-\ngers who appear as its grammatical subject (Q 28:59, 39:71), especially the Qur’anic one\n(Q 2:129.151, 3:164, 7:175, 62:2, 65:11), to whom the signs are in turn recounted or recited\n1 The Zuhayr verse is also quoted in al-F arāhī 2002, 136. The reference to Imruʾ al- Qays I owe to Dmitriev\n2010, 356, n. 42.\n2 The first three prooftexts are also cited in al- Farāhī 2002, 134–135. The poem by Mutammim ibn Nuwayrah\nis linked to the riddah wars that took place a fter Muhammad’s death, but Lyall and Jones both make a credible\ncase that it does not betray Islamic influence (see Lyall 1918–1924, 2:205–207; EAP 1:102–103).\n3 For a rare case in which the word does not refer to a divine sign but presumably to a waymark erected by\nhumans, see Q 26:128 (CDKA 32). At Q 17:12, the moon and the sun are called “the sign of the night” and “the\nsign of the day,” respectively (cf. Gen 1:14); although they are clearly also divine signs, these two formulations\nwould seem to intend primarily that the moon and the sun are indicators of night and day (see also Graham\n2014, 264–265).\nāyah 119", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This has the theo-\nlogically significant consequence that the intended addressees are not confined to those\nwho already possess knowledge or understanding.7 Similarly, the collocation of God’s\nsigns with the verb jādala in verses like Q 40:4.35.56.69 highlights the fact that Qur’anic\nāyāt are generally conceived as something discursive, something that can be adduced as a\ncompelling argument (Gwynne 2004, 26, and Abrahamov 2006, 3; see already FVQ 73).8\nTo reject these signs, then, is a failure of reason or rational comprehension, as marked\nby the verse- final concatenation of the noun āyah with the verb ʿaqala (“to understand”)\n4 Two verses that predicate the recounting or reciting of God’s signs of ordinary humans are Q 3:113 and\nprob ably also 22:72. At least in the former case, reference must be to scriptural recitation (see below). In Q 6:130\nand 7:35, God’s signs figure as the object of the verb qaṣṣa, “to narrate,” prob ably used approximately in the\nsame sense as talā.\n5 The collocation of bayyana + āyāt is exclusively Medinan.\n6 On the meanings that Arabic lexicographers assign to ṣarrafa, see AEL 1681 (the basic meaning given\nbeing the “turning of the winds . . . fr om one state or condition, to another; . . . o r from one direction, or course,\nor way, to another”).\n7 A con ve nient way of capturing this insight in translation without departing too much from the Arabic\nsyntax would be to render li- qawmin yaʿlamūn as “for people who would have knowledge.”\n8 Jefery contends that this argumentative connotation is also pre sent in Syriac ātā and cites TS 413 to\ncorroborate this, but the two Biblical passages adduced there are hardly sufficient support.\n120 āyah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, in Q 3:13 a\nbattle between believers and repudiators is described both as an āyah at the beginning of\nthe verse and as an ʿibrah at the end, thereby underscoring that an āyah is something that\nhas a “lesson”—s pecifically, a lesson to do with God—to impart, which in the case of Q 3:13\nis that “God aids with his help whom he w ills (man yashāʾu; → shāʾa).” A partial synonymity\nof the terms āyah and ʿibrah can also be inferred from observing how the phrase wa- inna\nlakum fī l- anʿāmi la- ʿibratan (“ There is a lesson for youp in livestock”) in Q 16:66 (see also\n23:21) is surrounded by similar phrases employing the word āyah (Q 16:65.67.69: inna fī\ndhālika la-ā yatan li- qawmin . . . , “In that t here is a sign for a p eople who . . .”).11 Elsewhere,\ntoo, the phrase inna fī dhālika la-ʿ ibratan (“ There is a lesson in that . . .”) occurs in relation\nto phenomena that are other wise categorised as “signs” (see Q 24:44, with regard to the\nalternation of day and night, and 79:26, with regard to God’s punishment of Pha raoh).\nIf Qur’anic signs are arguments, what is their precise content? As e arlier scholars have\nobserved, the Qur’an understands God’s signs to encompass natur al phenomena to do\nwith the creation and continued functioning of the cosmos in its pre sent state, on the one\nhand, and divine acts in history, on the other (e.g., KU 4; Watt 1970, 121–126; Rahman\n2009, 68–73; Graham 2014, 264–267). Both categories are designated with the word āyah\nfrom very early on in the Qur’an’s genesis, as demonstrated by the early Meccan Surah\n51. According to Q 51:20–21, “signs for those endowed with certainty” are found “in the\nearth” and “in yourselves,” both of which are prob ably an allusion to the theme of natu ral\nsigns (which include the gestation of the h uman embryo and fetus in the womb and vario us\nfeatures of the world that benefit humans). A l ater verse in the same surah, Q 51:37, then\napplies the term āyah to what is, in Biblical terms, God’s destruction of Sodom and Go-\nmorrah. The following discussion will begin by unpacking these two principal categories\nof Qur’anic signs, turning first to cosmic signs and then to historical ones. This is followed\nby a discussion of Qur’anic passages exhibiting a Biblically tinged use of the word āyah in\nrelation to confirmatory prophetic miracles. The entry’s final two sections explore two spe-\ncific senses of the term āyah that are secondary expansions of its basic meaning, namely, its\napplication to textual segments of the Qur’anic revelations and to divine commandments.\n9 According to Fazlur Rahman, the Qur’an “does not ‘prove’ God but ‘points to’ Him from the existing uni-\nverse”: God, he maintains, is discovered rather than inferred (Rahman 2009, 10 and 11; see also ibid., 3 and 70).\nYet the phenomena classed as “signs” in the Qur’an (see below) are quite plainly assumed to have considerable\nprobative weight, and the terminological fact that they are referred to as “signs” is not sufficient to refute that they\nare deemed to be cogent arguments that are in princi ple expected to sway even those who are not yet convinced\nof the Qur’an’s teachings. This is not, of course, to insist that Qur’anic arguments qualify as demonstrative proofs\nin a technical philosophical sense.\n10 The functional proximity of āyah and burhān is noted in Abrahamov 2006, 3, and Graham 2014, 270. On\nburhān and its etymology (from Ethiopic bәrhān, “light”), see NB 58–59, FVQ 77–78, Rahman 2009, 73–74, and\nCDKA 37–38. Ambros notes that at Q 4:174 (where burhān is paired with “clear light,” nūr mubīn) and 12:24 “the\nword may still be used in its original [Ethiopic] meaning . . . of ‘spiritual illumination.’ ”\nSee also Q 45:25, where the Qur’an’s opponents counter God’s “clear signs” with an “argument” (ḥujjah) of\ntheir own, albeit one deemed to be specious.\n11 On li- qawmin + verb in the prefix conjugation, see briefly above and under → faṣṣala.\nāyah 121", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic concept of signs, therefore, makes it pos si ble\nto articulate how a creator god who is unambiguously set apart from the world created by\nhim is nonetheless in some sense ubiquitously pre sent in it. In having recourse to semiotic\nterminology, the Qur’an would seem to recognise that there is some distinction to be\nmade between what indicates and what is being indicated— that is, between one’s experi-\nence of natu ral occurrences as such (vegetation, wind, rain), on the one hand, and one’s\nconstrual of t hese occurrences as divine acts, on the other. Moreover, Qur’anic appeals to\nexperience nature as a system of divine signs bespeak an obvious awareness that the natu-\nral occurrences in question are in fact being construed diferently by some humans, who\nfail to (or refuse to) detect in them the same, or perhaps any, religious surplus meaning.\nAt the same time, however, Qur’anic passages combining the noun āyah with the verb\nʿaqala (“to understand”) or passages condemning those who are heedless or in denial of\nGod’s signs make it very clear that to interpret worldly events in purely immanent terms,\nwithout reference to a transcendent creator and ruler, would by the Qur’an’s reckoning\nbe manifestly deficient, irrational, and invalid.12\n12 The preceding sentences are inspired by Taylor 2007, 11. Taylor contrasts the modern condition of sec-\nularity with a premodern condition in which there was no distinction between one’s experience of the world,\non the one hand, and its construal in terms of religious or super natural categories, on the other. By contrast, in\nthe modern situation of secularity “we cannot help but be aware that there are a number of dif er ent construals,\nviews which intelligent, reasonably undeluded p eople, of good w ill, can and do disagree on.” It seems to me\nthat the Qur’an occupies an intermediate position between these two poles: the Qur’anic concept of divine\nsigns amounts to an acknowledgement that t here is a certain distinction or gap between experience, on the\none hand, and its construal in theistic terms, on the other (an acknowledgement that likely reflects the high\ndegree of religious controversy in the Qur’anic environment); yet it would be difficult to maintain that the\nQur’an accepts alternative construals of the phenomena in question as defensible.

These claims involve, first, God’s om-\nnipotence, specifically his ability to bring to life what is seemingly dead, and, secondly,\nGod’s generous solicitude for h uman wellbeing, expressing itself in the fact that he has\nestablished, and continues to maintain, a world designed to meet human needs, a cos-\nmos in which God “has made what is in the heavens and what is on earth subservient to\nyoup” (Q 31:20, 45:13; cf. 22:65) and which is replete with “benefits” (manāfiʿ; → nafaʿa)\nfor humans (Q 16:5, 23:21, 36:73, 40:80, 57:25; Radscheit 1996a, 66; see in more detail\nunder → arḍ).13 In addition, some passages rehearsing natu ral signs exhibit a stress on\nnatu ral contrasts (Q 7:58, 30:37, 39:52) or reversals (Q 10:24, 36:33.37) that would appear\nto anticipate God’s diferential passing of judgement and the unexpected swiftness with\nwhich he may intervene in human afairs. The discretionary dimension of God’s power is\nhighlighted when one and the same natur al situation or phenomenon is depicted as leading\nto diametrically opposed outcomes: adjacent tracts of land that receive the same irrigation\nmay bear dif ere nt quantities of crops (Q 13:4; see also u nder → darajah); someone falling\nasleep may e ither wake up again or die in accordance with God’s decree (Q 39:42); ships\nmay be propelled across the ocean by the wind or experience a lull (Q 42:32–34); seafarers\nmay drown or be spared by God’s mercy (Q 36:43–44).\nThe Qur’an’s pervasive appeal to natur al phenomena as being pointers and indications\nthat are laden with theological purport has strong Christian pre ce dent (see generally De-\ncharneux 2021). For instance, according to the second- century Christian writer Theo philus\nof Antioch, God has “given you many indications (tekmēria) for believing him,” that is, for\nbelieving the doctrine of a f uture resurrection of the dead, and t hese indications are said\nto include “the resurrection (exanastasis) of seeds and fruits, occurring for the benefit (eis\ntēn chrēsin) of mankind” (Ad Autolycum 1:13 = Theo philus 1970, 16–17). This corresponds\ndirectly to the Qur’anic propensity to infer God’s power to raise the dead from his factually\nobvious revivification of dead earth (e.g., Q 41:39). At the terminological level, the Greek\nword tekmērion provides a compelling equivalent of Arabic āyah, while Theo philus’s invo-\ncation of benefit (chrēsis) recalls the Qur’anic employment of derivatives of the root n- f-ʿ .\nThe argument for the resurrection from the growth of crops is already found in Clement of\nRome’s Letter to the Corinthians (1 Clement 24 = Ehrmann 2003, 1:80–81; see Lehmann and\nPedersen 1914, 55), and it may be inspired by a passage in Paul explaining the resurrection\nof the dead with reference to the sowing of grain (1 Cor 15:35–49; cf. also John 12:24). The\nQur’an’s general recourse to natu ral phenomena as theological indicants, meanwhile, has\nbeen persuasively linked to Ephrem’s understanding that nature, like scripture, “testifies\ndistinguishing between a premodern awareness of God’s presence and power that is “experience- near” and a\nmodern approach according to which God’s presence and power have to be “discerned in the design of t hings.”\nFor a philosophical account of religion as experience (as opposed to a system of assumptions by which we explain\nand enframe our experiences), see Hick 1989, 129–171. Hick’s argument is grounded in the Kantian claim that all\nintentional experience is experiencing-a s: all experience fuses raw sensory awareness with concepts that enable\nus to classify, identify, and recognise what we are experiencing: for example, we perceive a bird by classifying a\ncertain sensory pattern of shape and movement, perhaps also of sound, as a bird. Against this background, Hick\nsuggests that religious concepts can be similarly woven into our experience of the world. Unlike Taylor, Hick is\nnot interested in sketching a historical transformation by which a premodern stance of experiencing the world\nin religious categories becomes, in the modern age, a set of religious hypotheses about the world.\n13 See also Rahman 2009, 78–79; Ambros 1990, 293, 309–310, 311; Peterson 2001, 473; HCI 172–174.\nāyah 123", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For instance,\nGod is the one said to spread out rain clouds “as he wills” (Q 30:48) and to direct them\nto the precise location where they will discharge their load (Q 7:57). God is therefore\ndirectly pre sent in the operations of the natu ral world, and Qur’anic “signs” reveal not\nonly God’s primordial role as the world’s creator but also “the overwhelming, efective\npresence of the transcendent God” (Frank 1992a, 23, n. 29) in the world as it presently\nexists. Consequently, Qur’anic āyāt, like the falling of rain and the resulting revivification\nof parched land, are not just indications of divine design and creation in the past but also\nquasi- miraculous deeds of God in the here and now. As we will see below, the Qur’an\napplies the word āyah not only to cosmic and historical indicants of God but also to pro-\nphetic miracles. The preceding remarks shed light on how this signification is linked to\nthe one presently under discussion: the Qur’an is seeking to instil in its recipients a vivid\nsense that God is miraculously at work in even the most everyday occurrences, such as\nthe facts that birds do not drop from the sky (Q 16:79) or that the sky does not collapse\nupon the earth (Q 22:65).\nHistorical signs. By contrast with cosmic signs, historical ones have a more consistently\nsinister thrust and often centre on God’s punitive obliteration of previous communities,\naccounts of which are customarily termed “punishment legends” (KU 10–32; Marshall\n1999, 27–115; HCI 169–172). Thus, the word āyah appears in connection with the deluge\nthat engulfed the contemporaries of Noah (Q 23:30, 25:37, 26:121, 29:15, 36:41, 54:15), the\nannihilation of the sinful compatriots of Lot (Q 15:75.77, 26:174, 29:35, 51:37), the drowning\nof Phar aoh and the Egyptians during their pursuit of the Israelites (Q 10:92, 26:67; see Sinai\n2019a, 239–240), and the destruction of several non- Biblical peoples (Q 26:139.158.190,\n27:52, 34:15.19). Undoubtedly, the semiotic character of such past punishments resides\nto a significant degree in the fact that they prefigure God’s eschatological punishment in\nthe future. This would seem to be the reason why accounts of past divine punishments\nare in a number of cases followed by affirmations to the efect that “in this” (fī dhālika)\nthere is a sign “for t hose who fear the punishment of the hereafter” (Q 11:103) and the like\n14 This theme is also found in Jacob of Sarug; see Mathews 2020, 3 and 16–20. On Jewish and Christian\nparallels to the Qur’an’s theologically charged portrayal of the natu ral world, see also BEQ 6–8.\n15 Lehmann and Pedersen more cautiously allow for the possibility that the primary background of the\nQur’anic argument for the resurrection from the creation of embryos was Jewish rather than Christian (Leh-\nmann and Pedersen 1914, 60). However, it seems to me that the quantity of Christian parallels they pre sent as\nwell as the explic itly argumentative character of these parallels justifies plumping for the Christian alternative.\n124 āyah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The connection that exists, from the Qur’anic perspective, between\ncosmic signs and traces of past divine devestations is particularly clear from Q 40:79–85,\ncombining a reminder of some common natu ral signs (vv. 79–80) with a general reference\nto the destruction of earlier peoples (vv. 82–85), after an explicit exhortation that God\n“shows youp his signs” in the preceding verse (v. 81). This bracketing together of past\nacts of divine retribution with features of the natu ral order as it functions in the pre sent\nmay involve a certain affinity with the usage of the word āyah in poetic evocations of\ndeserted campsites. Some Qur’anic passages imply that God’s retaliatory eradication\nof past communities is attested by material remains in the pre sent (see Q 14:45, 20:128,\n22:45–46, 27:52, 28:58, 29:38, 32:26, 37:137–138, perhaps also 46:25.27), similar to the\ntraces of deserted tribal abodes that figure in poetry. Hence, in cases in which God’s past\nactions consisted in a devastation of entire settlements, the consequences of t hese divine\ninterventions are presumed to be at least sometimes available for empirical inspection\nin the here and now, as evidenced by the Qur’an’s appeals to its audience “to travel the\nearth” (verb: → sāra fī l- arḍi) and “behold” (verb: naẓara) the “end” (ʿāqibah) of previous\nsinners and evildoers (Q 3:137, 6:11, 12:109, 16:36, 27:69, 30:9.42, 35:44, 40:21.82, 47:10).17\nThe Qur’an thus bespeaks a profound awareness of inhabiting a landscape dotted with\nruins that have a theological lesson to impart, just as the cosmic order, too, has theological\nlessons to impart.\nTwo final passages that deserve brief mention before concluding the pre sent discussion\nof historical signs are the Meccan verses Q 7:73 and 11:64. Both describe the “she- camel of\nGod” that the people of Thamūd were prohibited from harming (a command they failed\nto heed) as a sign for Thamūd (lakum āyatan)— rather than, as might have been expected,\ncasting the subsequent destruction of Thamūd as a sign for the Qur’an’s own audience.\nThe operative meaning of a divine sign would here seem to be an empirically verifiable\nfact to which humans are bidden to respond in the right manner, on pain of catastrophic\npunishment. The she- camel is evidently not a historical sign for Thamūd nor does it form\na general aspect of the operation of the cosmos—or, for that m atter, amount to a clearly\nmiraculous occurrence like those worked by Moses (see below). Similar to Q 40:79–85,\n7:73 and 11:64 accordingly illustrate the limitations of an overly rigorous attempt to discern\na limited number of neatly demarcated subcategories of signs in the Qur’an.\nSigns as confirmatory miracles. We saw above the pos si ble relevance of the poetic\nusage of the term āyah to the its semantics in the Qur’an. However, when the word āyah is\nused in the context of prophetic history its Qur’anic employment goes back to the Biblical\nconcept of a sign (Hebrew: ôt, Peshitta: ātā, Greek: sēmeion), which can mean a miraculous\nattestation of God’s presence and a vindication of the truthfulness of a human claimant\nto prophecy (FVQ 73; see also HALOT 26 and TDOT 1:167–188; TDNT 7:200–261 also\n16 As noted in KK 243–244, the formula inna fī dhālika la- āyatan/āyāt li- . . . i s also frequent with re spect\nto natu ral signs and in other contexts.\n17 Calls to behold the end of previous sinners, without reference to travel, are even more frequent.\nāyah 125", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This notion of divinely produced sign- events is perhaps\nmost notable in the Pentateuchal account of Moses and the Exodus (Exod 4:8–9.17.28.30,\n7:3, and 10:1–2), but it is also very much in evidence in the New Testament (see, e.g., John\n2:11, 4:54, 6:2.14, Acts 2:22, and 2 Cor 12:12). In the Qur’an, too, references to “signs” are\nparticularly prominent in connection with Moses, who together with his b rother Aaron is\nreported to have been sent to Phar aoh “with our/my signs,” bi-ā yātinā/bi-ā yātī (Q 7:103,\n10:75, 11:96, 14:5, 20:42, 23:45, 26:15, 28:35–36, 40:23, 43:46–47). Moses’s signs, which are\nquantified as nine (Q 17:101, 27:12), include two confirmatory miracles with which he is\nequipped during his prophetic commission (Q 7:106–108, 20:17–23, 27:12), also labelled\n“signs” in Exod 4:8–9, in addition to the Egyptian plagues (Q 7:130–135; see KK 307–308).\nThe declaration that Moses was sent “with” God’s signs may additionally be informed by\nthe fact that the Qur’an depicts Moses, like Noah (Q 10:71 and 71:10–20), as invoking some\nof the Qur’an’s standard cosmic signs for God’s power and benevolence (Q 20:50.53–55,\nsignificantly followed in v. 56 by the statement that Pha raoh was shown all of God’s signs).\nMoses thus emerges as comprehensively equipped both with discursive and miraculous\nsigns. An explicit reflection of this comprehensive empowerment of Moses may be detected\nin verses expanding the assertion that he was sent “with” God’s signs by a reference to the\n“clear authority” (→ sulṭān mubīn) invested in him (Q 11:96, 23:45, 40:23; see also 28:35).\nIn addition to Moses, Jesus too is credited with producing miraculous sign- events (Q 3:49;\ncf. 5:110, though without the term āyah). Moreover, the miraculous sending- down of a laid\ntable upon the disciples of Jesus is also termed a “sign” (Q 5:114).\nIt is noteworthy that a Biblically tinged understanding of divine āyāt as confirma-\ntory miracles also informs statements ascribed to the Qur’an’s opponents (see also\nunder → ashraka), who are portrayed as challenging Muhammad to vindicate his claim\nto be a divine messenger by a miracle (Q 2:118, 6:37, 7:203, 10:20, 13:7.27, 20:133, 21:5,\n29:50), “like previous messengers” (Q 21:5; see also 6:124 and 28:48)— a request similar\nto those allegedly put to Jesus (see especially Matt 12:38 and 16:1, Mark 8:11, Luke 11:16).18\nIn implicit debate with such polemical demands, the Meccan proclamations maintain that\nample signs are in fact available “in the heavens and on earth” (Q 10:101), but understands\nthese to be not spectacular one- of occurrences but rather commonly accessible natu ral\nphenomena, like the falling of rain or the alternation of night and day, that support the\ncontent of Muhammad’s preaching.19 To be sure, two passages attribute to the Qur’anic\nmessenger visions of God’s “signs” (Q 17:1 and 53:18), but neither strictly speaking conforms\nto the public miracle- working demanded by his adversaries. Instead, at least the Meccan\nsurahs insist that Muhammad’s claim to being a divinely sent “warner” (mundhir, nadhīr;\ne.g., Q 13:7, 29:50; see u nder → bashshara) is sufficiently validated by the cogency of his\nrecounting of God’s signs in nature and history. The audience’s expectation of a miraculous\nsign- event akin to the confirmatory miracles granted to Moses (Q 28:48) is thus deflected.\nThis is not to say, however, that the Qur’an disavows the general possibility that God\nmight “send down a sign from heaven” to Muhammad’s contemporaries (Q 26:4 and\nsimilarly 6:37; note that the formulation “a sign from heaven” is also found in Matt 16:1,\n18 This demand is mirrored by the audience of the messenger Ṣāliḥ (Q 26:154). See also, regarding Moses,\nQ 7:106 and 26:31 (KK 370).\n19 See Abrahamov 2006, 4: “Muhammad’s prophecy is not proved directly by āyāt; rather it is proved\nthrough legitimating his message by āyāt. When the message is demonstrated to be genuine, the messenger is a\ntrue prophet.” Cf. also Rahman 2009, 77–78.\n126 āyah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This explicit reservation accords with the fact that even be-\nyond the career of Moses, God’s signs in history include miraculous acts responding to\nhuman petitions, such as the sending down of a t able to Jesus and the Apostles (Q 5:114)\nor the temporary muteness of Zechariah after receiving the promise that he will have a son\n(Q 3:41, 19:10). In a similar vein, Q 2:248 describes the Israelite ark (al- tābūt) as a sign of\nSaul’s kingship, in so far as it confirms the prior claim by an anonymous Israelite prophet\n(Samuel, in Biblical terms) that “God has appointed Saul as yourp king” (Q 2:247). Other\nhistorical persons and events that are described as divine signs, presumably in so far as\nthey exemplify God’s workings and unbridled liberty to intervene in the world that he has\ncreated, are Joseph and his b rothers (Q 12:7), the “Companions of the Cave” (Q 18:9.17),\nJesus and Mary (Q 19:21, 21:91, 23:50), and God’s deliverance of Abraham from being burnt\nby his compatriots (Q 29:24). Q 2:67–73 recounts, and labels as one of God’s “signs” (v. 73),\nthe story of how Moses instructed the ancient Israelites to revivify a murder victim with\npart of a slaughtered yellow cow (cf. Deut 21:1–9 and Num 19:2; see BEQ 345–346). H ere,\ntoo, a sign is a doctrinally laden divine deed in the past, whose theological purport is duly\nexplicated in a concluding comment: “Thus does God bring the dead to life and show you\nhis signs, so that you may comprehend” (Q 2:73). The same understanding underlies the\nstory of an anonymous traveller whom God resurrected a hundred years after his demise,\nalso called a sign (Q 2:259).20 Perhaps building on the notion of a divine sign as a critical\ndivine intervention on behalf of the right eous that can be discerned in Q 29:24 (God’s\nrescue of Abraham), Medinan verses frame not only the Israelites’ God- given victory over\nGoliath (Q 2:252) as a divine sign but also God’s assistance of the Qur’anic believers in\nbattles with their Meccan foes (Q 3:13, 48:20).\nThe plural āyāt as a designation for textual segments of revelation. In the later Mec-\ncan and the Medinan surahs, the Qur’anic notion of signs acquires additional layers. First,\nand most importantly, the term āyāt begins to be employed to refer to textual units or\nsegments of revelation, thus foreshadowing its post- Qur’anic meaning “verses” (see, e.g.,\nCDKA 32; Abrahamov 2006, 6–7; Graham 2014, 267–269; Boisliveau 2014, 75–76). In so far\nas a substantial part of the Qur’anic proclamations is dedicated to recounting God’s signs\nin nature and history, it is understandable how the term “sign” could secondarily come to\ndesignate portions of these proclamations themselves. For instance, when Q 38:29 states\nthat God has sent down the celestial scripture to the Qur’anic messenger (→ kitāb) so that\nhis hearers “may contemplate its āyāt,” this can be taken to refer both to the “signs” that are\nrecounted in the scripture and also to the “sign-p ronouncements” (see also under → dhā-\nlika) that constitute it (similarly Q 41:44).21 The semantic shift t owards a textual meaning of\nthe word āyah is already vis i ble in surah introductions like Q 10:1, 11:1, 12:1, 13:1 e tc., evok-\ning the “sign-p ronouncements” of the celestial scripture, and becomes undeniable in the\nMeccan verse Q 16:101, commenting on God’s “altering” or “exchanging” (verb: baddala)\nof one revelatory sign-p ronouncement for another, as well as in the Medinan verses Q 2:106\n(God may abrogate, nasakha, some sign- pronouncements or cause them to be forgotten),\n3:7 (some of the scripture’s constituent sign-p ronouncements are unambiguous, o thers\n20 Note that here (and in the Abraham episode narrated in the following verse, Q 2:260), God responds to\na prior human profession of doubt or at least a demand for a sign, as in Q 3:41, 5:114, and 19:10.\n21 Regarding the proposal that āyah in its textual meaning be rendered “sign- pronouncement,” see already\nthe remarks in Grimme 1895, 74, rendering āyāt als Einzelmitteilungen.\nāyah 127", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

A second semantic development of\nthe term āyah in the Medinan period consists in the fact that some passages apply the word\nto legal ordinances or at least broadly normative instructions, which are sometimes fol-\nlowed by clausulae invoking God’s “making clear of his signs” or the like (Abrahamov 2006,\n7, and Goudarzi 2018, 284; see, e.g., Q 2:187.219.221, 5:89, 9:11, 24:58.59.61). As Goudarzi\ncomments, this usage would seem to be rooted in the connotation that a divine “sign” is\n“something that is instrumental to h uman guidance, w hether it be a fact of nature, a histor-\nical narrative, or a legal injunction.” Perhaps this Medinan usage also builds on Q 7:73 and\n11:64 in par tic u lar (see above), where the camel sent by God is labelled a sign for Thamūd\n(lakum āyatan), coming as it does with the clear instruction to let it graze freely and not\nto harm it (fa- dharūhā taʾkul fī arḍi llāhi wa- lā tamassūhā bi- sūʾin) and with a concomitant\nthreat of punishment in case of non- compliance (fa- yaʾkhudhakum ʿadhābun qarīb).\nayyada tr.

Its component expressions are discussed elsewhere (→ ism, → allāh, → al- raḥmān).\nStructurally, the basmalah’s tripartite shape recalls the Christian invocation “In the name of\nthe F ather and the Son and the Holy Ghost” that originates in Jesus’s baptismal command\nin Matt 28:19 (Neuwirth 2010, 241; HCI 143). The basmalah, of course, does not enumerate\nthree distinct divine persons but rather identifies God and “the Merciful” as constituting one\nand the same divine being. The basmalah formula may thus be considered an assertion of\nthe Qur’an’s rigorous mono thei sm. At the same time, the basmalah ties together two divine\nnames of ultimately in de pen dent origin, → allāh and → al- raḥmān, which are discussed in\nseparate entries. The following entry pays par tic u lar attention to the link between the\nbasmalah and South Arabian epigraphy and to the chronological question of w hether the bas-\nmalah predates or postdates Q 27:30, the basmalah’s only occurrence inside a Qur’anic surah.\nThe date of the basmalah, Q 27:30, and South Arabian inscriptions. The divine name\n“the Merciful” (al- raḥmān) does not occur in the earliest Qur’anic proclamations. Since the\nbasmalah includes the expression al- raḥmān, it is likely that its prefatory use at the begin-\nning of e very surah except for Surah 9 is a secondary innovation that postdates the emer-\ngence of al- raḥmān as a divine name around the middle of the Meccan period (Nöldeke\n1860, 88). The two earliest occurrences of al- raḥmān outside the basmalah are Q 55:1 and\n26:5, with a mean verse length of 32.97 and 36.71 transliteration letters, respectively; some-\nwhat l ater, a cluster of surahs whose mean verse length is located in the relatively narrow\nrange from 55 to 75 transliteration letters makes strikingly frequent use of the divine name\n“the Merciful” (see under → al- raḥmān). It is tempting to guess that the emergence of the\nbasmalah formula falls somewhere around the same time as the surahs just referenced;\nbut this consideration is hardly sufficient to rule out that the basmalah may only have\nsurfaced at a later moment in time.

Schwally\ndraws attention to Q 27:30, where the basmalah is cited as the opening of a letter that the\nqueen of Sabaʾ (see Q 27:22–23) receives from Solomon (GQ 1:117). The verse could be\nconstrued as providing a terminus ante quem for the basmalah by virtue of appearing to\nevidence a moment in the Qur’an’s genesis at which a prefatory use of the basmalah in\ndocuments of broadly religious significance had come to be assumed as a formulaic given\n(Neuwirth 2010, 241; PP 268; Neuwirth 2016c, 40). Since Surah 27 has a mean verse length\nof 78.19 transliteration letters, an understanding of Q 27:30 as the terminus ante quem of\nthe basmalah would neatly confirm a middle Meccan dating of the formula.\nYet it is conceivable that what Q 27:30 reflects is not the prior emergence of the basmalah\nin Qur’anic usage but merely the invocatory conventions of South Arabian epigraphy (see\nalso Ghafar 2020, 102–110). For example, the opening and closing invocations in a Christian\ninscription from the realm of Ḥimyar, datable to the 530s CE, contain the phrase “In the\nname of the Merciful” (b- s1m rḥmnn; see Robin 2015a, 163–164; Robin and Rijziger 2018,\n281). The same phrase recurs at the end of another Christian inscription (Ryckmans 1946,\n167 and 172: “In the name of the Merciful and his son Christ, the Victorious”) and in the\nnotice commemorating what appears to have been the final maintenance of the dam of\nMārib in 558 CE during the reign of Abraha (Robin 2015a, 170–171).1 This Christian use of “In\nthe name of the Merciful” constitutes a functional and structural variant of a more general\nformulaic convention in epigraphic Sabaic: other inscriptions, both from before and a fter\nḤimyar’s abolition of traditional South Arabian polytheism, employ closing formulae that\ncommence with the preposition b- followed by the name of a deity or a ruler, often with\nintervening terms like “power” (ḫyl), “assistance” (rdʾ), or “authority” (mqm; Robin and\nRijziger 2018, 286–287; Stein 2013, 93–95). An invocatory employment of the preposition\nb- is also attested for Qatabanian, another dialect of Epigraphic South Arabian (Ricks 1989,\n19). It is true that third- and fourth- century Sasanian inscriptions include a phrase similar\nto the basmalah, “In the name of the gods” (pad nām ī yazdān; Gignoux 1990). Yet it is not\ncertain that the Iran ian evidence may count as a direct antecedent of the Qur’anic basmalah\n(Shaked 1992, 152). Minimally, it may be submitted that the South Arabian material just\nsurveyed provides precursors that are both sufficient and geo graphi c ally more proximate,\nleaving no immediate explanatory role for Sasanian epigraphy.\nThe Jabal Dhabūb inscription and the identity of Allāh/God and al-r aḥmān (“the\nMerciful”). A particularly captivating potential antecedent of the basmalah is found in a\npossibly pre- Qur’anic inscription from Jabal Dhabūb in a late form of the South Arabian\ncursive script. Its first line, as read by its original editors (b-s 1mlh rḥmn rḥmn rb s1mwt),\nmay contain the full basmalah— namely, if one reads the second word as raḥmān without\nthe suffixed Epigraphic South Arabian article - ān and the third one as raḥīmān, with the\n- ān suffix (al- Ḥājj and Faqʿas 2018, 19 and 21–22). However, Ahmad Al- Jallad has more\nconvincingly argued for a revised interpretation according to which the introduction\nencompasses only two components, b-s 1mlh rḥmn, “In the name of God, the Merciful\n(raḥmān),” followed by the plea “have mercy upon us (rḥmn = irḥamnā), O Lord of the\nheavens (rb s1mwt)” (Al- Jallad, forthcoming). The upshot of this re- reading is that the\n1 Th ese instances of “In the name of the Merciful” are not the only Sabaic inscriptions from the sixth c entury\nthat combine an invocatory b- with the divine name “the Merciful” (rḥmnn, presumably pronounced raḥmānān).\nThus, one of the inscriptions of Abraha begins, “With the power of the Merciful and of his Messiah” (Robin 2015a,\n153, 164, 169; Robin and Rijziger 2018, 281).\nbi-s mi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm 131", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Nonetheless, and despite its chronological uncertainty,\nthe Jabal Dhabūb inscription is the only evidence currently available to the efect that a\ncombination of the basmalah’s first two ele ments, “In the name of Allāh/God” and “the\nMerciful,” might predate the Qur’an. The closest parallels to the basmalah in the South\nArabian epigraphic rec ord are other wise confined to the phrase “In the name of the\nMerciful,” without a preceding mention of Allāh.3\nAs argued below and in a separate entry (→ al- raḥmān), the basmalah’s final adjective\nal- raḥīm, which according to Al- Jallad’s interpretation is absent from the Jabal Dhabūb\ninscription, is explicable as facilitating the common Qur’anic rhyme ī/ū + m/n. The third\nelem ent of the basmalah, consisting in the definite adjective al- raḥīm, is therefore reasonably\ntaken to be a Qur’anic supplement (thus also Al- Jallad, forthcoming). As regards the fact that\nthe Qur’anic basmalah, like the Jabal Dhabūb inscription, includes an opening reference to\nAllāh, in contrast with the Christian epigraphic formula “In the name of the Merciful,” this\nis best explained as serving to codify the identity of the North Arabian deity Allāh with the\nmono thei stic Ḥimyarite deity “the Raḥmān” (Al- Jallad, forthcoming). If the Jabal Dhabūb\ninscription is indeed pre- Qur’anic, this equivalence must predate Muhammad. One rea-\nson why such a scenario is attractive is the fact that t here is some purportedly pre-I slamic\npoetry in which al- raḥmān and Allāh would already seem to be employed interchangeably\n(or which is at least consistent with this supposition): the two divine names occur in con-\nsecutive verses of a poem from the corpus of al-A ʿshā Maymūn (Ḥusayn 1983, no. 15:36–37;\nsee Sinai 2019b, 20 and 59); a Hudhalī poet refers to al- raḥmān as the provider of rain, a\nrole that pre-I slamic poets other wise attribute to Allāh (Farrāj and Shākir 1963–1965, 742,\nal-B urayq, no. 1:6; Sinai 2019b, 29); and Salāmah ibn Jandal describes the inscrutable and\nsovereign impact that “the Merciful” has on h uman fates in terms that very much resemble\nwhat other poets say about Allāh (Qabāwah 1987, 182–184, no. 3:36–38; Sinai 2019b, 34).\nThus, the fusion of Allāh and al- raḥmān that is documented in and presupposed by the\nQur’an appears to have begun to surface well before Muhammad, which adds plausibility\nto a pre- Qur’anic dating of the Jabal Dhabūb inscription.4\nQ 27:30 as the original Qur’anic occurrence of the basmalah. That the basmalah harks\nback to South Arabian epigraphic conventions, as proposed above, is substantiated by a\ncloser examination of its only occurrence within a Qur’anic surah, in Q 27:30. A fter all, the\n2 Al-Ḥ ājj and Faqʿas envisage the possibility that this undated inscription dates from the early Islamic period\n(al- Ḥājj and Faqʿas 2018, 26–31).\n3 As Ahmad al- Jallad has pointed out to me in a personal correspondence, the opening invocation bi- smi-ka\nllāhumma / rabbanā appears in a number of hitherto unpublished Arabic inscriptions from the Ḥijāz dating to\nthe sixth c entury CE. See https:// twitter. com/ mohammed93athar/ status/ 1342890836531544068? s=​ 2​0 (accessed\n8 March 2021) and also Al- Jallad and Sidky 2021, 9.\n4 It is true that Q 17:110 (“Say, ‘Call upon Allāh/God or call upon the Merciful; whichever you call upon, to\nhim belong the most excellent names’ ”) could indicate that the referential equivalence of allāh and al- raḥmān\nwas not self- evident. However, on a more likely reading of the verse, it merely addresses the question which of\nthe two principal Qur’anic divine names should be deemed to take prec e dence over the other in prayer (→ ism).\nJomier maintains that there was re sis tance to the divine name al- raḥmān in the Ḥijāz and that this divine name\nwas new to the Meccans (Jomier 1957, 365–370). However, apart from Q 17:110 and other ambiguous Qur’anic\nverses (Q 13:30, 21:36, 25:60; see QP 66–68), Jomier argues mainly on the basis of post- Qur’anic traditions,\nwhose depiction of Meccan paganism can hardly be accepted as objective fact. As duly underscored by Crone,\na serious difficulty with Jomier’s position is that the Qur’an sometimes pre sents its pagan opponents themselves\nas speaking of “the Merciful” as their god (QP 67; the most straightforward case is Q 21:26).\n132 bi-s mi llāhi l-r aḥmāni l- raḥīm", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Solomon’s missive shares with the Epigraphic South Arabian material re-\nviewed e arlier the quality of constituting a written expression of royal authority, and indeed\nboth aspects—w riting and authority—w ould appear to be explic itly reflected in Q 27:29,\nwhere the queen of Sabaʾ says that she has received “a noble writing” (kitāb karīm). Quite\npossibly, then, the specific wording of the basmalah was first coined in Q 27:30, modelled\non Sabaic epigraphic conventions. That the basmalah was subsequently excerpted from this\nverse, rather than being presupposed by it, is further supported by the observation that the\nbasmalah formula is well integrated into the literary context of Q 27:30, since the expansion\nof the divine name al- raḥmān by the cognate adjective al- raḥīm ensures conformity with\nSurah 27’s rhyme in ī/ū + m/n. This is in fact true for all other cases apart from the basmalah\nin which the Qur’an concatenates al- raḥmān with the cognate adjective al- raḥīm (Q 1:3,\n2:163, 41:2, and 59:22; → al- raḥmān). This indicates that the primary function of expand-\ning bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmān by appending al- raḥīm, apart from adding emphasis (“the truly\nMerciful”), is to facilitate rhyme.\nThere is, in sum, much to recommend the hypothesis that the prefixing of the basmalah\nto Qur’anic surahs postdates, rather than antedates, Q 27:30. It is not inconceivable that\nthis prefatory use of the basmalah at the beginning of almost all Qur’anic surahs could be\npost- prophetic. In favour of this, one might note the striking popularity and subsequent\ndesuetude of the divine name → al-r aḥmān in the Qur’an. As explained in the relevant\nentry, al- raḥmān is conspicuously frequent in a certain group of l ater Meccan texts that are\naptly called the “raḥmān surahs,” but subsequently dis appears almost completely inside\nsurahs. Thus, al- raḥmān is only twice found within Medinan texts (Q 2:163, 59:22, both of\nwhich contain the frequent Qur’anic profession of mono the ism lā ilāha illā huwa, “ There\nis no god but him,” as well as the verse-fi nal predication huwa l- raḥmānu l- raḥīm, “He is\nthe truly Merciful”). This almost complete absence, throughout the entire Medinan period,\nof the erstwhile extremely popu lar divine name al- raḥmān is perhaps not what one would\nhave expected had the use of the basmalah become routine at a time when new Qur’anic\ncompositions were still coming into being. Rather, one might have i magined that regular\nuse of the basmalah would have acted to stabilise al- raḥmān as a divine name or epithet\nin chronologically later layers of the Qur’an.\nOn the other hand, surah-i nitial basmalahs are attested in early manuscripts such as\nBirmingham University Library Mingana Islamic Arabic 1572a (containing the beginning of\nSurah 20) and the lower layer of the Sanaa Palimpsest (Sadeghi and Goudarzi 2012, 52–53,\n63, 72, 83). Assuming that presently available radiocarbon datings of t hese manuscripts are\naccurate, this requires the basmalah to have come to be incorporated into the Qur’anic text\nwithin approximately a de cade after Muhammad’s death at the latest. A likely scenario is\nperhaps that a prefatory use of the basmalah emerged when a written compilation of the\ncorpus of Muhammad’s revelations was first produced. According to the Islamic tradition,\nwhat was l ater on to become the standard recension of the Qur’an was created within two\nyears a fter the Prophet’s death, during the caliphate of Abū Bakr (Motzki 2001), and it may\nbe that this was indeed the time when the prefatory basmalah asserted itself as the scribal\nadaptation of an originally epigraphic formulaic convention, inspired by the formula’s\noriginal Qur’anic appearance in Surah 27 and perhaps reinforced by the occasional verse-\nfinal collocation of al- raḥmān and al- raḥīm in Q 1:3, 2:163, 41:2, and 59:22.\nbi-s mi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm 133", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Unlike the phrase bi- smi rabbika (→ ism),\nwhich figures as the prepositional complement of the verbs sabbaḥa, “to praise” (e.g.,\nQ 56:74.96; see under → ḥamd), and → qaraʾa, normally “to recite” (Q 96:1), the basmalah\nhas the status of an isolated prepositional syntagm lacking a governing verb. Muslim ex-\negetes subintellect contextually appropriate verbal clauses such as “I recite” or “I com-\nmence reciting” (e.g., Ṭab. 1:112–116). A dif er ent solution is intimated by al- Qurṭubī, who\nreports that “the scholars” construe the formula as a divine oath (qasamun min rabbinā;\nal- Qurṭubī 2006, 1:142). However, this understanding (which is espoused in Samji 2018,\n52; see also Graham 2001, 208) does not conform to the phraseological characteristics of\nQur’anic oaths as attested elsewhere in the corpus. Oaths in the Qur’an take two forms:\nthey either consist in an explicit uqsimu bi-, “I swear by . . .” (e.g., Q 56:75 or 69:38) or, more\nfrequently, simply employ wāw al- qasam (i.e., the oath- introducing use of wa-) followed\nby a noun in the genitive, as in Q 91:1–7.5 Leaving aside the disputed case of the basmalah,\nthere are thus no instances in which a Qur’anic oath lacks the explicit uqsimu, “I swear,”\nyet includes the preposition bi- that normally follows this verb. There is consequently no\ninner- Qur’anic support for understanding the basmalah as an oath. This makes it all the\nmore apt to accept the argument put forward above that the basmalah’s verb- less bi- is to\nbe linked with the invocatory b- that occurs in Epigraphic South Arabian, where it opens\nsimilarly “asyntactic” invocations (Stein 2013, 93–94) like “In the name of the Merciful”\n(b- s1m rḥmnn).\nbashshara tr.

Both Meccan and Me-\ndinan verses define the function of Muhammad or the Qur’anic revelations as being that\nof a “warner” (nadhīr)1 and a “bringer of good tidings” (bashīr, mubashshir; see Q 2:119,\n5:19, 7:188, 11:2, 17:105, 25:56, 33:45, 34:28, 35:24, 41:4, 48:8). Other verses combine the\ncorresponding verbs andhara, “to warn,” and bashshara, “to give glad tidings” (Q 10:2,\n18:2, 19:97, 36:11; see also 46:12). Earlier messengers, too, are said to have conveyed a\ndual message of warning and glad tidings: “We only send the messengers as bearers of\ngood tidings (mubashshirīn) and as warners (mundhirīn)” (Q 6:48, 18:56; see also 2:213\nand 4:165). That the Qur’anic Messenger, like his pre de ces sor Noah, is only a “warner” or\n“a clear warner” (nadhīr mubīn) is also stressed (e.g., Q 7:184, 11:12.25, 13:7, 22:49, 26:115,\n29:50, 35:23, 38:65.70, 46:9, 51:50–51, 67:26, 71:2, 79:45).

Conversely, the messengers’ glad tidings consist in the promise\nof divine forgiveness and eschatological “wage” or reward (→ ajr; Q 18:2, 36:11) and the\npossibility of deliverance in paradise (Q 42:23).\nAccording to Q 4:165, God’s rationale for sending messengers to convey warnings and\nglad tidings is “so that the people would not have an argument against God after [the\nsending of] the messengers” (li- allā yakūna li- l- nāsi ʿalā llāhi ḥujjatun baʿda l- rusuli). The\nidea is clearly that h umans would have ground to complain against God w ere they to be\nheld eschatologically responsible for their earthly actions without having been previously\napprised of this in clear terms. This is not far from the Muʿtazilite claim that the sending\nof revelations (al- taklīf al- samʿī, “imposing obligations through revelation”) is, as Richard\nFrank has put it, “morally necessary on God’s part” (Frank 1971, 15).\nNon- eschatological and sarcastic uses of b-s h-r . Bashshara or the corresponding\nnoun bushrā, “glad tidings,” can also be used for joyous announcements that are non-\neschatological, especially of the f uture birth of a child (Q 3:39.45, 11:69.71.74, 15:53–55,\n16:58–59, 19:7, 29:31, 37:101.112, 43:17, 51:28). In Q 61:6, Jesus gives the Israelites the\nglad tidings “of a messenger coming a fter me whose name is most praiseworthy (ismuhu\naḥmad)” (Q 61:6; cf. Anthony 2016, 273–277), an allusion to Muhammad that puns on the\nidentical root consonants of aḥmad and the name muḥammad. In a number of passages,\nderivatives of b- sh- r are applied to a natu ral phenomenon, namely, wind indicating im-\npending rainfall: God sends the winds “as bearers of glad tidings (mubashshirāt) and so\nthat they might give youp a taste of his mercy” (Q 30:46; see also 7:57, 25:48, 27:63). The\nimplicit parallel with God’s sending of messengers as b earers of glad eschatological tidings\nties in with a tendency discernible in other Qur’anic passages to posit an analogy between\nthe ways in which God acts in the natur al world and the ways in which he acts in history\nand at the end of it. Perhaps the clearest example is the Qur’anic inference leading from\nGod’s revivification of land that is “dead” to his ability to revive and judge deceased h umans\n(see Q 30:19.50, 35:9, 41:39, 50:11, and also under → āyah).\nOn occasion, the verb bashshara is used ironically or sarcastically (Stewart 2015, 196–\n198). One example is found in Q 9:3: “Give the repudiators the glad tidings of a painful\npunishment!” (similarly in Q 3:21, 4:138, 9:34, 31:7, 45:8, and 84:24; see also 16:59). Based\non t hese references, classical Arabic lexicographers suggest that bashshara can sometimes\nmean simply “to convey tidings” rather than “to convey glad tidings,” a position accepted\nby Arne Ambros (CDKA 39). However, as pointed out by Ambros himself, it is undeniable\nthat bushrā in Q 25:22 (on the day of judgement there will be no bushrā for the evildoers)\nmust mean “glad tidings” rather than merely “tidings” (CDKA 39; cf. also other uses of\nbushrā, such as Q 57:12; the point is also made in Stewart 2015, 197). Devin Stewart’s unitary\nconstrual of the verb bashshara is therefore preferable. It also fits the non- eschatological\nuses of b- sh- r just surveyed, where reference is clearly to joyous announcements, and the\nfact that istabshara is “to rejoice (in s.th.)” (e.g., Q 9:124, 30:48, 80:39).\nDiachronic remarks. The use of andhara commences already in the early Meccan\nperiod (e.g., Q 74:2, 78:40, 79:45, 92:14), while bashshara is at first employed only sarcas-\ntically (Q 84:24) and in relation to the promise received by Abraham that he is to have a\nson (Q 37:101, 51:28).

Where baʿatha means “to resurrect,” a usage already established in early Meccan\nsurahs (see Q 15:36, 26:87, 37:16.144, 56:47, 83:4), it efectively functions as an Arabic\nequivalent of Syriac naḥḥem (on which see SL 908). Much less frequently, “to resurrect”\nis expressed by the verb anshara (Q 21:21, 44:35, 80:22), which like → aḥyā is also used\nfor God’s restoration of “dead land” by means of rain (Q 43:11).\nBy contrast, ḥashara is “to gather, to assemb le,” corresponding to Syriac kannesh (Sinai\n2017a, 261; e.g., Beck 1972a, no. 1:501). It too can be employed non- eschatologically, as\nshown by Q 20:59, 27:17, or 79:23. Unlike baʿatha, ḥashara focuses not on the miracle of\nGod returning life to decomposed bodies (as foregrounded, e.g., in Q 17:49.98, 23:82, 37:16)\nbut on God’s universal rounding up of all h umans to await trial “without leaving out any\none of them” (Q 18:47: fa- lam nughādir minhum aḥadā). The general scenario resembles\nMatt 25:32, according to which “all the nations w ill be gathered (synachthēsontai, Peshitta:\nnetkannshūn) before” the Son of Man, who will “separate people one from another as a\nshepherd separates the sheep from the goats.” There is of course the diference that in the\nQur’an it is God rather than Jesus who functions as the eschatological judge (Rudolph 1922,\n36; El- Badawi 2014, 7, 185–186; Sinai 2017a, 246–247, n. 109; HCI 167).\nNominal usage. The noun baʿth, “resurrection,” occurs notably less often than the\ncorresponding verb and only appears in Q 22:5, 30:56 (which has two instances of yawm\nal- baʿth, “the day of resurrection”), and 31:28. The same is true for the noun ḥashr, “as-\nsembly” (only in Q 50:44; see also 59:2, where “the first assembling” may foreshadow the\nsecond, eschatological one). Slightly more frequent is nushūr, “resurrection” (Q 25:3.40,\n35:9, 67:15; see also 25:47). Far more regularly, the Qur’anic proclamations have recourse\nto al- dīn, “the judgement,” or yawm al- dīn, “the day of judgement” (→ dīn1), both of which\nfall into desuetude in the later Meccan period, and to → yawm al- ˻qiyāmah, “the day of\nresurrection,” which loans an established Christian Aramaic expression and remains in\nuse throughout all periods of the Qur’an’s genesis.\nbaʿīd | spatially distant; temporally distant; far- fetched, implausible,\nimprobable\n→ ashraka\nbaghtatan | suddenly\n→ sāʿah\nbaghḍāʾ | hatred\n→ ṣadr\nibtaghā tr. | to seek s.th.\nOn “seeking” the face of God, see under → allāh.\nibtaghā 137", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

They are treated one after the other.\nThe basic meaning of balā, ablā, and ibtalā. Extrapolating from Qur’anic usage, the\nbasic sense of the root b- l- w is discerning assessment and acquaintance. For example, Q 4:6\ninstructs the addressees to “assess orphans” (wa- btalū l- yatāmā) and to ascertain w hether\nthey are of sound mind (rushd) before letting them take control of their inheritance; ac-\ncording to Q 10:30, on the day of judgement “every one will come to be acquainted with\nwhat he has done previously” (hunālika tablū kullu nafsin mā aslafat); and Q 86:9 describes\nGod’s final judgement as “the day on which the secrets w ill be ascertained” (yawma tublā\nl- sarāʾiru). In line with this, a poem from the corpus of al- Nābighah employs the noun balāʾ\nin the sense of “acquaintance” (DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 26:2; cf. al- Ḥittī 1991, 179, n. 3,\nglossing balāʾ with al- ikhtibār wa- l- tajribah). Similarly, in a poem ascribed to Umayyah\nibn Abī l- Ṣalt, the serpent is said to have “experienced” or to “have become acquainted\nwith” God’s punishment (wa-q ad balathu; Schulthess 1911a, no. 28:6–7 = al-S aṭlī 1974,\nno. 69:6–7; on the poem, see Seidensticker 2011b, 49–50).\nMoral testing as the supreme purpose of God’s creation. The Qur’an is unequivocal\nthat God did not create the world or humans in par tic u lar without a purpose (Q 3:191,\n23:115, 38:27: bāṭilan, ʿabathan) or for play (Q 21:16, 44:38: lāʿibīn; see also under → ḥik-\nmah). Against this background, the verbs balā, ablā, and ibtalā play the vital theological\nrole of articulating the importance of moral discernment and discrimination in God’s\ncosmic plan. Thus, Q 11:7 and 67:2 declare that the ultimate objective of God’s creation of\nthe heavens and the earth or of life and death is to “put youp to the test, [in order to dis-\ncern] which one of you will act best” (li- yabluwakum ayyukum aḥsanu ʿamalan), a point\nthat is appropriately amplified by al- Māturīdī (al- Māturīdī 2005–2007, 7:133).

Other passages single out specific aspects of the created order\nthat serve the aim of moral testing. Thus, according to Q 6:165, God “has raised some of\nyoup over others in rank (→ darajah) in order to test you (li-y abluwakum) with re spect\nto what he has given you,” and Q 5:48 invokes the same rationale in order to explain that\nGod did not create humans as a single community (→ ummah). One Medinan verse,\nQ 33:72 (on which see under → wāthaqa), hints that humans have somehow primordially\nconsented to bearing the burden of moral responsibility that sets them apart from other\nparts of the created order. The point here seems to be that the pre- eschatological human\ncondition of being unremittingly subject to divine testing is something that humans can\nand ought to view as freely willed by themselves rather than as something externally\nimposed on them.\nDual testing by means of adversity and comfort. Q 89:15–16 teaches that divine\ntesting (verb: ibtalā) comes in two general types: God may either “honour” someone\nand “bestow grace upon him” (akramahu wa-n aʿʿamahu; see under → anʿama), for\nwhich the deity presumably expects appropriate gratitude; or God may curtail some-\none’s “provision” (rizq; see under → razaqa), that is, subject him or her to deprivation\nand hardship. The succinct description of human existence in Q 21:35 involves the same\nnotion of dual testing: “Every one will taste death; and we test youp with bad things and\ngood things (nablūkum bi- l- sharri wa- l- khayri), by way of a trial (fitnatan); and to us\nwill you be returned” (cf. Q 7:168, treated further below). The contention that is here\nintimated, that hardship and adversity serve as a means by which God establishes the\nmoral and religious merit and fortitude of humans, is the principal Qur’anic response\nto the question of how a just and omnipotent creator can permit or even bring about\nthe manifold types of pain and sufering that beset human existence and cannot be\nexplained as resulting from the sinful choices of free agents (see also under → ṣabara\nand → ẓalama).1 Such “natu ral evil,” as phi los o phers and theologians often term it, may\nalso be caused by the devil (Q 38:41), but as shown in the respective entry, the Qur’anic\ndevil (→ al-s hayṭān) is best understood as an agent who serves an overarching divine\nplan, however unwittingly, rather than as a genuine antagonist of the deity. As for the\nQur’anic categorisation not only of adversity but also of acts of divine grace as a “test,”\nthis may not be original to the Islamic scripture, given that similar language is attested by\na poem from the Zuhayr corpus: in return for the good they have done, a tribe’s leaders\nare said to have been “tested” by God “in the best way” (DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 14:29:\nfa-a blāhumā khayra l-b alāʾi lladhī yablū).2\nGod’s testing of Abraham and the Israelites. Several Qur’anic passages allude to God’s\ntesting of past individuals and groups. With one exception, consisting in the indeterminate\n“ owners of the garden” (aṣḥāb al- jannah) mentioned in Q 68:17, all of t hese instances relate\nto the Israelites and their patriarch Abraham. In the case of the latter, it is God’s command\nto sacrifice his son that is identified as “the clear test” (Q 37:106: al- balāʾ al- mubīn; see\nalso Q 2:124 and cf. Beck 1975a, 111–112), a statement echoing the opening of the Biblical\n1 However, t here are also verses, such as Q 42:30, that seem to suggest that inner- worldly sufering is a divine\npunishment.

As for Abraham’s Israelite descendants, it is above\nall their deliverance from Egyptian oppression that is cast as a “mighty test from yourp\nLord” (Q 2:49, 7:141, 14:6: fī dhālikum balāʾun min rabbikum ʿaẓīm; cf. 44:33). This too\nreflects the idea that divine testing may come in the guise of something positive. The same\nemerges from a scene in the life of Solomon that is narrated in Q 27:40: when the throne\nof the queen of Sabaʾ is miraculously transported before him, Solomon exclaims, “This\na favour from my Lord, to test me whether I will be grateful or ungrateful (li- yabluwanī\na- ashkuru am akfuru).” Fi nally, the dual form of divine testing is articulated once again in\nQ 7:168, which reports, similar to 21:35, that “we tested them”— namely, the Israelites—\n“with things good and bad” (wa-b alawnāhum bi-l -ḥ asanāti wa-l -s ayyiʾāti).3\nGod’s testing of the Medinan believers. The Qur’anic concept of divine testing receives\na novel inflection in Medinan passages that invoke divine testing in order to rationalise\nthe Qur’anic believers’ experience of hardship, strug gle, failure, and death (Q 2:155,\n3:152.154.186, 33:11, 47:4.31). For instance, Q 2:155 announces to the believers that God\nwill test them (la-n abluwannakum) “with fear and hunger and loss of possessions and\nlives and fruit; but giveS glad tidings to those who are steadfast” (→ bashshara, → ṣabara).\nThe idea of dual testing by things good and bad, too, reappears in a military context:\nQ 8:17 reminds the hearers that their victory in an armed encounter with their enemies\nconstituted a “good” or “benign test” (li- yubliya l- muʾminīna minhu balāʾan ḥasanan), the\nlikely implication being once again that God’s aid demands appropriate gratitude. In the\nMedinan Qur’an, God’s testing of the believers’ moral mettle thus comes to incorporate\nthe dauntless confrontation of martial peril. It is true that even in the Medinan Qur’an\ndivine testing is by no means confined to military matters: Q 5:94 casts the prohibition of\nkilling game while in a state of ritual consecration during the pilgrimage as a divine trial,\npresumably because it amounts to God denying the believers a certain privilege. But\nthe Medinan verses just cited do demonstrate that the Meccan notion of divine testing\nwas now infused with the novel expectation that “true believers” will be prepared to\n“contend” (→ jāhada)— i.e., take militant action— “on God’s path” (Q 8:74): the believers\nare not just expected to be unwaveringly ex pec tant that a decisive divine intervention,\nperhaps akin to the Noahic deluge, will chasten the repudiators and deliver the pious;\nthe believers come to be understood as agents enacting God’s deliverance rather than\njust forming its passive objects.\nDivine testing in Q 47:4. A particularly int ere st ing intersection between this activist\nturn and the notion of divine testing is found in Q 47:4 (Marshall 1999, 155–156; on this\nverse, see also u nder → jāhada). Reflecting the Medinan turn to militant activism, the first\nhalf of Q 47:4 exhorts the believers to fight “when you meet the repudiators,” though the\nmilitary objectives set out in what follows are still fairly l imited and do not yet require the\nrepudiators to convert to the Qur’anic religion (HCI 190). The second half of the verse then\nadds a theological comment: “If it w ere God’s w ill (law → shāʾa llāhu), he would be able\nto help himself against them (la-n taṣara minhum). It is only so that he might test some\nof youp by others (wa- lākin li-y abluwa baʿḍakum bi-b aʿḍin). As for t hose who are killed\non God’s path, he will not lead their works astray.” This second half of Q 47:4 addresses\na theological worry that might generally arise from the Medinan turn to activism: is God\n3 Divine testing of the Israelites also figures in Q 7:163 and 2:249.\n140 balā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In the passage at hand, this worry is made\neven more acute by the fact that a slightly l ater verse, Q 47:7, expressly urges the believ-\ners to “help God so that he might help youp” (in tanṣurū llāha yanṣurkum). Forestalling\nan overly literalist misunderstanding of this directive, Q 47:4 clarifies that God’s call for\nhuman action should not be taken to imply divine helplessness. Rather, God’s enlisting of\nhuman aid in implementing his designs merely serves his overarching purpose of gauging\nthe true extent to which human agents are committed to his cause.4\nFitnah as a divine trial. A second root used to express the notion of God’s testing of\nhuman moral worth is f- t- n, encompassing the verb fatana and the noun fitnah. According\nto classical Arabic lexicographers, fatana refers to the pro cess of putting gold or silver (or\nrather their ores) in a fire in order to separate the metal from the dross (AEL 2334; al-R āghib\nal-I ṣfahānī 2009, 623). The pro cess is described, albeit without the root f- t- n, in Q 13:17.5\nThat fatana has the basic sense of “to smelt” is borne out by the early Meccan verse Q 51:13,\nwhere this meaning yields the most satisfactory understanding: yawma hum ʿalā l- nāri yuf-\ntanūn, “the day on which they are smelted over the fire.” Given the express reference to fire,\nit would not be apposite to understand fatana in this verse to have only the more abstract\nmeaning “to put s.o. to the test,” even if this is undeniably the appropriate rendering for\nmany other occurrences of fatana. A fter all, the deniers of the judgement who are threatened\nwith perdition in this passage have already demonstrated, during their earthly lives, that\nthey do not belong to the “God-f earing,” who are treated from Q 51:15 onwards. Th ere is\nthus no properly moral testing left to be done on t hose whom the divine judge has already\ndispatched to hell; the only t hing that might be left to test is the sinners’ ability to endure\nthe never- ending torment of being roasted over the fire of hell. Q 51:13 thus presupposes\nrather clearly that the basic signification of fatana is “to smelt.”\nMuch more so than derivatives of b- l- w, those of f- t- n take not only God as an agent but\nalso humans (see below). Nonetheless, Q 21:35, already quoted above, shows that there\nexists at least partial synonymity between the two roots: “we test youp (nablūkum) with\nbad t hings and good t hings, by way of a trial (fitnatan).” Moreover, Q 39:49, in expressing\nthe above- mentioned doctrine of dual divine testing through affliction as well as bless-\nings, uses the term fitnah, and the idea that worldly goods might form a fitnah recurs in\nQ 8:28 and 64:15 (annamā/innamā amwālukum wa- awlādukum fitnatun; cf. also 20:131).\nThis corroborates that at least where God figures as the agent of the verb fatana and the\nnoun fitnah, they should be translated as “to put s.o. to the test” and “trial,” rather than as\n“to lead s.o. into temptation”: God orchestrates situations in which h umans must prove\ntheir value as moral agents, but there is no suggestion that he is actively pushing humans\ntowards failure or confronting them with insuperable odds. The fact that Q 7:27 predicates\nthe verb fatana of the devil (→ al- shayṭān) receives its explanation from several Qur’anic\npassages asserting that the dev il’s activity as a constant tempter of humankind rests on\ndivine permission (e.g., Q 15:36–43; see u nder → shayṭān). That God may employ the devil\n4 Pohlmann posits that the second part of Q 47:4 can only be an insertion that was secondarily added to the\nfirst part (Pohlmann 2018, 96–97 and 172–173); but I see no difficulty in considering the verse to form a cohesive\nutterance dating to one and the same point in time. This does not rule out the possibility, which would have to\nbe examined in a more detailed study, that Q 47:4 as a whole could be a later addition designed to preclude a\nproblematically literalist understanding of the call to “help God” in 47:7. The recurrence of n-ṣ - r in Q 47:4.7 is\nperceptively noted in Pohlmann 2018, 172.\n5 I owe my awareness of Q 13:17 in this context to Saqib Hussain.\nbalā 141", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Somewhat similarly,\nQ 2:102 casts two enigmatic angels, Hārūt and Mārūt, as acting in the same capacity of\ninstruments of divine testing (see QP 183–198 and also under → jinn). Both in Q 7:27 and\n2:102, therefore, it is really God who functions as the ultimate source of fitnah.\nQ 54:27 shows that a usage of fitnah in the sense of a divine trial of h umans’ moral mettle\nis already early Meccan: God sent the she- camel that he commanded the tribe of Thamūd to\nleave unmolested “as a trial for them” (fitnatan lahum). Another Meccan passage, Q 29:2–3,\naffirms that divine testing is God’s standard procedure across history, in line with some of\nthe statements using the root b- l- w examined above: “Do p eople think that they w ill be left\nto themselves simply b ecause they say, ‘We have espoused belief,’ and that they w ill not be\nput to the test (wa-h um lā yuftanūn)? // We certainly put to the test (fatannā) t hose before\nthem, and God w ill indeed come to know t hose who are truthful and t hose who are liars.”\nSpecific individuals subjected to such divine t rials who are identified in passages utilising\nthe root f- t- n include Moses (Q 20:40), the Israelites (Q 20:85.90), David (Q 38:24), and\nSolomon (Q 38:34), but also the “p eople of Phar aoh” (Q 44:17).\nF- t- n in connection with divine revelations. A distinctive aspect of f- t- n as opposed\nto b- l- w, when used to describe God’s testing of h umans, consists in the suggestion that\ncertain revelatory statements may function as a fitnah, or a means of divine discernment\nbetween believers and unbelievers. An example is the affirmation in Q 74:30 that t here\nare nineteen angels or demon-l ike minions who have been set up over the fire of hell. This\nseems to have triggered queries or objections, for the following verse (Q 74:31), a second-\nary addition to the surah, explains that the curiously precise quantification given in v. 30\nwas meant to function as a “trial (fitnatan) for the repudiators” (see Sinai 2017c, 73–75,\nand also the remarks on Q 74:31 under → bayyana and → mathal). As Q 74:31 explains, the\nappropriate response to the trial constituted by the preceding verse is to “have certainty”\nand to “increase in belief”; yet “t hose in whose hearts is sickness” (→ allādhīna fī qulūbihim\n˻maraḍun) and the repudiators (al- kāfirūn; → kafara) respond by saying, “What did God\nintend by employing this [namely, the statement in Q 74:30] as a mathal?” (mādhā arāda\nllāhu bi- hādhā mathalan), which is obviously understood as the incorrect response. The\nword mathal can express a fairly wide range of meanings in the Qur’an. Though it is often\ntranslatable as “similitude” or “likeness,” in Q 74:31 it is prob ably best understood to mean\nmerely a divine statement designed to elicit a diferential response, a connotation that is\nalso pre sent in 2:26 and 29:43, though in t hese latter two verses the mathal in question has\nthe character of a similitude as well. The word’s employment in Q 74:31, despite the fact\nthat it does not refer back to a proper similitude, is likely grounded in the fact that some\npassages in the New Testament attribute a similarly discerning efect to the parables of\nJesus (see under → mathal). For pre sent purposes, all of this confirms the sense in which\nthe noun fitnah is applied to divine revelations: they generate interpretive difficulties that\nserve to distinguish the good from the bad.\nAn analogous case is the Meccan verse Q 37:63. It states that the “tree of → al- zaqqūm”\nor “ingurgitation tree,” whose fruit the denizens of hell will be forced to eat according to\na number of passages (Q 37:64–66, 44:43–46, 56:52–53) is only meant to serve as a “trial\n(fitnatan) for the wrong- doers.” Taking inspiration from an undoubtedly apocryphal piece\nof narrative guesswork in the commentary lit er a ture (El- Awa 2006, 571–572; Radscheit\n2010, 101), one may conjecture that the putatively earliest reference to “trees of zaqqūm”\nin Q 56:52–53 proved bewildering to some of the Qur’anic hearers, which then led 37:63\n142 balā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

SPMC 235 and 239)\nand “the tree cursed in the qurʾān” (al- shajarah al- malʿūnah fī l- qurʾāni) w ere intended to\nserve as a “trial (fitnatan) for the p eople.” A similar use of fitnah is seen in the Medinan\npassage Q 22:52–53: none of God’s messengers or prophets is immune to having the devil\n(→ al-s hayṭān) cast fake inspirations into his mind; God, however, will retrospectively\nannul such Satanic promptings, “to make the dev il’s castings a trial (fitnatan) for t hose in\nwhose hearts is sickness and those whose hearts are hardened.” In all three passages just\ndiscussed in which fitnatan li-X occurs with a negative qualifier such as “the wrongdoers” or\n“the repudiators” (namely, Q 22:53, 37:63, 74:31), the force of the preposition li- is prob ably\nbest interpreted to mean “serving to identify X” rather than just “directed at X.”6\nA final passage in which the term fitnah is found in connection with the understanding of\ndivine revelations is Q 3:7, which censures “t hose in whose hearts is deviation” (alladhīna\nfī qulūbihim zayghun) for “following” the ambiguous portions of God’s scripture, “seeking\nfitnah and seeking its explanation” (ibtighāʾa l- fitnati wa- btighāʾa taʾwīlihi). Unlike Q 17:60,\n22:53, 37:63, and 74:31, however, the ultimate responsibility for fitnah is not unequivocally\nimputed to God h ere but rather to h umans. This occurrence is therefore more appropriately\ndiscussed in the following section.\nHumans as agents of fitnah. Unlike derivatives of b- l- w, fatana and fitnah often occur\nwith agents other than God. In many such cases, a suitable translation of fatana will be\n“to lead s.o. into temptation,” though as I shall argue at the end of the entry there are also\noccurrences for which “to afflict s.o.” is a preferable rendering. We saw above that Q 7:27\nwarns the children of Adam not to let the devil (→ al- shayṭān) tempt them; but in most\ncases of non- divine fitnah the perpetrators are other h umans who are in some way pitted\nagainst the Qur’anic believers, either as external enemies of the believers’ community or\nas subversive ele ments on the inside. Such human- on- human fitnah is virtually always\nviewed negatively and considered to stem from malevolent and sinful motifs: to subject\nhumans to moral testing is evidently treated as a divine prerogative,7 although God may\nof course enlist other agents like the devil to serve as instruments of moral testing on his\nbehalf (see above).\nFatana and fitnah in the sense of h umans leading other h umans into temptation is in ev-\nidence from the Meccan period onwards. Q 37:161–162 address the Messenger’s adversaries\nby saying, “Youp and that which you serve // will not be able to tempt anyone against him\n(mā antum ʿalayhi bi- fātinīn),” namely, against God (but see KK 419 and CDKA 208, who\n6 This consideration may also illuminate the occurrence of fitnatan li- in Q 10:85 and 60:4–5, where those\nfollowing Moses and Abraham pray that God might not make them “a fitnah for the wrongdoers/repudiators”\n(see KK 227).\n7 A pos si ble exception is Q 9:49, where some people are said to demand of the Qur’anic Messenger lā\ntaftinnī, which in this context must express a plea to be spared from combat and should prob ably be translated\n“Do not put me to the test.” However, the text does not confirm that the Messenger is indeed engaged in such\ntesting. The continuation of the verse plays on the dif er ent meanings of f- t- n by accusing the people in question\nof having themselves “fallen into fitnah” (a- lā fī l- fitnati saqaṭū). Read in context, this is best understood to mean\n“having fallen into the activity of stirring up temptation,” since this is what the preceding two verses criticise.\nbalā 143", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In addition, according to Q 17:73 the Messenger’s oppo-\nnents “almost succeeded” in “tempting” or “luring him away from” God’s revelations (wa-\nin kādū la- yaftinūnaka ʿani lladhī awḥaynā ilayka). In two Medinan passages containing\nnegative comments on those “desiring fitnah,” fitnah would also seem to signify nefarious\nhuman attempts to plant doubts and foster dissension among the believers, the objective\nbeing to tempt or lure them away from divine truth (Q 3:7, 9:47–48). In Q 3:7, “seeking\nfitnah” (ibtighāʾa l-fi tnati) is said to motivate t hose who deliberately cling to and press\nthose Qur’anic passages that are ambiguous (see also under → bayyana), while 9:47–48\ncomplain that a certain group of persons who proved averse to embarking on what appears\nto be a military campaign would have “sought to stir up temptation” among the believers\n(v. 47: yabghūnakumu l- fitnata) had they joined them. Indeed, the prospective culprits are\nsaid to have done so before (v. 48: la- qadi btaghawu l- fitnata min qablu). Another case\nin which fitnah clearly means “temptation” is the phrase suʾilū l- fitnata, “to be incited to\n[give in to] temptation,” in Q 33:14.\nIn other instances in which h umans, and specifically unbelievers, figure as grammatical\nsubjects of the verb fatana, the meaning of the latter would seem to be something like\n“to put s.o.— specifically, the believers—to the test by subjecting them to harassment and\npersecution.” More concisely, this may be rendered as “to afflict s.o.,” though many En glish\ntranslators opt for “to persecute” (which can be contextually appropriate). Fatana in the\nsense of “to afflict s.o.” is already found in Meccan passages, as shown by Q 29:10 (where\nfitnat al- nās is “being afflicted by the p eople,” in opposition to “God’s punishment,” ʿadhāb\nallāh) and 10:83 (where the Israelites fear that Pha raoh and his notables “might afflict\nthem,” an yaftinahum).8 The same meaning is operative in the Medinan verses Q 2:191.217.\nThey justify the injunction to fight the repudiators and to “expel them from where they\nexpelled you,” if needs be by conducting war during the sacred season (→ ḥarrama), by\nasserting that fitnah— i.e., afflicting, harassing, or persecuting believers—“ is worse than\nkilling” (al- fitnatu ashaddu/akbaru mina l-q atli). In both cases, the text would seem to be\nweighing up the ways in which the unbelievers have previously harassed, mistreated, and\noppressed the believers against the vio lence that the latter are now urged to inflict in re-\nsponse. It is likely that in Q 2:193 and 8:39, too— where the believers are urged to fight “ until\nthere is no more fitnah and religious worship is directed at God” or “religious worship in\nits entirety is directed at God” (wa- qātilūhum ḥattā lā takūna fitnatun wa-y akūna l- dīnu ±​\n<kulluhu> li- llāhi; see also u nder → jāhada)—fi tnah means affliction sufered by t hose who\nprofess belief in God.9 Another case in which fatana is “to afflict” is Q 4:101, which justifies\n8 Q 16:110, which similarly employs the passive futina in the sense of “to be afflicted,” is a Medinan insertion\n(see also Neuwirth 2007, 301). The same applies to Q 85:10, threatening with damnation t hose who “afflict the\nbelieving men and women and then do not repent” (PP 336–337).\n9 The alternative would be to understand both verses to refer to the elimination not merely of the threats or\n“affliction” emanating from an enemy community but of the general danger of believers being led into temptation\nby other humans practising a dif er ent dīn (cf. Ṭab. 3:299–300, glossing fitnah as shirk). However, we can be\nreasonably confident that Q 2:191 uses fitnah in the sense of “affliction,” making it likely that the same meaning\nis in play two verses later. In addition, Medinan pronouncements about the “hypocrites” (→ al-m unāfiqūn)\nand “ those in whose hearts is sickness” (→ alladhīna fī qulūbihim ˻maraḍ) imply that nominal membership of\nthe community of believers as such does not at all ensure full compliance with the commands of “God and his\nMessenger” that is demanded by the Qur’anic proclamations. Indeed, Q 9:47–49 clearly imply that fitnah or\ntemptation can arise from within the circle of t hose who profess outward loyalty to the Messenger while their\nhearts continue to harbour doubt.

This\naccords with an early Meccan verse implying that the Qur’anic God is the “Lord of this\nhouse” (Q 106:3: rabb hādhā al-b ayt; cf. also 27:91, which has rabb hādhihi l- baldati lladhī\nḥarramahā, “the Lord of this town, who declared it to be inviolable”) as well as a string\nof passages, both Meccan and Medinan, in which God figures as the one responsible for\nestablishing the Meccan shrine or the town’s sacred status (Q 2:125, 5:97, 22:26, 27:91,\n28:57, 29:67; see also 3:96, which is in the passive voice but plausibly taken to imply di-\nvine establishment as well). Several of the verses just referenced associate the origin of\nthe Meccan sanctuary with the figure of Abraham (Q 2:125–127, 3:97, 14:37, 22:26–29).\nIn Q 22:29.33, the “house” accordingly takes the epithet ʿatīq, “ancient,” while the early\nMeccan verse Q 52:4 calls it al-b ayt al-m aʿmūr, perhaps “the house visited [by pilgrims]”\n(see u nder → ʿamara).\nIn the Hebrew Bible, the Jerusalem temple is at least on one occasion described as\nthe dwelling place of God or of his “glory” (kābôd; 1 Kgs 8:10–13, but see 1 Kgs 8:27; cf.\nPs 132:14). It may be that a similar notion originally underpinned Arabian references to\nthe Kaʿbah as God’s “house”; but it is unlikely that by the time of the Qur’an the Meccan\nsanctuary was still understood to be God’s dwelling place in any literal sense, seeing that\nGod is explic itly described as “he who is in heaven” (Q 67:16–17: man fī l- samāʾi). Instead,\nthe Meccan “house” is characterised in terms of its ritual and other roles for h uman wor-\nshippers (e.g., Q 2:125, 3:96–97, 5:97).3 Perhaps the clearest confirmation of this obser-\nvation is the fact that the second principal designation of the Meccan shrine, apart from\nformulations employing the word bayt, is “the inviolable/sacred place of prostration” (al-\nmasjid al-ḥ arām; e.g., Q 2:144.149.150; → sajada, → ḥarrama). In line with this, prostration\n(verb: → sajada) figures among the ritual acts that worshippers at God’s house are said to\nperform (Q 2:125, 22:26). In addition, rituals that are in some sense connected with the\nMeccan sanctuary include circumambulation (see below), prayer (Q 2:125, 8:35; → ṣallā),\nbowing (verb: rakaʿa; see Q 2:125, 22:26), but also animal sacrifices (see Q 2:196, 5:95,\n22:32–33, 48:25; → dhabaḥa). The latter aspect, it is worth noting, stands in tension with\nwhat became the standard practice in post- Qur’anic Islam, according to which “it is not\nusual to ofer an animal at all when making an ʿumrah, and the animals that are slaughtered\nas part of the ḥaǧǧ ritual are killed at Minā outside Mecca” (Hawting 2019, 102). Most likely,\nthe Qur’anic text h ere reflects an archaic state of afairs that was gradually superseded (see\nalso the early post- Qur’anic evidence for the Kaʿbah as a place of animal sacrifices that is\nnoted in Hawting 2019, 102–103).\n2 Carlos Segovia would presumably disagree with this deflationary solution of the prob lem; see Amir- Moezzi\nand Dye 2019, 2:154. It must be conceded that the hypothesis of assimilation of bi- makkata to bi- bakkata is un-\nabashedly ad hoc, in so far as the Qur’an’s canonical rasm is by no means devoid of cases in which bi- is followed\nby a word beginning with the letter mīm (though t here is also no occurrence of bi- makkata; Q 48:24 has bi- baṭni\nmakkata). One might also object that assimilation in Classical Arabic is predominantly regressive (as exemplified\nby the behaviour of the definite article, which in many cases assimilates to the initial consonant of the following\nword) rather than progressive (Alfozan 1989, 80–83). Still, at least the general phenomenon of progressive assim-\nilation is not entirely absent from Arabic (Ryding 2014, 23–25). This is illustrated by the behaviour of infixed t in\neighth- form verbs (iftaʿala) whose consonantal roots begin with certain letters (e.g., iddaghama < * idtaghama;\nsee also Fischer 2002, 27). On Q 3:96, see also the comment in Sinai 2014, 520.\n3 A similar shift of emphasis can perhaps be seen in the manner in which Q 22:37 reconceptualises the\nrationale for ofering sacrifices to God (see under → dhabaḥa).\n146 bayt", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Given that the Qur’anic “house” is a sanctuary devoted to and\nestablished at the behest of God, it has been suggested that bayt, when used to refer to the\nMeccan shrine, is to be idiomatically translated as “t emple” (thus Stewart 2021, 30–32). As\nStewart argues, this adequately reflects the Arabic word’s ostensible “weight of veneration”\nand also the fact that the Hebrew Bible, in line with ancient Near Eastern terminology more\ngenerally, commonly refers to the Jerusalem t emple by using the cognate word bayit (e.g,\n1 Kgs 3:1; see TDOT 2:111–113). Jacqueline Chabbi has expressed reservations against ren-\ndering bayt as “t emple,” in so far as the cult at the Kaʿbah mainly seems to have taken place\non the outside of the building, involving ritual circumambulation (Q 2:125.158, 22:26.29:\nṭāfa/taṭawwafa) as an impor tant elem ent (Chabbi 2020, 38–39, 51).4 However, w hether\none considers the idea of a t emple to imply regular cultic activity on the inside is perhaps a\nmatter of definition, and w hether we have adequate knowledge of what, if anything, went\non inside the Kaʿbah is in any case open to doubt (see also Stewart 2021, 32). In favour of\nrendering al-b ayt as “the temple,” moreover, one may point to two Medinan passages,\nQ 2:124–129 and 3:96–97, that are clearly concerned to cast the Meccan sanctuary as equiv-\nalent or even superior to the Jerusalem t emple (HCI 205–206). For example, Q 3:96–97\nspeak of the Meccan sanctuary as “the first h ouse [of worship] established for the p eople”\nand describe it as “blessed” (mubārak), an attribute recalling e arlier Qur’anic allusions to\nthe Holy Land, or “the land that we have blessed” (Q 21:71.81: al- arḍ allatī bāraknā fīhā;\ncf. Q 7:137, 17:1, 34:18; see u nder → arḍ and → qaddasa). The point of calling the Meccan\nsanctuary—w hich according to the Qur’an was founded by Abraham (Q 2:125–127, 3:97,\n22:26)—t he “first h ouse” is presumably to credit it with sen iority over the Jerusalem t emple,\nwhose establishment the Biblical tradition associates only with David.5\nAgainst Stewart’s recommended policy, however, it can be objected that no Qur’anic\npassage explic itly applies the term bayt to the Israelite sanctuary in Jerusalem: in Q 17:1.7,\nthe latter is called a → masjid, a “place of prostration,” while Q 3:37.39 and 19:11 refer to it\nby using the term miḥrāb, whose original meaning in early Arabic may have been “palace”\nor “throne room” but which in Surahs 3 and 19 is best rendered as “sanctuary” (Horovitz\n1927, 261–262).6 The evidence that the Jerusalem temple was commonly referred to as a\nbayt by speakers of Arabic at the time of the Qur’an is thus not conclusive. It is true, as\nnoted earlier, that certain Qur’anic passages are concerned to draw a parallel between\nthe Meccan Kaʿbah and the Jerusalem temple; yet such a parallelisation should not be\n4 On ritual circumambulation in the Qur’an, see also Christiansen 2019.\n5 One might compare this with Jacob of Sarug’s attempt to establish the priority of Edessa over Jerusalem\n(Popa 2019).\n6 For an overview of the debate about the word’s etymology and original meaning, see Fehérvári 1993,\n7; for attestations in pre- Islamic and early post- Qur’anic poetry and an analy sis of Qur’anic usage, see, among\nothers, NB 52, n. 3, and Horovitz 1927, 260–263. The word also occurs in Q 38:21, describing how two disputants\nsought out David in the miḥrāb to ask him to adjudicate between them. While one might expect the scene to\ntake place in David’s palace rather than the temple (cf. 2 Sam 12, where David only departs to the “house of the\nLord” in v. 20, a fter which he returns to his own house), the Qur’anic narrative could well be set in the temple\nin its entirety. However, Ambros (following Horovitz 1927, 261, and Paret 2001) translates miḥrāb at Q 38:21 as\n“palace,” alongside 34:13 (which has the plural maḥārīb; CDKA 68). That miḥrāb could mean a palace or throne\nroom seems clear from the poetic testimonies adduced by Horovitz and others. According to Horovitz, the use\nof miḥrāb as a designation for the Israelite t emple in Q 3:37.39 and 19:11 is a secondary expansion of this original\nmeaning. This hypothesis remains highly plausible, as does Horovitz’s conjecture that the development may have\ntaken place under the impact of the similar- sounding Ethiopic word mәkwrāb (“ temple, sanctuary, synagogue”;\nLeslau 1991, 341). It is impor tant to highlight that Horovitz is not claiming that miḥrāb is to be etymologically\nderived from mәkwrāb.\nbayt 147", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is not to rule out, however,\nthat a Medinan passage like Q 3:96–97 with its tangible polemical subtext builds on an\nawareness among some of its recipients that in Jewish tradition the Jerusalem temple is\ncommonly called bēt ha- miqdash in Hebrew or be/bet maqdsha in Aramaic (DTTM 829;\nDJBA 215 and 701). But this is a plausible guess rather than a certainty. In sum, though\nthere are some valid reasons for translating al- bayt al- ḥarām etc. as “the sacred t emple,”\nlegitimate scope for disagreement remains.\nThe Meccan sanctuary: a contextual sketch. That Mecca was the site of a sacrificial\nsanctuary of transtribal significance is confirmed by allusions in pre- Qur’anic poetry, which\nalso refers to “God’s house” (bayt allāh) or the “Lord” (rabb) of “the house” and of Mecca\n(Sinai 2019b, 52–53). The Meccan sanctuary was moreover located in the vicinity of Mount\nʿArafah or ʿArafāt, the point of departure of the annual → ḥajj ritual, which may have begun\nto fuse with the cult of the Meccan sanctuary already in the pre- Qur’anic period. It would\nappear that the Quraysh, who seem to have gained control over Mecca at some point in\nthe fifth century (Peters 1994b, 10–18; see also Sinai, forthcoming a), made deliberate\neforts to augment the sacrality of Mecca, or to engage in what Jacqueline Chabbi has\ntermed a “capitalisation of the sacred” (Chabbi 2020, 50). They are, for instance, reported\nto have moved the “black stone,” a betyl (i.e., an aniconic sacred stone) now forming part\nof the Kaʿbah, from a nearby mountaintop to the site of the Meccan shrine (Rubin 1986,\n118–124). The theology of subordination that the Qur’an attributes to Muhammad’s pagan\nopponents, according to which other deities—s uch as the trio Allāt, al-ʿ Uzzā, and Manāt\n(Q 53:19–22)– were recognised as intermediaries between humans and Allāh, the patron\ndeity of the Meccan shrine, and as his d aughters (→ ashraka),7 may likewise have been a\nmeans of asserting Mecca’s ultimate supremacy over competing sanctuaries and of ensuring\nits appeal to as large a cultic constituency as pos si ble. The result of such endeavours would\nseem to have been a “polybetylic” ensemble (Chabbi 2020, 48) accumulating a plurality\nof sacred stones, figures, and sacrificial stones, to go by post- Qur’anic Islamic sources\n(Rubin 1986, 104–106), but which in its entirety was believed to be under the custody of\nAllāh, the “Lord (rabb) of the house,” whose protective solicitude for Mecca, its sacred\nprecinct (ḥaram), and its inhabitants is emphasised in several Qur’anic passages (Q 27:91,\n28:57, 29:67, 106:4).\nIt is noteworthy that a verse by the Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd presupposes that the\n“Lord of Mecca” is identical with the “Lord of the cross,” i.e., with the Biblical God (al-\nMuʿaybid 1965, no. 3:10; see Sinai 2019b, 52). In view of this, it may well be the case that\nthe Meccan sanctuary was recognised not only by pagans but also by some Christians\nand Jews (for some pos si ble traces of this in post- Qur’anic lit er a ture, see Rubin 1990,\n109). This hypothesis would fit the observation that Islamic sources exhibit isolated\ntraces of a Christian presence in Mecca, such as a “cemetery of the Christians” (Shahîd\n1989, 387, 390–392). The Kaʿbah’s ac cep tance by tribes professing (some version of)\n7 On the question of whether the patron of the Kaʿbah was Allāh or Hubal, see Sinai 2019b, 52–53 and 58, n.\n283 (tending towards the supposition that Hubal was secondarily co- opted into the Kaʿbah cult, in addition to the\nsanctuary’s true patron deity Allāh). On accounts to the efect that the Kaʿbah contained a statue of Hubal, see now\nalso O’Meara 2020, 109–110. As O’Meara remarks, it is striking that most reports of Muhammad’s destruction of\nthe idols within the Kaʿbah upon his gaining control of Mecca do not mention Hubal (O’Meara 2020, 113). This\ncould be an indication that the Islamic source’s stress on Hubal’s importance in rituals performed in and around\nthe pre- Islamic Kaʿbah is an exaggeration.\n148 bayt", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Numerous Qur’anic passages associate divine revelation with the notion of clar-\nity, expressed by the root b- y- n.

(li-) , “to make s.th. clear (to s.o.),” or intransitive bayyana\n(li-) , “to make t hings clear (for s.o.)” (e.g., Q 2:118.159.187.219.221.230.242.266). The direct\nobject of God’s clarifying activity often consists in “his signs” or “the signs”; the (dis-\ntinctly Medinan) formulation that God “clarifies” or “renders clear” his signs for someone\n(bayyana āyātihi li-) is prob ably equivalent to the statement that he “sent down clear signs”\n(nazzala/anzala āyātin bayyinātin/mubayyinātin; e.g., Q 2:99, 24:1.34.46, 57:9, 58:5; see\nalso 22:16). Less frequently, the grammatical subjects of bayyana are human agents, such\nas Jesus (Q 43:63), the Qur’anic Messenger (Q 5:15.19, 16:44.64), or God’s messengers in\ngeneral (Q 14:4).2 In such cases, the point would seem to be that God’s emissaries faithfully\ncommunicate the immanent clarity of the divine message, in line with verses attributing\nto the Qur’anic Messenger the task of “clear delivery” (al- balāgh al- mubīn). A peculiar\nfeature of the Medinan surahs, which is discussed elsewhere (see under → al- ʿālamūn),\nconsists in the fact that Muhammad is bidden to “make things clear” (bayyana) not just to\nthe scriptureless but also to the custodians of prior scriptural revelations, that is, to Jews\nand Christians (Q 3:20, 5:15.19; see also the likely Medinan insertion Q 16:44).3\nIn a few cases (Q 2:118.230, 6:105), the verb bayyana occurs as part of a verse-fi nal flourish\ntogether with a prepositional syntagm introduced by li- qawmin. An example is the divine\nvoice’s statement in Q 2:118 that “we have indeed clarified the signs to people who have\ncertainty (li- qawmin yūqinūn).” This syntactic pattern is also found with other verbs, and\nas shown elsewhere is prob ably equivalent with a consecutive clause that would disrupt the\nrhyme (see in detail u nder → faṣṣala), meaning that “we have indeed clarified the signs to\npeople who have certainty” has the same purport as “we have indeed clarified the signs\nso that p eople might have certainty.” The theologically significant implication of this analy-\nsis is that verse-fi nal occurrences of li- qawmin + verb in the prefix conjugation cannot be\nadduced to show that the target audience of divine clarification is confined to those who\nhave already espoused belief.\nThe meaning of mubīn and mubayyin. Some of the translations in the preceding section\npresuppose that the active participle mubīn, derived from the fourth-f orm verb abāna,\ndoes not have a transitive force in Qur’anic usage, such that it would mean “clarifying”\n(see the overview of common interpretations of mubīn in Birnstiel 2018, 47–53). Rather,\nas argued in detail by Devin Stewart, Qur’anic mubīn functions as a verse-fi nal equivalent\nof bayyin (Stewart, forthcoming). In fact, the Qur’an’s sole verbal occurrence of abāna in\nQ 43:52 (which is also verse-fi nal) is intransitive, with the meaning “to express o.s. clearly”\n1 Balāgh denotes both God’s “message” and its “transmission” or “delivery” by divinely chosen emissaries\nsuch as Muhammad; see CDKA 44.\n2 See also Q 3:187, where it is the scripture- owners who are charged to “make it”—i .e., the scripture—“ clear\nto the people and not to conceal it.” See on this verse the remarks under → wāthaqa.\n3 For a tentative argument in favour of Q 16:44 being Medinan, see again under → al-ʿ ālamūn.\n150 bayyana", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It may be that this exhibits a general semantic potential of the Arabic fourth\nverbal form, which Fred Leemhuis describes as an “internal causative” (Leemhuis 1977,\n38–65), a meaning that is captured by formulations such as “to show oneself to be s.th.,”\n“to allow o.s. to be or do s.th.”4 If that is correct, then the use of abāna and mubīn in the\nsense of “expressing o.s. clearly” or “showing o.s. to be clear” (see Leemhuis 1977, 50–51)\nwould exhibit a regular sense of the fourth- form verb abāna rather than forming a case of\npoetic licence or “cognate substitution” (on which see Stewart 2009, 20–25). In any case,\nthe fact that mubīn is not “clarifying” but “clear” is also evident from verses in which the\nword figures as an adjective joined to nouns like ʿaduww, “ enemy” (e.g., Q 2:168.208,\n4:101, 6:142), and ḍalāl, “ going astray” (e.g., Q 3:164, 6:74, 7:60, 12:8.30), where reference\nis clearly not to any act of transitive clarification.\nMore problematic than mubīn is the second-f orm participle mubayyin: unlike abāna,\nbayyana is undeniably a transitive verb in the Qur’an (e.g., Q 2:68–70.118.159); yet in the\nMedinan phrases fāḥishah mubayyinah (Q 4:19, 33:30, 65:1) and āyāt mubayyināt\n(Q 24:34.46, 65:11), the active participle mubayyin is best understood as an equivalent of\nbayyin or mubīn (cf. the phrase āyāt bayyināt in Q 2:99.211, 3:97, 10:15, 17:101 etc.). Thus,\nfāḥishah mubayyinah is presumably “a clear abomination,” while āyāt mubayyināt are “clear\nsigns,” notwithstanding the fact that a literal translation might run “clarifying abomination”\nand “clarifying signs.” As Leemhuis suggests, adopting the reading variants mubayyanah/\nmubayyanāt, which replace the active participle by a passive one, would be one way of\nremoving the prob lem (Leemhuis 1977, 52–53; see, e.g., MQQ 2:120). Such a passive read-\ning receives further support from a verse in the poetic corpus of Ṭarafah, which has al-ẓ ulm\nal- mubayyan for “manifest wrongdoing” (DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 1:4; cf. Jacobi 1971, 146).\nAgainst the background of Qur’anic usage, however, one might of course rather expect a\nfeminine form of the fourth- form active participle mubīn. While the Qur’an’s Ḥafṣ ʿan\nʿĀṣim reading is entirely devoid of the feminine form mubīnah, early Qur’anic manuscripts\nlacking diacritics would have spelled both mubayyinah/mubayyanah and mubīnah identi-\ncally as هىىىم. As noted by Stewart, it is therefore conceivable that the original wording was\nmubīnah, especially given that all Qur’anic occurrences of mubayyinah and mubayyināt\nare verse-i nternal and the choice is therefore unconstrained by rhyme. It must, however,\nbe said that the qirāʾāt lit er a ture ofers only isolated evidence for the reading variant\nmubīnah instead of mubayyinah (MQQ 1:120 and MQ 2:42, on Q 4:19).5\nA dif ere nt non-t ransitive interpretation of mubīn is advocated by Daniel Birnstiel (Birn-\nstiel 2018), to whom Stewart is responding. Based on a detailed review of other Qur’anic oc-\ncurrences of mubīn, Birnstiel argues that the Qur’anic claim to have been revealed bi- lisānin\nʿarabiyyin mubīn (Q 26:195) does not mean “in clear Arabic language” but rather “clearly\nin Arabic,” in the sense that the Qur’an’s Arabicness is readily apparent and easily ascer-\ntainable. Such an adverbial manner of parsing the meaning of Qur’anic mubīn is frequently\n4 As Leemhuis explains, internal causatives “form a sub- group of the causative; they only do not indicate\nthat the subject causes someone else to be, or do, something, but that the subject causes itself to be, or do,\nsomething. The omission of the object (or of one of the objects) that is expected serves as the indication that\nsubject and object are identical (except of course when the unmentioned object is clearly understood from the\ncontext) which explains why both sorts of meanings can be found for the H stem of one and the same lexical\nroot” (Leemhuis 1977, 40–41).\n5 On the prob lem of the second-s tem participle, see also Birnstiel 2018, 84–88, who opts for textual variants\nthat read mubayyinah as mubayyanah. Stewart prefers to emend mubayyinah to bayyinah.\nbayyana 151", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

A similar reservation holds for al-\nkitāb al- mubīn in Q 12:1 and elsewhere, for which Birnstiel proposes “the scripture that can\nbe identified as such” (Birnstiel 2018, 73).

Some Qur’anic verses pre sent the clarity and clar-\nification vouchsafed by revelation as the antidote to h uman disagreement and squabbling:\nGod “only sent down the scripture to youS”— namely, to the Qur’anic Messenger— “so\nthat you might clarify to them that about which they disagree” (wa- mā anzalnā ʿalayka\nl- kitāba illā li-t ubayyina lahumu lladhī khtalafū fīhi; Q 16:64; cf. 27:76), and in Q 5:15.19 the\nQur’anic Messenger is given the role of “making things clear” to the “scripture- owners”\n(→ ˻ahl al- kitāb), whom 5:15 accuses of “hiding” the scripture. Similarly, Jesus was sent to\nprovide clarity regarding “some of the things regarding which youp”— namely, his Israelite\naudience— “are in disagreement” (Q 43:63). Yet the lucidity of God’s revelations does not\nproduce unfailing h uman assent, for past recipients of God’s revelations are said to have\n“fallen into disagreement” (ikhtalafa) even after clear signs or scriptural revelations had\ncome to them (Q 2:213.253, 3:105; cf. also 3:19, 11:110, 19:37, 41:45, and 45:17).8 The per-\nspicuity of divine communications, therefore, does not preclude that some of its h uman\naddressees may nonetheless wilfully and culpably misconstrue God’s signs. Indeed, Q 2:253\nmakes it clear that t hose who “fall into disagreement” in the wake of God’s clear signs divide\ninto believers (man → āmana) and repudiators (man → kafara; cf. also Q 3:19 and 19:37):\nwhether h umans allow themselves to be infused by the clarity of God’s address is, in the\nlast instance, a volitional act, a decision between belief and unbelief. It is only at God’s\nfinal judgement that t here will be no further room for h uman misunderstanding, for on\n6 Like Stewart, I see l ittle reason to follow Birnstiel’s assessment that bi- sulṭānin bayyinin at Q 18:15 has a\nsubtly dif er ent meaning from verse- final occurrences of bi- sulṭānin mubīn (e.g., 14:10, 27:21; see Birnstiel 2018,\n80–81); and I would agree with Stewart’s claim that the crucial diference between the two cases is whether the\nadjective is in verse-fi nal position (in which case rhyme may require mubīn) rather than in verse-i nternal position.\n7 One might of course respond to this challenge by positing that Arabic was a language characterised by\nmantic prestige, a language associated with super natural inspiration of some kind; but such a theory would\nefectively need to be read into the Qur’an, which ofers little support for it. For a slightly dif er ent take on the\nmeaning of mubīn, see Larcher 2020, 116–118. Larcher suggests that the fourth-f orm verb abāna, of which mubīn\nis the active participle, is implicitly reflexive (which would yield a sense like “self-c larifying”) and that mubīn is\nequivalent with mustabīn at Q 37:117, for which a reflexive sense is morphologically expected. My main reservation\nwith regard to Larcher’s treatment is that it fails to consider rhyme.\n8 On ikhtalafa and related terms, see also under → ummah, → ḥizb, and → al- naṣārā.\n152 bayyana", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The proper\nresponse to the clarity of divine revelation, though a response to which previous humans\nhave consistently failed to live up, is communal concord. The Qur’anic believers are ac-\ncordingly admonished not to follow the negative prec e dent of earlier generations: “Hold\nfast to God’s rope, all together, and do not become divided” (wa- ʿtaṣimū bi- ḥabli llāhi\njamīʿan wa- lā tafarraqū), Q 3:103 says,9 and two verses on (Q 3:105), we find the further\nexhortation, “Do not be like t hose who fell into divisions and disagreement (tafarraqū wa-\nkhtalafū) after the clear signs had come to them; those will have a great punishment” (cf.\nQ 98:4).10 The Qur’anic awareness that the unity of the believers is a precious good whose\nloss w ill entail the danger of eschatological perdition persisted well into the post- Qur’anic\nperiod; even the well- known dictum attributed to Muhammad that “disagreement in my\ncommunity is an expression of divine mercy” (ikhtilāf ummatī raḥmah) may not originally\nhave been meant to vaunt pluralism but rather to formulate the hope that the emergence\nof reprehensible disagreement within the Muslim ummah would be treated leniently by\nGod (Paret 1979; van Ess 2017–2020, 4:731–732).\nScriptural clarity in the Qur’an and in the Christian tradition. The Qur’anic stress\non the clarity of divine revelations is usefully compared with Christian reflections on\nthe clarity of scripture (though the topic no doubt deserves a more sustained treatment\nthan is pos si ble here). Proto- orthodox Christians and those following in their wake were\ncommitted both to the canonical status of the Hebrew Bible and to vari ous doctrines\n(e.g., that the death of Jesus was the crucial soteriological event in human history and\nthat Jesus was si mul ta neously human and divine) that are not literally enunciated by the\nHebrew Bible, at least not from the perspective of a reader not yet beholden to the truth\nof Chris tian ity. As a result, an early Christian thinker like Irenaeus of Lyon was forced to\nadmit that Biblical prophecies, before their fulfilment in Christ, are enigmatic and am-\nbiguous; yet “when the time has arrived, and the prediction has come to pass, then the\nprophecies have a clear and certain exposition.” To the Jews, however, the “law” is “like a\nfable; for they do not possess the explanation of all t hings pertaining to the advent of the\n9 Paret links the meta phor of “God’s rope” in Q 3:103 with the expression “grasping the firmest handhold”\n(istamsaka bi- l- ʿurwati l- wuthqā) in Q 2:256 and 31:22 (KK 76). Note, though, that “grasping the firmest hand-\nhold” is only a meta phor for belief in God rather than for preserving the unity of the community of believers.\n10 For another occurrence of tafarraqa, “to become divided,” in a warning against religious divisions, see\nQ 42:13–14, perhaps also 6:153.

The meaning\nof scripture, then, is fully capable of elucidation— provided that scripture is read from a\nChristian vantage point. As a result, scripture’s true meaning, despite being potentially\nlucid, does not command universal assent: “the entire Scriptures, the prophets, and the\nGospels, can be clearly, unambiguously, and harmoniously understood by all, although\nall do not believe them” (Roberts et al. 1995, 1:398 = Irenaeus, Against Heresies, book 2,\nch. 27:2). Mainstream Christ ian ity, of whom Irenaeus is an early representative, is thus\ndisposed to recognise that scriptural prophecies were not clearly intelligible to humans\nat the point of delivery and require subsequent fulfilment in order to become fully com-\nprehensible. By way of an illustration, according to Jacob of Sarug it was only with the\nnativity of Christ that “all the words of prophecy have come into efect, and the Hidden\nMystery (rāzā kasyā) has appeared openly (etā l- gelyā) to show itself” (Kollamparampil\n2010, 196–197, ll. 91–92). By contrast, the Qur’an—w ith the exception of one passage, to\nbe discussed at the end of the entry—is able to claim perfect clarity already at the point\nof delivery. Yet like Irenaeus, the Islamic scripture nonetheless anticipates that “all do not\nbelieve” God’s clear signs: whether one opens oneself up to God’s clear address or not is,\nultimately, a decision between belief and unbelief that may go e ither way, irrespective of\nthe intrinsic lucidity with which God communicates.\nEarly Meccan passages to do with the clarity of God’s revelations. The prevalent\nQur’anic association between divine revelations and clarity forms a constant of Qur’anic\ntheology throughout all stages of the text’s emergence and is fully established already\nin the early Meccan period. This is worth illustrating in more detail. Thus, Q 51:50–51\ndeclares—in the form of a first- person statement that is evidently meant to be an utter-\nance of the Qur’anic Messenger rather than of God— that “I am a clear warner (nadhīr\nmubīn; → bashshara) from him,” namely, from God, “to youp.” This has another early\nMeccan parallel in Q 15:89, while the early Meccan verse Q 26:115 attributes a similar self-\nidentification to Noah (“I am only a clear warner”). Subsequently, declarations to the same\nefect recur in several l ater Meccan verses, both as statements by or about the Qur’anic Mes-\nsenger and as utterances of Noah (Q 7:184, 11:25, 22:49,11 29:50, 38:70, 46:9, 67:26, 71:2).\nThe importance attaching to the concept of God- given clarity already in the early Meccan\nperiod is further illustrated by Q 55:4, affirming that it was God who “taught” humans\n“clear speech” (ʿallamahu l-b ayān), and Q 26:195, one of a handful of Qur’anic verses\nstressing that Muhammad’s revelations are “in clear Arabic language” (bi- lisānin ʿarabiyyin\nmubīn; → ʿarabī). Moreover, two other early Meccan verses, Q 52:38 and 37:156, challenge\nthe Messenger’s adversaries to produce “clear authority (→ sulṭān),” while Q 51:38 con-\ntends that Moses was sent to Pha raoh with precisely such “clear authority” (see also the\nchronologically later references to “clear authority” in Q 4:91.144.153, 11:96, 14:10, 23:45,\n27:21, 40:23, 44:19; 18:15 has sulṭān bayyin).

H ere, the divine voice warns the Messenger not to be hasty in announcing\nthe revelations he receives (cf. also Q 20:114). Instead, the Messenger is to await and then\n“follow” God’s recitation (Q 75:18). Q 75:19 adds that it w ill then be incumbent upon God to\n“clarify” what he has revealed (thumma inna ʿalaynā bayānah).13 This equates to the promise\nthat God’s revelations w ill, if necessary, be interpreted by l ater ones: the divine speaker him-\nself w ill see to it that his messages are clearly understandable. This programmatic statement\nis remarkable b ecause t here is good literary evidence elsewhere in the Qur’an that this is\nindeed what happened: it can be shown that vario us Qur’anic statements that seem to have\ngiven rise to interpretive queries w ere retrospectively elucidated or modified in chrono-\nlogically subsequent proclamations, e ither by means of a l ater insertion into the passage at\nstake or by means of targeted allusions in other surahs (Sinai 2018b and HCI 150–153; see also\nSinai 2021, 367–373, 378–380, 384–386). In this sense, the Qur’anic revelations w ere engaged\nin maintaining and curating their own clarity, by having recourse to certain techniques of\nself-i nterpretation that allow for precise philological description. We s hall have reason to\nreturn to this observation in the next and final section of the entry.\nQ 3:7 and scriptural ambiguity. As shown by many of the preceding references, the\nidea that divine revelation is both inherently clear and a source of clarity continues to be\nprominent throughout the l ater Meccan and Medinan stages of the Qur’an’s genesis. An\narresting exception to this general stance, however, is found in Q 3:7. The verse concedes\nthat some of the “signs” revealed to the Qur’anic Messenger are in fact ambiguous (mu-\ntashābih, literally “resembling one another”),14 as opposed to other signs that are “firmly\ncrafted” (muḥkam) and form the unequivocal core of God’s scripture, or the “ mother of the\nscripture” (umm al- kitāb; see also u nder → kitāb). This, the verse alleges, enables “t hose in\nwhose hearts is deviation” to create discord and confusion in the community by seeking\nthe “explanation” (taʾwīl)15 of such ambiguous portions of God’s revelations, despite the\nfact that their understanding is limited to God alone.16 The correct attitude, by contrast,\nis modelled by those “firmly grounded in knowledge” (al-r āsikhūna fī l- ʿilmi), who are\ndepicted as proclaiming: “We believe in it; all of it”—i .e., w hether clear or ambiguous—“ is\n12 Overall, Surah 37 contains five verses that have e ither mubīn or, once, mustabīn in rhyme position (vv. 15,\n106, 113, 117, 156).\n13 Bayān is the verbal noun corresponding to the first-f orm verb bāna, which is not attested in the Qur’an.\nGiven that Q 75:19 employs the noun bayān with an object suffix whereas bāna is usually intransitive, one sus-\npects that bayān here operates as a cognate substitute for the second- form verbal noun tabyīn (corresponding\nto the transitive verb bayyana). This would make Q 75:19 the inverse of 105:2, where the second- form verbal\nnoun taḍlīl stands in for ḍalāl (Müller 1969, 46–50; Stewart 2009, 21). In both cases, the reason is clearly the\nmaintenance of rhyme.\n14 That the root sh- b- h can connote a perceived absence of clarity is confirmed by Q 2:70, where the Israel-\nites, whom Moses orders to sacrifice a certain cow, demand additional divine clarification (verb: bayyana) since\nto their eyes all cows allegedly “resemble one another” or “are indistinguishable from another” (inna l- baqara\ntashābaha ʿalaynā).\n15 On taʾwīl in the sense of “explanation” or “interpretation” (e.g., of dreams), see also 12:6.21.36.37.44.45.100.101,\n18:78.82. As Ambros notes (CDKA 31), in some of its occurrences the word can or must mean something like\n“ultimate outcome” (e.g., Q 4:59, 17:35) rather than “explanation,” though one can see how its basic sense of\nreturning something to its origin could have given rise to both of these more specific senses.\n16 See also the remarks on Q 3:7 and the term fitnah under → balā.\nbayyana 155", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The discrep-\nancy between Q 3:7 and the Qur’an’s other wise pronounced insistence on the immanent\nclarity of God’s signs is striking.\nComparison with Q 75:19 throws into relief what is perhaps the most salient feature\nof Q 3:7: the latter verse does not anticipate that the acknowledged need of certain reve-\nlations for “explanation” will be met by further revelations. It is relevant here to reiterate\nthe observation made above that the Qur’anic corpus comprises a considerable number\nof examples for the kind of scriptural self- interpretation envisaged in Q 75:19. This makes\nit all the more notable that Q 3:7 does not expect cases of scriptural ambiguity to be set-\ntled by means of the Qur’an’s well- established repertoire of techniques of retrospective\nself- clarification. An attractive way of accounting for this fact, and also for Q 3:7’s general\nincongruity with the Qur’anic topos of the clarity of God’s revelations, is to contemplate\nthat Q 3:7, or rather the verse group containing it (Q 3:7–9), postdates the end of Mu-\nhammad’s proclamatory activity and reflects a situation in which the Qur’anic corpus\nwas by and large considered to have reached closure (Chabbi 2020, 88; HCI 52–54). If\nso, Q 3:7 would document how members of the very early post- prophetic community\ntook stock of the scriptural canon that had emerged during Muhammad’s lifetime and\ngrappled with the discrepancy between the Qur’an’s frequent claims to clarity, on the\none hand, and the factual equivocity of some of its component passages, on the other. It\nbears underlining that this scenario implies that the author or authors of Q 3:7 must have\nassumed that large-s cale expansion or revision of the Qur’anic corpus—i .e., the wholesale\naddition of longer passages and entire surahs, or significant rewriting of the existing\nscriptural stock— was not feasible anymore, for other wise cases of scriptural ambiguity\ncould simply have been dealt with by means of appropriate additions to or alterations\nof the par tic u lar passages at hand. Moreover, if Q 3:7 is indeed post- prophetic, manu-\nscript evidence requires it to have been incorporated into the Qur’anic corpus within a\nfew years of Muhammad’s death, at least if currently available radiocarbon datings are\naccepted (HCI 54). Thus, the overall impression that the Qur’anic corpus was closed\nvery soon after Muhammad’s demise (Sinai 2014, 520) would continue to stand even if\nQ 3:7 were classed as post- prophetic.18\n17 There is a well-k nown dispute over where to pause in reciting Q 3:7, which afects the question w hether\nthe understanding of ambiguous portions of God’s scripture is confined to God or also extends to t hose who are\n“firmly rooted in knowledge.” See the overview in Wild 2003, which references previous studies. Unlike Wild,\nwho considers both readings of the verse to be equally viable, I continue to hold that the first interpretation is\nmore plausible than the second one (Sinai 2006, 128–129).\n18 In addition to Q 3:7’s strikingly idiosyncratic position on the clarity of divine revelation, the verse also\nexhibits a certain terminological discontinuity with the rest of the Qur’an, but this is prob ably less conclusive. For\ninstance, as noted in HCI 53, Q 3:7 uses the expression umm al- kitāb (“the mother of the scripture”) in a dif er ent\nsense than its two earlier occurrences in 13:39 and 43:4: there, the “ mother” or perhaps “source” of the scripture\nis the celestial scripture that functions both as a comprehensive rec ord of every thing that has happened and will\nhappen and as the archetype of the Qur’anic revelations (see u nder → kitāb), while Q 3:7 applies the phrase umm\nal- kitāb to the “firmly crafted” and unequivocal core of the Qur’anic corpus. However, as Saqib Hussain plausibly\nobjects, the fact that Q 13:39 and 43:4 are both Meccan opens up the possibility of viewing the dif er ent meaning\n156 bayyana", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:179", "title": "Page 179", "locator": "pdf_page:179", "text": "A further passage that is relevant in this context is Q 74:30–31,19 which belongs to a\nsurah that is mostly early Meccan. Q 74:30 caps of an enigmatic and ominous description\nof hell- fire by saying that t here are “nineteen” unspecified beings set up over it. The fol-\nlowing verse, Q 74:31, is clearly a later addition (Sinai 2017c, 73–75) and explains that the\nnineteen beings in question are angels who function as masters or guardians of hell- fire\n(wa- mā jaʿalnā aṣḥāba l- nāri illā malāʾikatan . . .). What seems to have happened is that\nthe curiously specific piece of information that the number of the angelic guardians of hell\nis nineteen in Q 74:30 occasioned interpretive queries among the Qur’an’s addressees,\nwhich in turn necessitated a subsequent comment that was inserted at 74:31. As noted\nabove, similar interpretive comments and additions are found in other Qur’anic passages,\ntoo (Sinai 2018b); yet Q 74:31 does not merely provide retrospective clarification for a cer-\ntain Qur’anic statement but also intimates a general rationale why God’s revelation might\ngive rise to interpretive queries in the first place. Similar to Q 3:7, this rationale revolves\naround the claim that some of God’s revelatory communications form a “trial” (fitnah) for\nthose whose hearts are diseased (alladhīna fī qulūbihim zayghun/maraḍun), an idea that is\nalready seen, albeit in a more succinct form, in the Meccan verse Q 37:63 (see the remarks\non fitnah under → balā; see also under → mathal).20 Moreover, both Q 74:31 and 3:7 insist\nthat the ultimate meaning or rationale of the revelatory utterance or utterances in question\nis known only to God (Q 3:7: wa- mā yaʿlamu taʾwīlahu illā llāhu; 74:31: wa- mā yaʿlamu\njunūda rabbika illā huwa).21 Against the background of such commonalities, however,\nQ 3:7 goes further than 74:31 by articulating a systematic subdivision of scriptural state-\nments into clear and ambiguous, a taxonomy that is absent from 74:31.\nIt is difficult to decide what all of this means for the question w hether Q 3:7 postdates\nthe death of Muhammad. The preceding parallels between Q 3:7 and 74:31 certainly raise\nthe possibility that the explicit admission of scriptural ambiguity in the former verse arose\nfrom incipient hermeneutical reflections of the sort that are also attested in Q 74:31. One\nmight conclude, therefore, that the bipartite taxonomy of scriptural utterances found in\nQ 3:7 could feasibly have emerged during the lifetime of Muhammad, by way of a further\ndevelopment and systematisation of 74:31 (and also 37:63). Still, there remains a notable\ndiscrepancy between the emphasis that many Meccan and Medinan statements place on\nthe clarity of God’s revelations, on the one hand, and the recognition of irresolvable scrip-\ntural ambiguity in Q 3:7, on the other. In fact, in so far as Q 74:31 clarifies the meaning of\nthe immediately preceding verse, by explaining that the “nineteen” beings that are set up\nover hell-fi re (as per v. 30) are angels, v. 31 is precisely an instance of the type of Qur’anic\nself- interpretation that is programmatically announced in Q 75:19. Q 3:7, by contrast,\nwould seem to be bracing its readers for the recognition that the Islamic scripture contains\nat least some ambiguous passages for which revelatory self-i nterpretation of the kind ex-\nemplified by Q 74:31 is simply not available. This is a distinct perspective that could very\nwell reflect the situation of the earliest post- prophetic community. As for the indubitable\nof the expression umm al- kitāb in 3:7 merely as a case of discontinuity between Meccan and Medinan language\nrather than as indicating a post- prophetic insertion.\n19 I owe this observation to comments by Saqib Hussain on a draft version of the pre sent entry.\n20 Cf. also the use of fitnah in Q 22:52–53, noted under → balā.\n21 In addition, both Q 3:7 and 74:31 conclude by stressing that the utterances in question function as reve-\nlatory reminders (wa- mā yadhdhakkaru illā . . . / wa- mā hiya illā dhikrā li- . . .). My awareness of all of t hese\nphraseological overlaps between Q 3:7 and 74:31 is due to Saqib Hussain.\nbayyana 157", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Similarly to Q 3:7, 2 Pet 3:16 ac-\nknowledges that the scriptural corpus recognised by the author contains ambiguities that\naford his opponents unwelcome exegetical ammunition; and the Qur’anic reference to\nthose “firmly grounded in knowledge” (al- rāsikhūna fī l- ʿilmi), who refrain from pressing\nthe equivocal portions of scripture, looks like the positive mirror image of those “lacking\nin knowledge and in stability” (hoi amatheis kai astēriktoi), whom 2 Pet 3:16 accuses of\nmalevolently twisting difficult passages in the letters of Paul.24 At the very least, the parallel\ndemonstrates that the manner in which Q 3:7 seeks to come to terms with the presence of\nirreducible ambiguity in the Qur’anic corpus is not unprec e dented. In addition, however,\nthe Second Epistle of Peter has long been suspected of pseudonymity (for an overview of\nthe debate on the date of 2 Pet, see, e.g., Ehrmann 2012, 485–487, and Barton and Mud-\ndiman 2001, 1270–1272). The hypothesis of pseudonymity certainly explains very neatly\nwhy 2 Pet 3:15–16 can look back to the letters of Paul as a textual corpus that is sufficiently\nauthoritative in order to be exegetically contentious. But if 2 Pet is indeed most convinc-\ningly dated some time a fter the Pauline corpus, this lends credence to the supposition that\na similar gap obtains between Q 3:7 and the remainder of the Qur’an.\n22 Another permutation would be to consider a post- prophetic dating for Q 74:31 as well.\n23 See already Wild 2006a, 18 (crediting the pre sent author).\n24 There is only one other Qur’anic occurrence of “ those firmly grounded in knowledge.” It comes in\nQ 4:161–162, a passage distinguishing between two groups of Jews: t hose who are “repudiators” (v. 161) and\n“ those of them who are firmly grounded in knowledge and believers” (v. 162: al- rāsikhūna fī l- ʿilmi minhum wa-\nl- muʾminūna). The latter are said to believe not only in pre- Qur’anic revelations but also in “what was sent down\nto youS,” i.e., to the Qur’anic Messenger.\n158 bayyana", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The idea of ethico- religious “following,” in the sense of an active commitment to\n(or against) divine guidance and t hose who summon to it, abounds throughout the Islamic\nscripture. Together with the notions of guidance (→ hadā), straying (→ ḍalla), and God’s\nroad (→ ṣirāṭ) or path (→ sabīl), that of followership belongs to a pivotal Qur’anic f amily\nof concepts that encode right and wrong in spatial terms: God and his messengers ofer\nguidance and orientation, but it remains up to h umans to set out in the direction indicated\nand to resist the specious appeal of alternative sources of orientation, such as ancestral\nprec ed ent or one’s desires (see below).1 The Qur’anic idea of followership may have Biblical\nroots like the condemnation of “ going a fter” other Gods (e.g., Deut 4:3, 6:14) and the New\nTestamental habit of describing discipleship of Jesus as “following” him (akoloutheō, which\nusually becomes ezal bātreh in the Peshitta; see, e.g., Matt 4:18–22, 8:10.18–22.23; for an\noverview of the Biblical data, refer to TDNT 1:210–215). However, the Qur’anic notion of\nfollowing God’s guidance and messengers is arguably more pervasive than in the Bible. It\nalso lacks the connotation of instabilitas loci that characterises discipleship of Jesus, even if\nbeing prepared to leave home and kin for the sake of God did become a prominent aspect\nof the Qur’anic ideal of belief in the wake of the Qur’anic believers’ hijrah or emigration\nto Medina (see under → hājara).\nObjects of tabiʿa and ittabaʿa. In the Qur’an, ethico- religious “following” is expressed\nby the verbs tabiʿa and, more frequently, ittabaʿa (on both of which see the overview in\nCDKA 48).

The Qur’an employs the verb tāba in two distinct but com-\nplementary meanings, both of which revolve around the notion of God and humans\nre- turning to one another (Zirker 1993, 100). First, tāba ilā llāh is “to turn to God in re-\npentance” (Q 2:54, 5:74, 7:143, 11:3.52.61.90, 24:31, 25:71, 46:15, 66:4.8). Sometimes tāba\nis used without a prepositional complement introduced by ilā, in which case it means “to\nrepent” simpliciter (Q 2:160.279, 3:89, 4:16.17.18.146, 5:34.39, 6:54, 7:153, 9:3.5.11.74.126,\n11:112, 16:119, 19:60, 20:82, 24:5, 25:70.71, 28:67, 40:7, 49:11, 85:10). That tāba has a con-\nnotation of spatial turning is confirmed not only by the preposition ilā, but also by several\nverses in which tāba or tāba ilā are opposed to tawallā, “to turn away” (Q 9:3.74, 11:3.52).\nTāba ilā llāh is close in meaning to istaghfara llāha, “to ask for God’s forgiveness,” as shown\nby the pairing of tāba and istaghfara in Q 5:74 and 11:3.52.61.90 (for other verses combin-\ning t- w- b and istaghfara, see Q 4:64 and 40:7, and 110:3).1 Another formulation that is at\nleast partially synonymous is anāba (ilā llāh), “to entrust o.s. to God, to turn or return\nto God,” which in some—b ut by no means all— cases (Q 38:24.34, 39:54) “follows upon\nthe commitment of a sin; in these places an addition of ‘repentantly’ is justified” (CDKA\n276).2 Tāba in the sense of human repentance is frequently coupled with derivatives of\nthe root ṣ-l - ḥ that refer to d oing right eous deeds, such as aṣlaḥa (e.g., Q 4:16.146, 5:39,\n6:54, 16:119, 24:5) or ʿamila ±​<ʿamalan>​→ ṣāliḥan (e.g., Q 19:60, 20:82, 25:70.71, 28:67,\nmany of which also include believing, on which see u nder → āmana). This indicates that\nrepentance has not only a retrospective dimension, consisting in the acknowledgement\nof past failures, but also and perhaps more importantly a forwards-l ooking dimension, a\nresolve to do better in the future.\nSecondly, tāba ʿalā is said of God as the grammatical subject and takes humans as the\nprepositional object. It signifies God’s compassionate and forgiving “turning towards”\na human sinner (Q 2:37.54.128.160.187, 3:128, 4:17.26.27, 5:39.71, 9:15.27.102.106.117.118,\n20:122, 33:24.73, 58:13, 73:20). This second use of tāba is semantically close to ghafara\n(+ acc.) li- , “to forgive s.o. (s.th.),” and raḥima + acc., “to have mercy upon s.o.” Thus,\naccording to Q 7:23 Adam and Eve, after having eaten from the forbidden tree, plead with\nGod to “forgive” them and to “have mercy” upon them, and two other passages would\nseem to report the fulfilment of this request by saying that God “turned t owards” Adam\n1 For a Palaeo-A rabic inscription containing the phrase yastaghfiru rabbahu, “he asks for God’s forgiveness,”\nsee Al- Jallad and Sidky 2021, 9.\n2 Note also that in Q 38:24, anāba is placed in a sequence of three verbs beginning with istaghfara rabbahu,\n“he asked God for his forgiveness.”\ntāba 161", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is in part this observable association of t- w- b, r-ḥ - m, and\ngh- f- r that justifies the paraphrastic rendering of tāba ʿalā by “to turn to s.o. in forgiveness\nor in compassion.”\nThe relationship between h uman repentance and divine relenting. Both the Meccan\nand the Medinan corpus affirm that God “accepts repentance from his servants” (Q 9:104,\n42:25: yaqbalu l- tawbata ʿan ʿibādihi; see also 40:3, describing God as “the forgiver of sins\nand the one accepting repentance,” ghāfiri l- dhanbi wa- qābili l- tawbi) and in consequence\n“erases evil acts” (Q 42:25: wa- yaʿfū ʿani l- sayyiʾāti). Already in Q 20:82, likely e arlier than\nthe three passages just referenced, the divine voice affirms that “I forgive t hose who repent\nand do right eous deeds and then allow themselves to be guided” (wa- innī la- ghaffārun li-\nman tāba wa-ā mana wa-ʿ amila ṣāliḥan thumma htadā). As borne out by the double use of\ntāba or other derivatives of t- w- b in Q 2:54.160, 4:16.17, and 5:39, the human act of “turn-\ning towards” (tāba ilā) God typically precedes God’s forgiving “turning t owards” (tāba\nʿalā) h umans: divine forgiveness thus responds to h uman repentance.5 This impression is\ncorroborated by further verses in which divine clemency follows upon h uman penitence\n(Q 3:89, 5:34.74, 6:54, 7:153, 9:102, 16:119, 24:5, 25:70, 66:8; see also 110:3). It is noteworthy\nthat the same general pattern—a h uman action followed by a divine response in kind—is\nalso exemplified by affirmations that h uman scheming (k- y- d, m- k- r) w ill be countered by\ndivine scheming (e.g., Q 3:54 or 86:15–16; see u nder → makara) or that h uman forgetfulness\nof God w ill give rise to divine forgetfulness of h umans (e.g., Q 9:67; → nasiya).6\nIn one Medinan passage, however, the standard sequence of human remorse and\nsubsequent divine pardon is exceptionally inverted and it is God’s relenting that precedes\nhuman repentance rather than vice versa: according to Q 9:118 (on which see also Reyn-\nolds 2020, 105), God “turned towards” three unnamed individuals who had been “left\nbehind” (khullifū) so that they would “turn to God” (thumma tāba ʿalayhim li-y atūbū). If\nthis statement is picked out in isolation, it appears to depict God as the one who initiates\nthe pro cess of repentance and forgiveness, perhaps implying a loose Qur’anic equivalent\n3 I am thus suggesting that Q 2:37 and 20:122 are best read as presupposing that God’s turning t owards Adam\nwas preceded by Adam’s repentant turning t owards God. This reading is not invalidated by the fact that Q 20:122\nis, in my view, chronologically e arlier than Q 7:23, given that Surah 7 has a significantly higher mean verse length.\n4 Exceptionally, the term tawwāb (in the plural) is applied to h umans Q 2:222, requiring the meaning “t hose\never ready to repent.”\n5 The Qur’an does not strictly pre sent h uman penitence as forming a necessary condition for obtaining divine\npardon, since Q 9:15.27 assert that God “turns in forgiveness to whomever he wills.” In a similar vein, Q 33:24\nholds open the possibility that God might decide to relent towards the hypocrites. Yet those whom God does\nin fact w ill to forgive may well be t hose who deserve to be forgiven, on account of prior repentance (see also\nunder → shāʾa and → hadā), and this may also be tacitly envisaged as a requirement for divine forgiveness towards\nthe hypocrites in Q 33:24. A similar reading is v iable for Q 9:106 (God may either punish or turn in forgiveness).\n6 See also Q 17:8 (wa-i n udtum ʿudnā) and 47:7 (in tanṣurū llāha yanṣurkum). Another case where the nexus\nbetween human action and a divine response in kind takes a positive form is Q 2:152: “remember me, and I s hall\nremember youp” (fa- dhkurūnī adhkurkum).\n162 tāba", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is however pertinent to remember that the preceding verse,\nQ 9:117, begins by affirming that “God turns (or has turned) in forgiveness to the Prophet\nand the emigrants and the helpers (la-q ad tāba llāhu ʿalā l-n abiyyi wa-l -m uhājirīna wa-l -\nanṣāri) who followed him [the Prophet] in the hour of difficulty.” Although Q 9:117 adds\nthat the hearts of some of them “had almost swerved” (min baʿdi mā kāda yazīghu qulūbu\nfarīqin minhum), God’s “turning towards” humans in Q 9:117–118 clearly takes place vis-\nà- vis a group of persons who have amply demonstrated their firm commitment to God\nand his revelation. Divine relenting here seems to become almost a byword for God’s\ngeneral fortification of those who have previously rallied to his cause, as a result of which\ntheir hearts are shielded from subsequent swerving.7 In fact, going back a bit further in\nthe text, Q 9:112 contains a list of what appear to be the vari ous positive attributes of the\nbelievers, which is opened by “ those who turn in repentance” (al-t āʾibūn). God’s turning\ntowards “the Prophet, the emigrants, and the helpers” in v. 117 and then again to some of\nthem in v. 118 may thus be deemed to react to the believers’ penitence as specified a few\nverses earlier. In fact, Surah 9 as a whole, fittingly called Sūrat al- Tawbah, is marked by\na very high incidence of derivatives of t-w -b from beginning to end (Q 9:3.5.11.15.27.74.\n102.104.106.112.117.118.126), interlacing multiple instances of human and divine turning.\nIn view of this, it seems unlikely that Q 9:118 should be considered to articulate a general\nclaim to the efect that the dynamic of human repentance and divine forgiveness might\ncommence with the latter.\nDivinely sent messengers and the question of vicarious pleading for divine for-\ngiveness. Some verses suggest that the Qur’an accords divinely appointed messengers\nlike Muhammad the ability to seek divine forgiveness on behalf of o thers, especially on\nbehalf of t hose who follow them (istaghfara li-; Q 3:159, 4:64, 24:62, 47:19, 48:11, 60:12,\n63:5). However, other verses make it very clear that this is not an unconditional power\nof vicarious intercession (see Reynolds 2020, 107–109): God will not forgive those who\n“find fault” with and deride believers even if Muhammad w ere to ask forgiveness for them\nseventy times, Q 9:79–80 insist (see also Q 63:6), and according to Q 9:113 both the Prophet\nand the believers are subject to a general interdiction on asking for divine forgiveness on\nbehalf of unbelievers or associators even if the latter should be relatives. H uman pleas for\nforgiveness on behalf of someone else accordingly seem to require personal involvement\nof the individual to be forgiven. A messenger may supplement and amplify genuine ex-\npressions of remorse by his followers: if p eople who have committed wrong “ask for God’s\nforgiveness and the Messengers asks for forgiveness on their behalf” (Q 4:64: fa- staghfarū\nllāha wa-s taghfara lahumu l- rasūlu), then God will prove himself to be ever- relenting and\nmerciful. But a messenger may not, as it were, override a sinner’s determined rejection of\nGod.8 Parenthetically, the doctrine that one must not seek divine forgiveness on behalf\nof repudiators, which is specifically Medinan, stands in tension with Meccan passages re-\ncounting how Abraham promised his idolatrous f ather to ask God to forgive him (Q 19:47;\nsee also 14:41 and 26:86). This tension is negotiated in Medinan comments on the scene\n7 A similar dynamic of initial human commitment to God and subsequent divine fortification may perhaps\nbe perceived in the sequence of believing (āmana) in God and the believer’s heart then “coming to be secure”\nor “at peace” (iṭmaʾanna) in his belief as a result of divine fortification (Q 2:260 and 5:111–113).

In a limited number of places, the Qur’an seems\nconcerned to circumscribe more precisely the conditions that govern w hether h uman re-\npentance is acceptable to God. Three passages, Q 4:17 (occurring in a Medinan surah) as\nwell as Q 6:54 and 16:119 (occurring in Meccan surahs),9 stipulate that it is in par tic ul ar t hose\nwho have committed an evil action (al- sūʾa or sūʾan) “in ignorance” (bi- jahālatin) and sub-\nsequently repent who may count on God’s p ardon (on Q 6:54 see also u nder → a l- raḥmān).\nWhat could be the chronologically latest one of t hese three passages, Q 4:17, adds the further\nproviso that the culprits are to repent soon a fter their misstep (min qarībin).\nInversely, two further Medinan verses specify cases in which God will refuse to accept\nhuman penitence. One of them, Q 3:90, pertains to apostates and insists that those who\nhave relapsed into repudiation after having been believers and who have subsequently\n“increased further in repudiation” (thumma zdādū kufran) will not have their repen-\ntance accepted. The other verse is Q 4:18, which follows one of the above statements\nabout committing a sin “in ignorance” (see also Reynolds 2020, 106). Q 4:18 rules out\nthat God’s lenient “turning towards” humans might benefit (wa-l aysati l-t awbatu li- ),\nfirst, someone who has deliberately delayed repenting until the moment of his death,\nevidently in the hope of tapping into God’s forgiveness without having to bear any prac-\ntical consequences, and, secondly, those who die as repudiators, i.e., without any act\nof repentance at all.\nTaken together, the Medinan couplet Q 4:17–18 thus bespeaks a concern to delineate\nwith increasing precision the conditions of valid repentance.10 It is relevant to note that\nwhat occasions this discussion of the par ameters of valid and invalid repentance in its\nimmediate literary context is the preceding pronouncement in Q 4:16 that two com-\nmunity members who are guilty of unspecified “abominations” (al-f āḥishah; see CDKA\n209) are not to be punished if they “repent and act righ teously” (fa-in tābā wa-a ṣlaḥā).\nQ 4:16 thus shows that in the Medinan setting some form of public repentance could have\nthe consequence of averting penal liabilities. The same holds for Q 5:33–34 and 5:38–39,\nwhere repentance is said to avert the harsh punishments for “waging war against God\nand his Messenger” and for theft.11 It would seem, therefore, that the incipient casuistic\napproach to the prob lem of valid repentance that is vis i ble in Q 4:17–18 and also in 3:90\nis to be located in a social context in which Qur’anic values and notions increasingly in-\nformed the ways in which deviance from certain behavioural expectations was concretely\nenforced. That penitence was an act with a tangible practical dimension is, by the way,\nalso confirmed by the provision that the Qur’anic Messenger is to exact a gift of charity\n9 At least for Q 16:119, a Meccan dating cannot be treated as self- evident, seeing that the preceding verse\ngroup 16:114–118 is almost certainly a later insertion (Sinai 2019c, 130–131).\n10 One might compare this with Q 9:113, also Medinan, where it is stipulated that one must not seek God’s\nforgiveness (verb: istaghfara) on behalf of associators, “even if they are kinsfolk”: here, too, the text exhibits a\npreoccupation with circumscribing with greater precision the conditions under which what might be deemed\na personal act of prayer is legitimate and efficacious.

Tāba and tawbah in the\nsense of human penitence are clearly reminiscent of the way in which the New Testament\nuses the verb metanoeō (literally, “to change one’s mind”) and the corresponding noun\nmetanoia (e.g., Matt 3:2.8.11, 4:17, 11:20). Tāba and tawbah also recall the Biblical Hebrew\nverb šāb, “to turn around, to turn back, to repent,” sometimes used with the preposition\nel, “to” (namely, God; e.g., 1 Kgs 8:33.48 and Isa 44:22; see HALOT 1429–1430 and the\ndetailed overview of relevant Biblical and extra-B iblical material in TDNT 4:975–1008 and\nNIDOTTE 4:55–59). Šāb el and its Syriac equivalent tāb lwāt (SL 1625–1626) are cognates\nof Arabic tāba ilā, although it should be noted that in rendering passages whose Hebrew\noriginal has šāb, the Peshitta often opts for etpnī rather than tāb (not so at 1 Kgs 8:33,\nhowever). The verses from Matthew just cited, in any case, do employ tāb and the corre-\nsponding noun tyābūtā, and the Jewish Aramaic Bible translations Targum Onqelos (on the\nPentateuch) and Targum Jonathan (on the Prophets) are more consistent in using tāb for\nHebrew šāb.12 What follows is a brief concluding attempt to assess the likely pedigree of\nQur’anic tāba and tawbah in light of the lexical correspondences just highlighted. A more\nin- depth exploration of late antique notions of repentance and penitence in comparison\nwith the Qur’an remains a desideratum.\nPerhaps the most compelling indication that the Qur’anic use of tāba is continuous with\nand rooted in Biblical diction is the observation that in the Hebrew Bible, as in the Qur’an,\nit is not only h umans who engage in penitent turning, but also God (cf. NIDOTTE 4:57–58).\nFor instance, Zechariah proclaims, “Thus says the Lord of hosts: turn back to me (šûbû ēlay;\nPeshitta: etpnaw lwāt), says the Lord of hosts, and I will turn back to you (wәʾāšûb ălêkem;\nPeshitta: w- etpnē ʿlaykon), says the Lord of hosts” (Zech 1:3), and the same slogan—“ Turn\nback to me, and I w ill turn back to you”—is found in Mal 3:7. The correspondence with\nQur’anic statements in which the h uman act of penitently “turning t owards” (tāba ilā) God\nprecedes God’s forgiving “turning towards” (tāba ʿalā) h umans is unmistakable h ere (as\nconcisely noted already in BEḲ 39).13 Moreover, even though the Peshitta on Zech 1:3 and\nMal 3:7 does not render šāb by its Syriac cognate tāb but uses etpnī instead, it arrestingly\ndeparts from the Hebrew text of the Bible by employing dif ere nt prepositions for h uman\nand divine turning, namely, lwāt and ʿal. This neatly maps onto Qur’anic Arabic.14\nAs regards the Arabic noun tawbah, it obviously corresponds to tәshuba in rabbinic\nHebrew (BEḲ 39) and Syriac tyābūtā (FVQ 87; see SL 1641). Yet the morphological pat-\ntern faʿlah on which the word tawbah is formed is by no means exceptional in Arabic, as\nshown by examples like ḍarbah, “an act of hitting” (see Wright 1974, 1:110.122–123). Most\nlikely, tawbah is a regular Arabic derivation from the verb tāba, designating literally “an\nact of turning.” One may speculate that among pre- Qur’anic Arabophone consumers of\nBiblical lit er a ture and discourse (i.e., Christians and Jews), tāba and the noun tawbah had\ncome to establish themselves as the Arabic equivalents of Hebrew šāb, Syriac tāb/etpnī,\n12 I am obliged to Alison Salvesen for pointing this out to me.\n13 For other passages from the Hebrew Bible in which divine turning responds to h uman turning, see Joel\n2:13–14 and Jonah 3:9–10.\n14 For another case of etpnī ʿal, see the Peshitta on Zech 1:16, but h ere the Hebrew text itself has ʿal (according\nto HALOT 1430, šāb el and šāb ʿal are equivalent in Hebrew, as evidenced by 2 Chr 30:9).\ntāba 165", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The word tawrāh, archaically spelled هىروت,1 is\nobviously descended from Hebrew tôrâ. It appears exclusively in Medinan verses (JPND\n193–194; KU 70–71; FVQ 95–96), like references to the → injīl or “Gospel.” The most\ninformative Qur’anic characterisation of the tawrāh’s function and content is found in\nQ 5:43–45. Verse 43 declares, inter alia, that the tawrāh contains “God’s judgement” (fīhā\nḥukmu llāhi). This is further elucidated in v. 44: God “sent down” the tawrāh, which con-\ntains “guidance and light” (cf. v. 46, where the same qualification is applied to the Gospel)\nand “by which” (bihi) the “prophets” (al- nabiyyūn) who had “surrendered themselves” to\nGod “judged” (yaḥkumu) the Jews, as did the “rabbis” (al- rabbāniyyūn) and the “scholars”\n(al-a ḥbār; on this term and the preceding one, see u nder → al-y ahūd), “by that part of\nGod’s scripture (→ kitāb) with which they had been entrusted and to which they w ere wit-\nnesses.”2 Although the verse is grammatically complex, it pre sents the tawrāh primarily as\nthe basis for adjudication, a function that v. 47 extends to the “Gospel,” thereby suggesting\na considerable functional similarity between the tawrāh and the injīl.\nThis adjudicatory role of the tawrāh is further accentuated by the fact that Q 5:45 ofers\nan explicit quotation from it. In the tawrāh, the divine voice declares, “we have imposed\nupon them: a life for a life (anna l- nafsa bi- l- nafsi), an eye for an eye, a nose for a nose,\nan ear for an ear, a tooth for a tooth, and wounds entail retaliation (wa- l- jurūḥa qiṣāṣun);\nbut if someone foregoes it as an act of charity (fa- man taṣaddaqa bihi), it will be an act of\natonement (→ kaffārah) for him.” This amounts to a reasonably accurate restatement of\nthe Biblical princip le of talion (Exod 21:24–25; Lev 24:19–20; Deut 19:21), with an added\nflourish recommending clemency that could either be intended to belong to the preceding\nquotation or, alternatively, to be a Qur’anic supplement. The quotation is followed by a\nconcluding appeal to “judge by what God has sent down” that parallels the end of vv. 44\nand 47 (wa- man lam yaḥkum bi- mā anzala llāhu fa- ulāʾika hum . . .).

Sanh.\n4:5; see WMJA 102–103, KU 71, and BEQ 459). Unlike v. 45, this earlier passage does not\nreference the source document from which the quotation in question is supposed to be\ntaken. Given that the Qur’an does not explic itly mention any rabbinic works, such as the\nMishnah or the Talmud—in contrast to Qur’anic allusions to the Torah or the “Gospel”\n(injīl)— this opens up the possibility that at least aspects of the way in which Biblical law\nwas elaborated and interpreted in post-B iblical rabbinic tradition and lit er a ture are h ere\nretrojected onto the Torah itself (cf. BEḲ 65), the proper role of the “rabbis” and “scholars”\nbeing confined to applying the Torah.3\nOverall, Q 5:43–45 pre sents the tawrāh as a revelatory corpus that is based on the ce-\nlestial scripture (→ kitāb) and lends itself to quasi-l egal application, a use that was initially\noverseen by the Israelite prophets and then by the scholars who succeeded them. In keeping\nwith Biblical salvation history, the Qur’an accordingly assumes the opposite of the modern\ncritical slogan lex post prophetas (approximately, “pentateuchal law is l ater than the Bible’s\nliterary prophets”). This understanding of the tawrāh’s adjudicatory role is also reflected\nlater on in Surah 5, when the “scripture- owners” are urged to “observe (aqāma) the tawrāh\nand the injīl” (Q 5:66.68). A final point to note about Q 5:43–45 is the connection between\nthe Torah and the Jews (see the reference to alladhīna hādū in 5:41.44). This illustrates\nthat the Qur’an seems to assume that the tawrāh is the scripture of the Jews in par tic ul ar\nrather than also constituting part of the Christian canon (see u nder → injīl).\nFurther references to the tawrāh outside Surah 5. The explicit coupling of “the\ntawrāh and the injīl” seen in Q 5:66.68 is encountered in other passages as well, such as\nQ 3:3, declaring that God has “sent down the tawrāh and the injīl” (for further references,\nsee under → injīl). Both the tawrāh and the injīl, it is claimed, foretell the appearance of\nMuhammad (Q 7:157) and promise eschatological reward in return for fighting on God’s\npath (Q 9:111), and both contain descriptions, albeit variant ones, of the mettle of Mu-\nhammad’s followers (Q 48:29; see in more detail under → injīl). As far as statements that\nare specific to the tawrāh are concerned, Q 3:50 may be read as implying that the tawrāh\nincludes some prohibitions that were subsequently abolished by Jesus. Some Jewish di-\netary prohibitions, however, are apparently considered to lack any support in the Torah\nat all. Thus, Q 3:93 reports that “all food was permitted to the Israelites, except what Israel\nprohibited to himself (illā mā ḥarrama isrāʾīlu ʿalā nafsihi), before the Torah was sent\ndown” (see also u nder → isrāʾīl and → ḥarrama). The verse continues by challenging the\naddressees— presumably the Jews or Israelites—to “bringp the tawrāh and recite it, if you\nspeak the truth,” which is best understood as a gauntlet thrown down to cont emporary\nJews to demonstrate that certain unspecified food taboos do in fact rest on scriptural\nsupport rather than being human constructs. The following verse, Q 3:94, utters a threat\nagainst those who would “fabricate lies against God,” that is, who falsely pretend that\ncertain non- scriptural prohibitions are based on divine revelation.\nFi nally, Q 62:5 develops a similitude (→ mathal) attacking the cont emporary bearers\nof the Torah: “A similitude for those who have been made to carry the tawrāh and then\n3 But note the observation in Pregill 2021, 188: “It may at first appear that t here is some confusion between the\ncanonical Bible and the Mishnah here, but in Late Antiquity, rabbinic Jews would have considered the Mishnah\ngenuine revelation, communicated orally rather than in writing as the canonical scriptures w ere.”\nal- tawrāh 167", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In the fashion of Christian anti- Jewish polemics, the Qur’an’s\nJewish interlocutors are here charged with possessing a revealed scripture yet failing to\ncomprehend and live up to it. The image of the burden- carrying donkey is one that is also\npre sent in rabbinic discourse, although with a positive significance (WMJA 90; BEQ 441;\nMazuz 2016, 295). Thus, b. ʿAbod. Zar. 5b states: “One should always apply oneself to the\nwords of the Torah like an ox to a yoke and a donkey to a burden.” The Qur’anic mathal\npointedly subverts the original sense of this comparison, thereby turning an ele ment of\nJewish tradition against its bearers, a technique also found elsewhere in the Qur’an (see\nunder → samiʿa). The passage conveys a sense of the polemical energy that was necessary\nin order to elevate Muhammad’s prophetic status over the religious prestige accruing to\nthe Jews by virtue of their possession of, and exegetical expertise in, the tawrāh.\nIs the tawrāh identical with the Pentateuch? In line with an argument made in the\nentry on → injīl, it would not be indefensible to contemplate rendering al- tawrāh simply\nas “Jewish scripture” and al- injīl as “Christian scripture.” Nonetheless, the conventional\ntranslation of tawrāh as “Torah” is prob ably too entrenched and too etymologically com-\npelling in order to brook revision. But even if one chooses to translate tawrāh as “Torah,”\none must certainly not make the automatic inference that the tawrāh can without further\nado be identified with the Pentateuch (Goudarzi 2018, 219–225). The Qur’an repeatedly\nsays that God “gave Moses the scripture” (Q 2:53.87, 6:154, 11:110, 17:2, 23:49, 25:35, 28:43,\n32:23, 41:45: ātaynā mūsā l- kitāba) and mentions “the scripture of Moses” (kitāb mūsā;\nQ 11:17, 46:12) or “the scripture brought by Moses” (Q 6:91: al- kitāb alladhī jāʾa bihi mūsā).\nYet it is never unequivocally stated that Moses received the tawrāh in par tic ul ar. This obser-\nvation leads Mohsen Goudarzi to suggest “that at least in some passages al- tawrāh may\nrefer to the entirety of Israelite prophetic teachings” (Goudarzi 2018, 224), in line with\nHirschfeld’s suggestion that the Qur’anic concept of the tawrāh includes the Mishnah and\nthe Talmud (BEḲ 65).\nThe Qur’an does, however, in two places mention the “scripture of Moses” (kitāb mūsā;\nsee Q 11:17 and 46:12), and one of these goes on to refer to the Qur’an as a “confirming\nscripture” (Q 46:12: wa- hādhā kitābun muṣaddiqun), resembling the affirmation in Q 3:3\nthat the scripture revealed to Muhammad “confirms” the Torah and the Gospel. A third\npassage, Q 6:91, evokes “the scripture brought by Moses as light and guidance (nūran wa-\nhudan) for the people,” thus overlapping with Q 5:44, according to which the Torah con-\ntained “guidance and light” (see also 5:46, saying the same about the Gospel). Q 6:92 then\ncontinues, like 46:12, by insisting that “this” is a “scripture” that “confirms what precedes\nit” (muṣaddiqu lladhī bayna yadayhi). There is at least circumstantial evidence, therefore,\nthat the “scripture of Moses” and the tawrāh are one and the same entity. This does not,\nof course, show that the understanding of the tawrāh’s content that can be gleaned from\nthe Qur’an faithfully agrees with the transmitted text of the Pentateuch. Most likely, the\nQur’anic understanding of what is in the Torah reflects the fact that many if not most of\nMuhammad’s addressees would have derived their notions about Jewish and Christian\nscripture from oral tradition rather than close textual study.\n168 al- tawrāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In the\nformer verse, the divine voice reminds the Messenger that “we gave youS seven mathānī\n(sabʿan mina l-m athānī) and the mighty recitation (wa- l- qurʾāna l-ʿ aẓīm),” while Q 39:23\nstates that “God has sent down the best discourse, a scripture whose mathānī resemble\none another (kitāban mutashābihan mathāniya), which makes the skins of t hose who are\nafraid of their Lord shiver, upon which their skins and their hearts soften to God’s remind-\ning exhortation (dhikr).”1 It is unclear from the Qur’an itself what exactly the singular of\nmathānī might look like. Q 4:3, 34:46, and 35:1 employ the distributive adjective mathnā,\n“in twos” or “in pairs” (Wright 1974, 1:262–263; Burge 2008, 58), though, and g oing by\nthe usual morphology of Arabic one might expect the singular of a broken plural of the\npattern mafāʿil to conform to the noun pattern mafʿal (i.e., mathnā).\nThe importance of excavating the putative meaning of the term mathānī stems largely\nfrom the fact that parts of the Islamic exegetical tradition understand Q 15:87 to refer to\nthe Qur’an’s opening surah, the brief communal prayer known as the Fātiḥah (e.g., Ṭab.\n1 Th ere are several possibilities of analysing the grammar of the Arabic phrase allāhu nazzala aḥsana l-ḥ adīthi\nkitāban mutashābihan mathāniya, on which see Zam. 5:300.

By way of rationalising this reading of the expression “seven\nmathānī,” it is observed that the verses of the Fātiḥah are “repeated” (tuthannā) in the\ncanonical prayer ritual (e.g., Ṭab. 1:107; Zam. 1:99; Ibn Kathīr 1999, 1:102), such that they\nare appropriately described as mathānī, meaning something like “verses to be frequently\nrepeated.”2 If this understanding of Q 15:87 is correct, it entails that the Fātiḥah—w hich is\nnot safely datable by the stylistic par am e ter of mean verse length (HCI 131)—h as a terminus\nante quem at a fairly early point in the Meccan period. In addition, interpreting Q 15:87 to\nallude to Surah 1 has the impor tant consequence of making the Fātiḥah the only Qur’anic\nsurah that is explic itly referenced as a whole—as it w ere, by name—w ithin the Qur’an itself.3\nQ 15:87’s distinction between the seven mathānī and “the mighty qurʾān” would, moreover,\nmanifest a captivating awareness that the Fātiḥah stands apart from the revelatory addresses\nthat make up the bulk of the Qur’anic corpus, perhaps by virtue of being a collective prayer\nformulated in the voice of the Qur’anic community. Against the background of t hese larger\nstakes, the following w ill, with some caveats, argue that the “seven mathānī” are best in-\nterpreted as “a handful of utterances-t o-b e- repeated,” and advocate Theodor Nöldeke and\nAngelika Neuwirth’s view that Q 15:87 does indeed form an inner- Qur’anic reference to the\nFātiḥah. I begin with a detailed survey of e arlier views.\nThe meaning of mathānī in previous scholarship. The Fātiḥah is not the only candidate\nproposed as the referent of the seven mathānī (see, e.g., Ṭab. 14:107–126; for a comprehen-\nsive overview, refer to Rubin 1993). One alternative suggestion is that the seven mathānī are\nthe Qur’an’s seven longest surahs (al- sabʿ al-ṭ uwal/al-ṭ iwāl). Yet given that Surah 15 must\nbe chronologically earlier than any of the long surahs, most of which are Medinan, this al-\nternative view is dismissed as anachronistic already by a voice in the medieval commentary\ntradition.4 By contrast, equating the seven mathānī with the Fātiḥah does not give rise to\nsimilar anachronism. The question of the precise purport of the enigmatic term mathānī is,\nhowever, further complicated by the second occurrence of the mathānī in Q 39:23. Here,\nmany premodern Muslim exegetes are inclined to construe the word as a descriptor or\nappellation pertaining to the Qur’an as a w hole. According to al- Zamaksharī’s commentary\non Q 39:23, mathānī is the plural of a singular mathnā that refers to something “reiterated”\nor “repeated” (muraddad, mukarrar; Zam. 5:300).5 Al- Zamaksharī goes on to explain that\nthe term may e ither connote the Qur’an’s thematic and phraseological repetitiveness or\nthe frequent reiteration of Qur’anic verses in recitation.6\n2 This is not the only etymologisation of the word mathānī found in Islamic commentaries; for alternatives,\nsee Rubin 1993.\n3 However, inner- Qur’anic allusions and back- references are found in many other instances as well (Sinai\n2018b, 265–288; HCI 150–153).\n4 See the objection ascribed to one Abū l-ʿ Āliyah in Ṭab. 14:116 (and mentioned in Rubin 1993, 144): “This\n[verse, namely, Q 15:87] was sent down when nothing of the seven long surahs had yet come down” (la-q ad\nunzilat hādhihī wa- mā nazala mina l-ṭ uwali shayʾ).\n5 The word’s singular is also conjectured to be mathnāh (al- Azharī [1964–1976], 15:138).\n6 To quote, he proposes that the use of the term mathānī is “due to what is repeated of its [= the Qur’an’s]\nnarratives and tidings and judgements and commandments and prohibitions and [eschatological] promises and\nthreats and admonishments” (li- mā thuniyyā min qiṣaṣihi wa- anbāʾihi wa- aḥkāmihi wa- awāmirihi wa- nawāhīhi\nwa- waʿdihi wa- waʿīdihi wa- mawāʿiẓihi). This is followed by the alternative view that the word mathānī indicates\nthe Qur’an’s constant repetition in recitation.\n170 mathānī", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The main\ndifficulty adduced against the traditional position is that it is by no means evident that\nthe text of the Fātiḥah comprises exactly seven verses: if the basmalah, the introductory\ninvocation “In the name of God, the truly Merciful” (→ ˻bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm), is\nnot considered to be part of the surah, the text is more convincingly seen to encompass six\nrather than seven verses (GQ 1:115–116; see also Spitaler 1935, 31). Many Western students\nof the Qur’an have therefore preferred to consider the “seven mathānī” to denote the\nnarratives about previous messengers and the punishments inflicted on their unbelieving\nopponents that are a standard component of a considerable number of Meccan surahs\n(Sprenger 1869, 1:462–464; Müller 1896, 46–47, n. 2; Grimme 1895, 77; KU 26–27; Watt\n1970, 134–135; KK 279–280). This proposal is bolstered by the observation that there is\na core of approximately seven main punishment narratives, figuring, for instance, in the\nnarrative cycles at the centre of Surahs 7, 11, and 26 (JPND 194).7 Since these narratives\nrecur in more than one surah, they could reasonably be designated as mathānī, in the sense\nof narratives that are reprised and repeated, in both Q 15:87 and 39:23. The traditional\nassumption that the Qur’anic term mathānī carries a connotation of repetition or reitera-\ntion is thus retained, even if Western scholars since Abraham Geiger have also proposed\nthat the word’s ultimate etymological origin goes back to Hebrew mishnah or its Aramaic\nequivalent matnita (WMJA 57–58; Nöldeke 1910, 26; FVQ 257–258).8\nYet t here are prob lems with this view, too. Construing the seven mathānī as the Qur’anic\npunishment narratives invites the objection that the sum total of such narratives that are\nrelated in vario us surahs is higher than seven. A champion of the punishment- narrative\nposition will accordingly find it necessary to limit the expression’s reference in Q 15:87 to\na group of principal Qur’anic punishment narratives, as opposed to more peripheral ones.\nThis is not impossible, of course, but the defence does seem somewhat ad hoc. A further\ndifficulty arises from the fact that to many readers Q 15:87 would appear to conceive of\nthe seven mathānī and “the mighty qurʾān” as two separate entities, in so far as the two\nphrases are joined by the conjunction “and” (wa- ) rather than standing in apposition. Such\na two- entity construal of Q 15:87 is not easily squared with the proposal that the seven\nmathānī refer to something that forms part and parcel of many Qur’anic recitations, namely,\nnarratives about past messengers and their audience. Bell and Watt attempt to counter\nthis objection by conjecturing that the punishment narratives might originally have had a\n“separate existence” (Watt 1970, 135), but this presupposes Bell’s highly speculative views\nabout the redactional pre- history of Qur’anic surahs.\nOne might, of course, opt to grasp the nettle and contend that “seven mathānī and the\nmighty qurʾān” simply designate one and the same t hing. Such a one- entity approach to\n7 As Horovitz notes, in all three surahs these seven narratives centre on the figures of Moses, Abraham,\nNoah, Hūd, Ṣāliḥ, Lot, and Shuʿayb (although the order difers).\n8 Quite obviously, the word mathānī in Q 15:87 and 39:23, what ever its purport, does not refer to the Jewish\nMishnah. Yet a semantic realignment of a word whose ultimate origin is non-A rabic in keeping with its assumed\nArabic consonantal root can be witnessed elsewhere in the Qur’an, too; see, for instance, under → al-ṭ āghūt.\nThus, the claim that the word mathānī is ultimately derived from mishnah/matnita is perfectly compatible with\nthe idea that already the Qur’an’s initial audience, rather than just its later exegetes, could have understood the\nword in light of the Arabic root th- n- y.\nmathānī 171", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The main question then becomes what Q 15:87 might mean by calling the Qur’an not\njust “the mathānī” but rather, to translate very literally, “seven of the mathānī” (sabʿan mina\nl- mathānī). Rubin denies that this should be taken to imply that there are other mathānī\nbesides the seven here named, taking the min to be a clarifying min (li-l -b ayān) rather\nthan a partitive one (li- l- tabʿīḍ); and he understands the number seven to be a “symbol of\nmultitude and abundance,” such that the purport of the phrase “seven mathānī” is merely\n“plenty” of mathānī (Rubin 1993, 150). While Rubin does not make it clear what kind of\nentity the (non-a ttested) singular of the term mathānī might signify, he does maintain that\nthe word connotes the phraseologically and thematically “repetitive” nature of Muham-\nmad’s proclamations. One may accordingly paraphrase his understanding of the phrase\n“seven mathānī” as equating to “plenty of repetitive revelations” or the like.\nNöldeke and Neuwirth on the seven mathānī. Two dissenting voices rejecting the\npredominant Western view that the mathānī are the Qur’anic punishment narratives are\nNöldeke and Neuwirth, both of whom champion the traditional identification of the seven\nmathānī from Q 15:87 with the Fātiḥah (Nöldeke 1860, 87–88; NB 26; SPMC 173–175). A\nstrong argument in favour of this position is that it is easy to see how the Fātiḥah, form-\ning as it does a communal prayer to be uttered by the Qur’anic community rather than a\nrevelatory divine address directed at the Qur’anic community, might be juxtaposed with\n“the mighty qurʾān,” meaning t hose revelatory addresses that Muhammad had proclaimed\nprior to Surah 15. To the objection that the Fātiḥah very likely contains not seven but only\nsix verses, Neuwirth replies that Q 15:87 does not necessarily deploy the number seven\nwith a precise numerical valence, just as one might loosely refer to a set of eleven or thir-\nteen items as a dozen. The general symbolic significance of the number seven both in the\nQur’an and in its wider Near Eastern cultural context (Conrad 1988; see also Rubin 1993,\n150–151) makes this rejoinder quite compelling. Accordingly, the semantic force of the\nphrase “seven mathānī” may simply be “a handful of mathānī.” This makes it immaterial\nwhether the Fātiḥah can be analysed to yield exactly seven verses.\nArguably somewhat less felicitously, Neuwirth combines Nöldeke’s traditional under-\nstanding of Q 15:87 with the view that the second Qur’anic occurrence of the term mathānī\nin Q 39:23 does nonetheless refer to the punishment narratives, which she maintains co-\nheres best with the emotional impact with which this latter verse credits the mathānī\n(SPMC 174).9 The upshot of this hybrid position is that she ends up ascribing two rather\ndif er ent meanings to one and the same term, namely, “verses to be liturgically repeated\nin prayer” in Q 15:87 and “narratives repeated in dif er ent Qur’anic surahs” in Q 39:23. It\nis true that Q 15:87 is likely to be significantly e arlier than Q 39:23, which would allow for\nsome semantic development between the two occurrences.10 Nonetheless, one may feel\nthat at least in the absence of incontrovertible evidence to the contrary a unitary account\nof the meaning of the word mathānī is preferable.

It is appropriate to commence by asking w hether the two enti-\nties that God, according to Q 15:87, has given the Qur’anic Messenger— namely, “seven\nmathānī” and “the mighty qurʾān”— must necessarily be interpreted as both being of a\ntextual nature. After all, it would be conceivable that the first of the two gifts mentioned\nin Q 15:87 is to be understood along the lines of the statement in Q 108:1 that the Qur’an’s\ndivine speaker has given the Messenger an “abundance” of unspecified benefactions (innā\naʿṭaynāka l- kawthar).11 Perhaps following a similar line of reasoning, Paul Casanova under-\nstands Q 15:87 to mean that God has given the Qur’anic Messenger “seven benefactions and\nthe glorious Qur’an” (Casanova 1911–1924, 1:37), a translation that he justifies by alluding\nto the fourth-f orm verb athnā ʿalā, “to praise s.o.” Casanova’s proposal, to be sure, re spects\nwhat to many would seem the most straightforward understanding of Q 15:87, namely,\nthat the verse names two separate entities. But it does require the word mathānī to have\nunder gone a major semantic leap between Q 15:87 and 39:23, since the latter passage uses it\nas a descriptor for the scripture communicated to Muhammad and accordingly associates\nit with a textual phenomenon rather than employing it with the non- textual meaning of\nbenefactions. Nor does the link with the fourth-f orm verb athnā ʿalā seem very convincing.\nAgainst Casanova, there is good reason for retaining the assumption that the mathānī are\nindeed something textual. Of course, this still leaves open w hether the mathānī constitute\nunits of texts or rather something contained in texts, such as recurrent narratives.\nIs there any way of further narrowing down the range of viable interpretations of the\nseven mathānī? It is tempting to try to do so by relying on one’s instincts about whether\nQ 15:87 enumerates two separate entities, which Nöldeke considers to be axiomatic (NB\n26), or whether the verse may conceivably be making use of two alternative designations\nfor one and the same thing: if it were the case that the most natu ral interpretation of\nQ 15:87 is indeed a two- entity reading, then it would be relatively easy to eliminate the\nhypothesis that the mathānī are narratives reprised in more than one surah and also Rubin’s\nproposal that the expression “seven of the mathānī” is equivalent with “plenty of repetitive\nrevelations” (in the sense of an alternative appellation for the Qur’anic revelations in their\n11 For extra- Qur’anic evidence of the use of kawthar in early Arabic, see GQ 1:92 and Ullmann 1970, 66.\nIn my view, this material demonstrates that there is nothing especially problematic about the word kawthar\nother than its relative rarity, and thereby obviates any need to speculate, with Luxenberg, that kawthar derives\nfrom a Syriac word (kūttārā) said to mean “per sis tence, steadfastness” (Luxenberg 2007, 292–297), even if the\ndictionaries suggest that the Syriac term means only the act of “remaining, staying” or a “duration” of time\n(TS 1860; SL 617) rather than designating the virtuous character trait of patience or steadfastness (which in\nSyriac might be expressed by words like sūybārā, msaybrānūtā, msharrәrūtā, or naggīrūt rūḥā). There is in fact\nnothing mysterious about the meaning of Q 108:1–2 in its conventional reading: the Qur’an’s singular addressee\nhas been accorded divine benefits (v. 1) and in response is bidden to show his gratitude to God, by prayer and\nsacrifice (v. 2). The same train of thought, expressed in dif er ent terminology, also underlies Surahs 93 and 94\n(early Meccan like Surah 108) and recurs in later expressions of the view that humans owe God gratitude\n(sh-k -r ) in return for the favour (faḍl) or grace (niʿmah) that he has bestowed upon them (e.g., Q 45:12,46:15;\nsee also under → anʿama).

However, despite the considerable intuitive appeal of a two- object reading of\nQ 15:87, several Qur’anic parallels demonstrate that it cannot in fact be regarded as self-\nevident. Thus, at Q 2:53 the divine voice asserts that “we gave Moses the scripture (→ al-\nkitāb) and salvific divine instruction (→ al-f urqān),” and 21:48 similarly states that “we\ngave Moses and Aaron salvific divine instruction (al- furqān), illumination, and reminding\nexhortation (dhikr; see u nder → dhakkara) for the God-f earing.” It is by no means obvious\nthat the expressions conjoined in the two verses just cited need refer to dif er ent entities:\nfor example, Moses’s reception of “the scripture” in Q 2:53 is very likely the very same\npro cess as his reception of “salvific instruction.” An equivalent consideration applies when\nQ 38:20 reports that God granted David “wisdom and decisive speech” (wa- ātaynāhu\nl- ḥikmata wa- faṣla l- khiṭāb; see u nder → ḥikmah). In general, what is technically called an\n“epexegetic” or “clarifying” use of the conjunction wa- (al-ʿ aṭf al- tafsīrī) is well attested\nin the Qur’anic corpus (Hussain 2022b, 129; see also Reckendorf 1921, 324, with some\nnon- Qur’anic examples). Consequently, one cannot hope to narrow down the available\noptions for the meaning of the word mathānī by appealing to intuitions about whether\nQ 15:87 is to be given a one- entity construal or a two- entity one.\nWhat next, then? As Anne- Sylvie Boisliveau has perspicaciously noted (Boisliveau\n2014, 87), the interpretive prob lem raised by the word mathānī derives from the fact\nthat most other Qur’anic occurrences of the root th-n -y (on which see CDKA 54) are\nnot immediately helpful in elucidating the meaning of the term under consideration.\nSpecifically, many occurrences of the root th-n -y refer to the number two (cf. mathnā\nat Q 4:3 etc., noted above), although one verse, Q 11:5, more interestingly employs the\nimperfect of the first- form verb thanā in the sense of folding something up (namely,\none’s chest, in order to hide from God). But overall, the amount of semantic information\non the root th-n -y and its derivatives that can be extracted from the Qur’an is, like the\nquestion of the precise meaning of the conjunction in Q 15:87, insufficient to answer our\nquestion. This makes it virtually inevitable for interpreters who are not prepared to resign\nthemselves to agnosticism to take their bearings from extra- Qur’anic data, whether that\nbe the Arabic second- form verb thannā, “to repeat,” or a conjectured etymology going\nback to Hebrew mishnah. In short, if we want to arrive at any sort of En glish translation\nfor the Qur’anic word mathānī, we have no choice but to mount the delicate balance\nbeam of speculation.\nIt is encouraging, at least, that t here is no need to view the two pieces of extra- Qur’anic\ninformation just noted—t he potential link with the verb thannā and the conjectural He-\nbrew or Aramaic etymology of mathānī first tabled by Geiger—as pointing in dif er ent\ndirections. Angelika and Karl Neuwirth, in the course of their argument that the seven\nmathānī are identical with the Fātiḥah, compellingly render the Arabic word as Wieder-\nholverse or “verses-t o- be- repeated” (Neuwirth and Neuwirth 1991, 341). Bearing in mind\nthat the scope of the textual units concerned is not obvious, this is preferably modified to\nsomething less specific like “utterances- to- be- repeated” or “dicta- to- be- repeated,” which\nincidentally converges with Nöldeke’s observation that the Qur’anic mathānī are “some-\nthing like ‘dicta’ or even short portions (verses) of revelation” (NB 26). The provisional\ntranslation “utterances- to- be- repeated,” though stylistically awkward, has the advantage\nof matching both the link with Arabic thannā that is posited by Muslim exegetes while\nalso being reconcilable with Geiger’s idea that the plural noun mathānī ultimately derives\nfrom Hebrew mishnah / Aramaic matnita.\n174 mathānī", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:197", "title": "Page 197", "locator": "pdf_page:197", "text": "In order to appreciate this latter point, it is helpful to try to restate Geiger’s etymological\nhypothesis in such a way as to trace a plausible semantic evolution over time, rather than\nimplying that Muhammad arbitrarily dragged a Hebrew word into Arabic while missing\nor wilfully distorting part of its established meaning. Specifically, one may posit, first, that\nArabophone Jews in the Qur’anic environment used a hy po thet ic al singular mathnāh in\norder to render Hebrew mishnah. This sense of the word mathnāh is attested in the ḥadīth,\nwhere the mathnāh is associated with the “scripture- owners” and cited as a warning example\nfor committing to writing anything other than the Qur’an (Goldziher 1907, 865–869; Cook\n1997, 502–504; see also al- Azharī [1964–1976], 15:139). Of course, the reports in question\nonly give us an early post- Qur’anic terminus ante quem for the arrival of the word in Ara-\nbic; Cook, for one, is inclined to place material opposing the writing down of prophetic\ntradition in the early second century of Islam. But the supposition that al- mathnāh = “the\nMishnah” was already coined by pre-I slamic Arabophone Jews fits the fact that Jews in the\nQur’anic milieu clearly employed what Torrey calls “mongrel words, partly Aramaic (or\nHebrew) and partly Arabic” (Torrey 1933, 51). Though Torrey’s formulation is unfashion-\nable, the Arabisation of religious terminology originating from Hebrew or Jewish Aramaic\nis well supported by Qur’anic terms like → ummī (“scriptureless”), → al-t awrāh (“the\nTorah”), kaffārah (“expiation”; → kaffara), minhāj (“custom”; see under → al-y ahūd),\nand the designation of Jewish dignitaries as rabbāniyyūn and aḥbār (see again under → al-\nyahūd).12 As shown elsewhere, the Jews in the Qur’anic milieu were familiar with at least\nsome rabbinic traditions, and in one place (Q 5:32) are quoted as paraphrasing a specific\npassage from the Mishnah (see u nder → al- yahūd); it is reasonable to assume, therefore,\nthat they would have had an Arabic name for the Mishnah, as they did for the Torah. In a\nsecond step, it may be surmised that the conjectured Jewish usage of Arabic mathnāh to\nrender mishnah is what underlies the Qur’anic plural mathānī. This second claim coheres\nwith the fact that Arabic lexicography floats the same word mathnāh as the under lying\nsingular of the Qur’anic mathānī (al- Azharī [1964–1976], 15:138).\nNow, the rabbinic term mishnah/matnita does not just designate the Mishnah as a lit-\nerary document but also its constituent traditions, i.e., individual tannaitic or “Mishnaic”\nstatements (DJBA 722–723), in so far as these are repeated, learnt, and recited or reported.\nThe latter are all pos si ble meanings of the peʿal verb of the root t- n- y in rabbinic Aramaic\n(DJBA 1218–1221) that could easily have mapped on to the Arabic verb thannā. Taking\nanother step on the balance beam of speculation, we may choose to posit that the word\nmathnāh, as hypothetically used by Arabic-s peaking Jews prior to the Qur’an, would have\ndesignated not only the Mishnah as a w hole but also individual Mishnaic traditions that are\nrepeated and recited (cf. Torrey 1933, 51, who based on similar considerations translates\nmathānī as “teachings”). By extension, the word mathnāh could therefore have become\navailable to mean any brief unit of text, or of textual content, that is credited with religious\nauthority and is taught, learnt, and repeated by a community—an activity conceivably\ndesignated by the Arabic verb thannā, cognate with Aramaic tnā.13 The Qur’anic use of\nthe root th- n- y in connection with duality and doubling up would be at least compatible\n12 Despite my general agreement with the phrase cited from Torrey, I am not tempted to follow his sugges-\ntion that the word sabʿ in Q 15:87 is not an Arabic numeral but rather derives from Aramaic sibʿa or śabʿa/śubʿa,\n“plenty” (on which see DTTM 951 and DJBA 1188).\n13 One may add that Syriac tnā, “to repeat,” can also mean “to recite” (TS 4464–4465; SL 1654–1655).\nmathānī 175", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Moreover, it is really only the application of mishnah/matnita to\nthe Mishnah’s constituent traditions that explains the Qur’anic plural mathānī, if indeed\nthe latter is to be etymologically derived from mishnah: “the Mishnah” as a literary work\ndoes not have a plural.\nBased on t hese etymological conjectures, our best guess at the meaning of the plural\nmathānī, then, is that it signifies textual units, or perhaps traditions or narratives, that are\nrepeatedly recited. Factoring in the likely symbolic meaning of the number seven, the seven\nmathānī are therefore “a handful of utterances-t o- be- repeated,” “a handful of dicta-t o- be-\nrepeated,” or “a handful of traditions- to- be- repeated.” To be sure, the interpretive space\nleft by these tentative attempts at translation still encompasses a range of possibilities,\nincluding perhaps the view that the seven mathānī are narrative accounts of the ministry\nof earlier messengers and the destruction of their p eoples. But one won ders why Muham-\nmad’s being granted cautionary accounts of God’s obliteration of past communities should\nwarrant the sort of triumphal and gratitude- inspiring announcement that Q 15:87 is clearly\nmeant to make. Qur’anic narratives about previous messengers can of course have a con-\nsolatory upshot: the wicked are punished, but the righ teous are delivered. Yet if the plural\nmathānī is indeed an Arabisation of mishnah/matnita, in the sense of a tannaitic tradition\nor dictum, one would expect the mathānī to refer to fairly brief units of text rather than\npotentially extended narrative accounts like those found in, say, Surah 26 (which could\nwell be e arlier than Surah 15). With regard to Rubin’s opinion that the seven mathānī are\nan alternative designation of the Qur’anic corpus as a whole, it must be pointed out that\nthe number seven, even if understood as a symbolic number, is nonetheless a relatively low\nnumber in this context. Given its mean verse length, Surah 15 must be one of the latest early\nMeccan surahs (see HCI 161), which means that it may be estimated to have been preceded\nby at least thirty or forty other Qur’anic compositions. Hence, the number seven would\nnot be an appropriate symbol of “multitude and abundance” (Rubin 1993, 150) even if the\nmathānī are understood to be entire surahs. The objection gains in force if, in line with the\netymological considerations above, the plural mathānī is taken to refer to shorter units of\ntexts, such as individual verses or verse groups.\nBy contrast with such latent doubts, Nöldeke and Neuwirth’s neo- traditional iden-\ntification of the “handful of utterances- to- be- repeated” from Q 15:87 with the Fātiḥah\nyields a very plausible contextual fit. For one, the Fātiḥah is in impor tant re spects a text\nthat stands formally apart from most other Qur’anic surahs: although quite a few of them\ncontain human prayers that are embedded in vari ous polemical, narrative, hymnic, or\nother contexts,14 there are only four surahs that are explic itly and entirely formulated in a\nfirst-p erson human voice (Q 1, 109, 113–114); and within this small group the Fātiḥah stands\nout by its employment of the first person plural rather than singular.15 As duly stressed\nby Neuwirth, the Fātiḥah is the Qur’an’s communal prayer par excellence. Meanwhile, the\nsupposed difficulty that the Fātiḥah does not consist of exactly seven verses is convincingly\naddressed by Neuwirth’s rejoinder that the number seven in Q 15:87 is not to be understood\n14 One example for such attributed communal prayer is the request for divine forgiveness and mercy with\nwhich the believers are charged at the end of Sūrat al-B aqarah (Q 2:285–286). For other instances of attributed\ncommunal prayers employing the address “Our Lord (rabbanā),” see Q 2:127–129.200–201.250, 3:7–9.16.53.191–\n194 etc.\n15 There are, however, two brief communal prayers that Islamic sources report to have been included in the\nQur’anic recension of Ubayy ibn Kaʿb, Sūrat al- Khalʿ and Sūrat al- Ḥafd; see Anthony 2019.\n176 mathānī", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This makes it entirely conceivable that an explicit\nawareness of this fact might already be reflected by the Qur’an itself.\n17 Phraseology in Surah 1 that is attested in Meccan surahs (without therefore being necessarily absent\nfrom Medinan ones) includes the reference to “praise” (→ ḥamd) of God and the epithet “Lord of the world-\ndwellers” (rabb al- ʿālamīn; see under → rabb and → al-ʿ ālamūn) in v. 2, the portrayal of God as the “king” (see\nunder → malik) of “judgement day” (yawm al-d īn; → dīn1) in v. 4, the verb istaʿāna, “to turn for help to s.o.”\n(namely, God) in v. 5 (see Q 7:128, 12:18, 21:112), and the reference to divine wrath in v. 7 (→ ghaḍiba).\n18 It should also be noted that the masculine pronoun that connects the description of how “t hose who\nare afraid of their Lord” respond to the Qur’anic proclamations with the beginning of the verse (taqshaʿirru\nminhu . . .) does not directly link back to the word mathānī, which would require a female pronoun, but rather\nto either aḥsana l-ḥ adīthi (“the best discourse”) or to kitāban mutashābihan (“a self-s imilar scripture”).

The jinn are a class of super natural, demon-\nlike spirits who are only mentioned in Meccan surahs. The term jinn is perhaps to be ex-\nplained by the root j- n- n’s connotation of veiling, covering, and concealment (e.g., RAH\n148, DTEK 9–10, and Awn 1983, 30–31; see Q 6:76, where janna ʿalā means “to cover”).1 The\ncollective jinn and the singular jānn would seem to be connected with Classical Ethiopic\ngānen, “demon, evil spirit” (NB 63; see also Leslau 1991, 198),2 but the precise relation-\nship between the Arabic and the Ethiopic words remains unclear, and a recent review of\nthe debate about the etymology of jinn reiterates the view that a derivation from outside\nArabic cannot be proven (Nünlist 2015, 22–26). Like other spirits, the jinn figure in early\nArabic poetry as threatening spectres haunting desolate places (e.g., DSAAP, Ṭarafah,\nno. 3:1, on which see RAH 149–150; for a general digest of how ancient Arabian demons are\nportrayed in mostly Islamic sources, refer to Al- Azmeh 2014, 205–212). The pantheon of\nPalmyra included a class of beings termed gnyʾ, who functioned as tutelary gods and who\nhave been described as resembling both the Arabic jinn and the genii of Roman religion\n(Teixidor 1979, 77–80; Grasso, forthcoming).3\nBased on material first analysed by Goldziher, it is often said that pre-I slamic Arabs\nconsidered poets to be inspired by personal jinnis (Goldziher 1896, 1–44). The evidence\n1 This root meaning is prob ably also operative in Q 53:32, where idh antum ajinnatun fī buṭūni ummahātikum\nmeans “when youp w ere fetuses [hidden] in yourp m others’ wombs.” Cf. AEL 403, according to which janīn refers\nto “anything veiled, concealed, hidden, or covered.”\n2 On jānn as a singular, see CDKA 63 (agreeing with RAH 148 and against the position advanced in DTEK 11).\n3 As Grasso notes, it is unlikely that there is an etymological connection between the words gnyʾ and genius,\nbut their phonetic similarity may well have encouraged a subsequent merger of the concepts.\n180 ijtanaba", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Nonetheless, it is pos si ble to\nmuster at least a few verses in direct support of the idea (EAP 1:223–224), including sev-\neral instances in the poetic corpus of al- Aʿshā Maymūn that refer to the latter’s demonic\ncompanion Misḥal (Ḥusayn 1983, nos 15:43, 20:27, and 33:32–33; see also GMK 170).4 It\nseems, therefore, that at least some pre- Islamic jinn were believed to have a benevolent\nnature. The Palmyran gnyʾ, too, are protective rather than threatening beings, and some of\nthem, such as Abgal and Ashar, are explic itly called “good” (gnyʾ ṭbʾ; see Grasso, forthcom-\ning, and Teixidor 1979, 80–84). Perhaps taking such ambient notions of benevolent and\nprotective spirits a step further, the Qur’an (and particularly Q 72, conventionally called\nSūrat al- Jinn) distinguishes between malicious jinn, on the one hand, and righ teous and\nbelieving jinn, on the other. As we s hall see below, this forms a notable contrast with the\npredominantly negative understanding of demons in late antique Chris tian ity.5\nFrom a terminological perspective, it is impor tant to observe that the Qur’an sometimes\nuses the term jinn interchangeably with al- shayāṭīn, “the dev ils” (cf., e.g., Q 72:8–9 with\n15:17–18 and 37:7–10). As argued elsewhere in this dictionary, this is best explained by\npositing that “the dev ils” are a subclass of the jinn, namely, those jinn who are malicious\n(→ shayṭān). Qur’anic narratives about the creation and fall of Adam foreground one par-\ntic u lar member of the jinn, Iblīs or Satan / “the devil” (→ al- shayṭān), humankind’s sworn\nenemy and tempter. Unlike the jinn as a collective, he continues to appear in Medinan texts\nand is discussed in an in de pen dent entry.\nThe nature and character of the jinn in comparison to h umans. Throughout the Mec-\ncan surahs, “h umans and jinn” (al- ins wa- l- jinn) are frequently paired to designate the to-\ntality of subcelestial (i.e., non- divine and non-a ngelic) rational agents (e.g., Q 6:112.130,\n7:38.179, 17:88, 27:17, 55:33, 72:5; 11:119, 32:13, and 114:6 have al-j innah wa-l -n ās, while\n55:39.56.74 combine the collective ins with the singular jānn, clearly in order to meet the\nsurah’s prevalent rhyme in -ā n). This formulaic coupling of h umans and the jinn has parallels\nin early poetry (e.g., Ḥusayn 1983, no. 33:33, and EAP 1:179).6 At least as far as the Qur’an\nis concerned, the pairing of h umans and the jinn is indicative of impor tant similarities be-\ntween the two groups: the jinn share with humankind the fact that God created them for\n4 That Misḥal is a jinni becomes clear from Ḥusayn 1983, no. 33:33. Jones also cites Lyall 1918–1924,\nno. 40:100.104–107 (where the genius of an opposing poet is called “his shayṭān”). Although the author is said\nto have lived into the second half of the first Islamic c entury, Goldziher’s view that early Islamic allusions to in-\nspirational demons are a survival from the pre- Islamic period remains the most plausible account of the origin of\nthe notion. This is not to rule out that the diction of the passage just referenced— especially the author’s reference\nto his opponent’s shayṭān (v. 100)— might be influenced by Q 26:221–226, which refers to the descending of the\nshayāṭīn or “dev ils” on liars and sinners and then accuses poets of “saying what they do not do” (see also below\nin the main text). But it does not look likely that all poetic allusions to inspirational demons are merely echoes\nand amplifications of Q 26:221–226.\n5 Guillaume Dye hints at a very dif er ent understanding of the Qur’anic jinn when he speaks of their “dia-\nbolisation” in the Qur’an, in line with Christian demonology, although he duly notes the existence of passages\ncasting the jinn in a more positive light, such as Q 46:29 f. and Surah 72 (Dye 2019, 781). However, the book\nchapter in which Dye develops his position (see Dye 2019, 780, n. 1) does not yet seem to be out.\n6 The latter occurrence is in the Lāmiyyat al- ʿarab attributed to al- Shanfarā. On the contested question of\nthis poem’s authenticity, see, e.g., EAP 1:139–140 (in favour of authenticity) and el Masri 2020, 24 (conceding\ninauthenticity but nonetheless holding that the poem is a non- anachronistic “replica” of pre- Islamic poetic\nlanguage and themes).

Moreover, h umans and jinn are both divided into “commu-\nnities” or “p eople” (singular: → ummah; Q 7:38, 41:25). Impor tant diferences between the\ntwo species are however recognised: while h umans w ere created from clay (Q 15:26, 23:12,\n32:7, 55:14), the jinn w ere created from fire (Q 15:27, 55:15).8 It is perhaps this diference in\nmaterial constitution that explains the jinn’s possession of certain extraordinary abilities\n(DTEK 36), such as, presumably, invisibility and not being earthbound (e.g., Q 72:8). Two\nQur’anic verses describing the snake into which Moses’s rod was miraculously transformed\nas “wriggling like a jinni” (Q 27:10, 28:31: tahtazzu ka- annahā jānnun) may intimate an\naffinity between the jinn and reptiles (see also under → shayṭān). However, the point of\ncomparison could also be a par tic ul ar rapidity and suddenness of movement.9\nAlthough the Qur’an credits the jinn with at least some superhuman powers, they\nnonetheless do not occupy a fundamentally dif er ent position in the Qur’anic world- view\nthan h umans. For one, the jinn do not have knowledge of future events (Q 72:10) or of “the\nhidden” (→ al- ghayb; Q 34:14), and when a wicked jinni or → shayṭān attempts to eaves-\ndrop on what is being said in God’s celestial council or “the assembly on high” (→ ˻al- malaʾ\nal- aʿlā), he is chased away with a shooting star (Q 15:16–18, 37:6–10, 67:5, 72:8–9; see also\n26:210–212.223, discussed in more detail below, and generally Hawting 2006). Moreover,\nthe jinn are bidden not to utter falsehoods about God (Q 72:5), and according to one verse\nhave even been sent their own messengers (Q 6:130; see the discussion in DTEK 35). Like\nhumans, the jinn will face eschatological judgement (Q 6:128, 37:158, 55:39), as a result\nof which they may sufer eternal perdition (Q 7:38.179, 11:119, 32:13, 72:15). Some jinn, on\nthe other hand, are said to have “listened to” and “believed in” the Qur’anic revelations,\ninspiring them to return to their people as “warners” (Q 46:29–32). Consequently, some\njinn qualify as right eous (Q 72:11: minnā l-ṣ āliḥūna) and as surrendering themselves to God\n(Q 72:14: minnā l-m uslimūna; → aslama). It seems significant that the Qur’an employs\nthe verbs → samiʿa, istamaʿa, and other derivatives of the root s- m-ʿ in order to refer both\nto some jinn’s listening to, and heeding of, the Qur’anic proclamations (Q 46:29.30 and\n72:1.13) as well as to the illicit and inevitably unsuccessful attempts of other jinn to overhear\nthe deliberations of the divine council (Q 15:18, 26:212, 37:8, 72:9). Just like h umans, the jinn\nare expected to recognise their epistemic limitations and to accept the divine revelations\nthat alone convey some mea sure of insight into “the hidden.” Overall, the Qur’anic jinn may\nappropriately be characterised as “doubles” or “doppelgangers” of humankind (DTEK 36).\nThe jinn, in other words, function as a potent mirror image held up to the Qur’an’s human\naddressees: despite being superhumanly power ful creatures who have been fashioned from\n7 That the jinn w ere created by God is also concisely mentioned in Q 6:100, though without any indication\nof the ultimate purpose of the act.\n8 Q 15:27 does not just say that the jinn were created from fire but min nāri l- samūm. Since al-s amūm is\nsaid by lexicographers to mean a scorching wind (AEL 1420), Chabbi argues that Q 15:27 envisages the jinn\nto consist of scorching air (air brûlant) rather than fire properly speaking (Chabbi 2020, 190–194). However,\nthe two other Qur’anic instances of samūm both occur in references to punishment in hell (Q 52:27: ʿadhāb al-\nsamūm; 56:42: fī samūmin wa- ḥamīm). This strongly suggests that the word means “blaze” in the Qur’an and\nthat Chabbi’s view is mistaken.\n9 That the rod was transformed into a snake is reported in Q 7:107 and 26:32 (fa- alqā ʿaṣāhu fa- idhā hiya\nthuʿbānun mubīn) as well as 20:20 (fa- alqāhā fa- idhā hiya ḥayyatun tasʿā).\n182 jinn, jinnah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Late antique Jews and\nChristians, like the Qur’an, considered demons to be part of the world created by God and\neven to have been created directly by him (e.g., Gen. Rab. 7:5). As shown by literary texts\nbut also by incantation bowls and amulets, Christians and Jews saw demons as a source of\naffliction, possession, and temptation who needed to be repelled and exorcised (see, e.g.,\nBohak 2017; Lunn-R ocklife 2018a and 2018b). It is true that spirits could become power ful\nallies if conjured and harnessed, and the rabbinic tradition can depict demons as neutral\nor even benevolent (Bohak 2017, 122–123; Ronis 2018). The Neoplatonist Porphyry went\nso far as to recognise the existence of morally good demons (Lunn- Rocklife 2018a, 499).\nBut at least to Christians, demons very much tended to be inherently malicious (Muehl-\nberger 2013, 30): “for many early Christians, the three classes of rational beings”—h umans,\nangels, and demons— “ were not just ontologically dif er ent, variant in their natures, but\nalso morally dif er ent. Human beings w ere morally ambivalent, angels good, and demons\nevil.”10 How did Jews and Christians reconcile the existence of evil spirits with the creator’s\naxiomatic goodness? Among the dif er ent etiologies put forward were the following two\norigin stories: demons are the ofspring of angels who had lustfully mated with h uman\nfemales in the run-up to the Biblical deluge; or demons are spirits who had fallen from\nGod’s presence together with the devil, when the latter refused to prostrate himself to the\nnewly created Adam (e.g., Lunn-R ocklife 2018a, 497–498, and Lunn-R ocklife 2018b, 278;\nsee also under → shayṭān).11\nAgainst this general background, the Qur’anic insistence that the jinn are subject to\nthe same religious norms and other-w orldly rewards and punishments as h umans and that\nat least some jinn are genuine believers stands out. The New Testament does report that\ndemons exorcised or about to be exorcised by Jesus recognised him as the Son of God or\nthe like (see Mark 1:24 and 3:11, Matt 8:29, or Luke 4:41), and the Epistle of James explic-\nitly refers to believing demons (Jas 2:19): “You believe that God is one; you do well.\nEven the demons believe—a nd shudder.”12 However, in neither case is there a suggestion\nthat the demons in question are meritorious.13 As Ephrem puts it, it was not “in truth” that\nthe demons acknowledged Jesus as the Messiah (Beck 1970a, no. 2:1449–1450), and the\nargument of the passage from the Epistle of James is that “faith apart from works is barren”\n(Jas 2:20); the demons are consequently invoked to exemplify someone who believes in\nGod’s existence and power yet lacks works, and therefore falls short of what is required\n(Barton and Muddiman 2001, 1259). A more pertinent parallel to the Qur’an’s interest\nin demons as moral and religious agents may be the recent insight that the Babylonian\nTalmud occasionally constructs demons as “beings with responsibility and agency who\n10 David Frank furter observes that in the early Jewish tradition demons “oscillated, or had the potential to\noscillate, between beneficial and malevolent functions” (Frank furter 2011, 127) and then argues that a remnant of\n“demonic ambiguity” (Frank furter 2011, 128) is also pre sent in the Christian tradition, despite its general emphasis\non demons as implacable foes (see also Lunn-R ocklife 2018a, 504–505, and Lunn-R ocklife 2018b, 269–270, 285).\n11 For a succinct list of further Jewish etiologies of demons, see Bohak 2017, 128.\n12 I owe this reference to Holger Zellentin.\n13 As Saqib Hussain points out to me, one might compare this to Q 59:16, where Satan, after having success-\nfully tempted a human, disowns his victim and confesses that even he is afraid of (akhāfu) God. This does not\nseem to alter the negative verdict of Satan expressed in other Qur’anic contexts.\njinn, jinnah 183", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Such an assimilation of demonic\nand human agency at least anticipates aspects of Qur’anic demonology.\nDespite the peculiar moralistic inflection of Qur’anic demonology, the Qur’anic jinn are\nundoubtedly continuous with demonological conceptions current in the wider late antique\nworld. One such aspect of continuity is the notion that demons are able to gain knowledge\nof future events by eavesdropping on God’s council. This is paralleled, for example, by\nthe Testament of Solomon, where one demon explains to Solomon that he and his ilk “go\nup to the firmament of heaven, fly around among the stars, and hear the decisions which\nissue from God concerning the lives of men” (Charlesworth 1983, 983 = ch. 20). Even if the\nemergence and final dating of the Testament of Solomon, which exists in more than one re-\ncension, continues to be debated (see Schwarz 2007), the idea at hand is safely regarded as\npre- Qur’anic, seeing that it is also reflected in the Babylonian Talmud. Thus, according to b.\nḤag. 16a, demons have wings like ministering angels, enabling them to fly from one end of\nthe world to the other, and possess knowledge of the f uture since they “listen from b ehind\nthe curtain, like ministering angels.”14 The Qur’an presupposes this idea, but additionally\nholds that demonic attempts to overhear God’s decrees will always fail, since the divine\ncreator has secured the celestial realm against any unauthorised interlopers by chasing\nthe latter away with shooting stars (HCI 89). This is not to say that the view that shooting\nstars serve to dispel demons from the upper reaches of heaven is necessarily a Qur’anic\ncreation, for it appears in two lines of poetry attributed to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt that fit\nthe rhyme and metre of an extended poem about God’s creation of the heavens and the\nearth (Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:27–28, corresponding to al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:27–28): “And\nyou see dev ils turning aside, forced to take refuge (tarūghu muḍāfatan), scattered apart\nwhen they are driven away (idhā mā tuṭradū). // Upon them are cast (tulqā ʿalayhā) dis-\ngrace in heaven and stars (kawākib), by which they are pelted (turmā bihā), causing them\nto flee (fa- tuʿarridū).”15 Incidentally, the inaccessibility of the seventh heaven is also evoked\nin another verse of the same poem (Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:15 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:15),\nthough without explicit reference to the fending of of inquisitive demons.\nOverall, however, the continuities between Qur’anic and late antique demonologies\nare counterbalanced by significant disparities. Late antique Jews and Christians inhabited\n“a world thronged with demons” (Lunn-R ocklife 2018b, 269), a world in which demons\n14 Also relevant is b.

However, Ashmedai comes across as having proper clearance to visit the heavenly realm\nhere rather than as illegitimately snatching up information to which he is not meant to be privy.\n15 This is the couplet referenced, at one remove, in RAH 137, n. 6.

The degree of lexical overlap with relevant Qur’anic parallels is\nlimited to shayāṭīn and kawākib, which makes al- Saṭlī’s assessment that the two verses are “Islamic in meaning”\nat least debatable. My translation follows al- Saṭlī in reading shattā rather than ṣ- b- r as per Schulthess. Al- Saṭlī\nglosses muḍāfatan as meaning “in fear,” while Schulthess translates kopflos. According to the lexica, aḍāfa min\ndoes indeed mean “to fear s.th.” (AEL 1813), but of course the verse has the passive participle rather than the\nactive one. Perhaps aḍāfa is here used in the sense of “to force s.o. to seek recourse or take refuge” (i.e., “to make\ns.o. a ḍayf”; see AEL 1814, where aḍāfahu ilayhi is glossed as “he made him to have recourse to it, or to betake\nhimself to it for refuge”). It may also be that aḍāfa is employed as the causative of ḍāfa, “to turn away from (ʿan)\ns.th.” (in which case muḍāfatan would simply amplify the meaning of rāgha) or as the causative of ḍāfa, “to fear.”\nI am grateful to Tilman Seidensticker for help with this passage.\n184 jinn, jinnah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Bәr. 6a; Bohak 2017, 121; Lunn-R ocklife 2018a, 501; Lunn-\nRocklife 2018b, 274–275; Ronis 2018, 17–19); failure to wash one’s hands before eating or\nurinating between a palm tree and a wall make one vulnerable to demonic assault (Bohak\n2017, 120 and 123–124; see b. Yoma 77b, b. Ḥul. 107b, and b. Pәsaḥ. 111a); and demons may\ncause headache or be called down upon a victim to make him “bellow like a pig” (Bohak\n2017, 116–117 and 118–119). By contrast, the Qur’an does not convey a comparably urgent\nsense that the jinn pose a formidable threat to h umans: the Qur’anic jinn “are neither able\nto harm or benefit h umans; they are fully occupied with looking a fter themselves, for they,\ntoo, are subject to God’s judgement” (DTEK 34). It is quite apt, therefore, to say that the jinn\nhave been “dispossessed” in the Qur’an (Chabbi 2020, 185–211). A dif ere nt way of putting\nthis point would be to say that the Qur’anic cosmos is characterised by a fairly advanced,\nthough certainly not complete, state of disenchantment, meaning a state of being drained of\ndemonic, magical, and suchlike forces that are taken to exist alongside the supreme power\nof the divine creator.16 The principal reason why evil jinn or “dev ils” (al- shayāṭīn) can pose\na danger to the Qur’an’s addressees is b ecause they are sources of moral temptation, by\nswaying them to commit misdeeds that w ill be punished by the divine judge, not b ecause\ndemons are associated with objective forces that might make themselves felt in de pen dently\nof h uman action, such as the power to inflict illness.\nIt is precisely against the background of the jinn’s dispossession that a number of\nQur’anic passages condemn those who would mistake the jinn for beings deserving cultic\nveneration. Thus, Q 6:100 accuses those who have “assigned to God the jinn as associ-\nates (singular: sharīk; → ashraka), even though he has created them” (wa-j aʿalū li-l lāhi\nshurakāʾa l- jinna wa- khalaqahum), and in Q 34:41 the angels defend themselves against\nGod’s question whether they have been objects of human veneration by accusing the\nculprits of having served the jinn instead. Another passage complains that “some h umans\n16 It is true that Surah 113 invokes God’s protection against “the evil of w omen blowing on knots” (Q 113:4);\nthis looks like a magical practice that is meant to be kept in check by God but whose basic efficacy is taken for\ngranted. Other Qur’anic passages that acknowledge magic as a real phenomenon locate it in the past. Thus, the\nQur’an repeatedly recounts Moses’s confrontation with the Egyptian magicians (e.g., Q 7:103–126); here, not\nunlike Surah 113, God, as represented by Moses, overcomes magic, which of course presupposes that the latter\nhas some degree of real ity (cf. Q 7:116). Moreover, as discussed below in the main text, Solomon is reported to\nhave been given control of the jinn and their powers, while Q 2:102 alludes to malevolent demons or dev ils (al-\nshayāṭīn) cont emporary with Solomon who transmitted magical knowledge. Most Qur’anic references to magic,\nhowever, are merely concerned with castigating an alleged h uman penchant for writing of God’s revelations\nand signs as mere magic (e.g., Q 54:2, 74:24). On the Weberian category of “disenchantment” (deployed in the\nmain text) and its problematic polysemy, see Joas 2019, 201–277. In describing the Qur’anic cosmos as being, to\nsome degree, disenchanted, I associate an enchanted world with one that is imbued with spirits, demons, and\n“moral forces,” following Charles Taylor (Taylor 2007, 26, 29–41). Note, though, that elsewhere Taylor links\nthe concept of disenchantment specifically with a “denial of the sacred”— meaning a denial of the distinction\nbetween sacred and profane things, places, and times (Taylor 2007, 77). Disenchantment in this sense is not\nstraightforwardly applicable to the Qur’an, since the latter does expressly recognise certain places and times as\nsacred, even though their sacrality would in most cases seem to be due to divine designation rather than to any\nintrinsic powers or qualities (see under → ḥarrama). As Joas argues, it is imperative to disentangle the vari ous\naspects that tend to be conflated in the category of disenchantment, including a rejection of magic, a rejection\nof the distinction between sacred and profane, and the rejection of a transcendent sphere of real ity. Such an\nanalytic disentanglement helpfully permits one to recognise that the vario us pro cesses in question do not form\nan indivisible package and can be pre sent or absent separately (Joas 2019, 254).\njinn, jinnah 185", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Read along\nthese lines, the verses just examined are insisting that what may appear, from the inside, to\nbe worship of divine beings r eally amounts to worship of demons. A fter all, the Qur’an also\nwarns against venerating “the devil,” → al- shayṭān (Q 19:44, 36:60; see also 4:117), which\nhardly implies the existence of Satanic rituals in pre- Islamic Arabia. Such a demonological\naccount of rituals that w ere deemed idolatrous from a mono thei stic perspective has Biblical\npre ce dent (see 1 Cor 10:20 and Deut 32:17; Hawting 1999, 51).\nEven more enigmatic than the verses just discussed is Q 6:128, where the divine judge\naddresses the jinn by saying that they have “obtained” or “sought to obtain many h umans”\n(qadi stakthartum mina l-i nsi). This could mean that the jinn, or some of them, are engaged\nin actively seducing humans to venerate them (DTEK 16). This would fit with the pre-\nsumption that the beneficiaries of illicit polytheistic worship are likely to be in some sense\ncomplicit in the ritual behaviour of their devotees, a presumption that is also manifested by\nQ 25:17 (see u nder → ashraka). But it may also be that Q 6:128 is merely a generic reference\nto demons as sources of moral temptation. This latter theme is certainly well exemplified\nby passages according to which God assigns malicious demons or “dev ils” (al- shayāṭīn)\nas companions to those humans who have rejected his reminding exhortation (dhikr),\nthereby reinforcing them in their wickedness (e.g., Q 43:36–38; → shayṭān). To reiterate,\nfrom the Qur’anic perspective any danger emanating from the jinn would seem to hinge\non moral temptation rather than physical harm to life, limb, and property or even m ental\npossession. The Qur’anic depiction of the jinn is therefore moralistic in a double sense:\nnot only in so far as the jinn themselves are constructed as moral subjects but also in so\nfar as their impact on human subjects is understood in moral terms.\nSolomon and the jinn. Another obvious point of continuity between the Qur’anic\njinn and earlier demonological conceptions are Qur’anic resonances of the idea, wide-\nspread in late antique thought, that demons can be yoked to human benefit. The relevant\nverses of the Qur’an are all limited to passages dealing with Solomon, whom God is said\nto have given control over the jinn (Q 34:12; see also 27:17.39) or over “the dev ils” (al-\nshayāṭīn; 21:82, 38:37–38).19 The topos that Solomon was an expert conjurer of spirits is\nfound as early as the Wisdom of Solomon, which forms part of the Septuagint canon, and\n17 Also relevant is Q 37:158, which may be interpreted to mean that the Qur’an’s opponents declared the\njinn to be God’s ofspring.\n18 On the question of jinn worship, see DTEK 16–18. The evidence for jinn worship in pre- Islamic Arabia is\ngenerally scant. One case is al-K albī 1914, 34 (a reference that I owe to Al-A zmeh 2014, 210). H ere, the information\nthat a certain tribe used to “serve the jinn” (yaʿbudūna l- jinna) is given in explanation of a Qur’anic verse, though\nthe latter is not Q 34:41, which shares with al- Kalbī the phrase yaʿbudūna l- jinna, but 7:194. Nonetheless, t here\nis a manifest possibility that al- Kalbī’s piece of information is derived from the Qur’an.\n19 Q 27:39 reports that one of the members of Solomon’s court was an ʿifrīt min al- jinn. Rather than consid-\nering ʿifrīt to name a certain subclass of the jinn, it seems more likely that the word’s force here is to underline\nthe par tic u lar powers or cunning of an individual jinni. The word ʿifrīt is a Qur’anic hapax legomenon. For the\nways in which it is explained by Arabic lexicographers, see AEL 2089–2090.\n186 jinn, jinnah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an makes it plain\nthat it was not by any special magical prowess that Solomon was able to rely on the ser-\nvices of the jinn but solely by God’s permission (Q 34:12: wa- mina l- jinni man yaʿmalu\nbayna yadayhi bi- idhni rabbihi). This claim is paralleled by the so- called Second Targum\non the book of Esther (Salzberger 1907, 93–94; Grossfeld 1994, 26, 31 = Esth 1:2; Ego\n1996, 67, 73, 74). A poem from the dīwān of al- Nābighah al- Dhubyānī, too, reflects the\nidea that God endowed Solomon with dominion over the jinn: the deity, according to\nthe poem attributed to al- Nābighah, encouraged Solomon to “subdue the jinn” (khayyis\nal-j inna) and gave the latter permission (qad adhintu lahum) to build Tadmur, apparently\non Solomon’s behalf (DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 5:22–23, noted in KU 117 and BEQ 387; see\nalso Stetkevych 2017 and Grasso, forthcoming). While the Qur’an similarly insists that\nSolomon’s rule over the jinn was predicated on divine permission, the Islamic scripture\nadditionally makes it explicit that Solomon’s mastery over the jinn was an exceptional\nstate of afairs: in Surah 38, God’s conferral upon Solomon of control over the wind and\n“the dev ils” (al-s hayāṭīn; Q 38:36–38) responds to the latter’s prayer for “kingly rule\nthat will not be appropriate for anyone after me” (Q 38:35: hab lī mulkan lā yanbaghī\nli-a ḥadin min baʿdī).20 Consequently, any attempt to replicate Solomon’s powers, per-\nhaps by means of arcane magical arts, is futile; human dominion over the spirits is not\na con temporary prospect anymore.\nSolomon, demons, and angels in Q 2:102. An even more unequivocal Qur’anic rejec-\ntion of magic—w hich can for pre sent purposes be defined as the attempt to coerce super-\nhuman powers other than God into serving h uman interests— emerges from an isolated\nMedinan resonance of the theme of Solomon’s association with power ful spirits. This is\nfound in Q 2:102, containing the only Medinan reference to “the dev ils” (al- shayāṭīn) in\nthe plural (see QP 193–196). Taken together with the preceding verse, Q 2:101, the passage\naccuses the Israelites (who are addressed from v. 83 onwards) of discarding “God’s scrip-\nture” in favour of “that which the dev ils recited during the reign of Solomon.”21 “That which\nthe dev ils recited” is sorcery, and by indicting the Israelites for preferring sorcery over\nrevelation the verse polemically exploits what Crone calls the “well- attested phenomenon”\nof Jewish magic (QP 194–195). The dev ils at hand, meanwhile, may be assumed to be the\ndemons over whom God gave Solomon control according to passages like Q 21:82. Th ese\ndev ils, Q 2:102 continues, are guilty of “repudiating” (→ kafara) God, while Solomon\nhimself is expressly exempted from this charge (wa-m ā kafara sulaymānu wa-l ākinna\nl- shayāṭīna kafarū). The point must be that the seemingly miraculous powers enjoyed by\nSolomon do not make him guilty of unbelief, considering that these powers were granted\nby God himself. As regards the demons or dev ils, Q 2:102 goes on to assert that they w ere\nengaged in “teaching people magic” (yuʿallimūna l- nāsa l- siḥra) “and that which was sent\n20 I am grateful to Saqib Hussain for alerting me to the importance of Q 38:35.\n21 I assume that the preposition ʿalā in the phrase mā tatlū l-s hayāṭīnu ʿalā mulki sulaymāna is not to be\nunderstood in the sense of “against” (thus disagreeing with the translation given in DTEK 115–116).

The verse then provides an\nexample for the illicit knowledge at stake by referring to the sowing of discord between\na man and his spouse.\nThe scenario presented by Q 2:102 is one according to which the magical practices\nthat the Israelites allegedly prefer over “God’s scripture” are traced back to the wicked\ndemons over whom Solomon exercised divinely mandated authority, while the demons\nin turn derive their magical expertise from two angels peddling illicit knowledge by way\nof a divinely orchestrated test—a test that the demonic transmitters of magical spells and\nincantations are understood to have failed, like t hose following in their footsteps. What-\never exceptional powers Solomon enjoyed by virtue of his God- given authority over the\ndemons is thus presented as occupying a fundamentally dif er ent moral position than\ncon temporary sorcery. Moreover, similar to what is said in connection with Solomon\nat Q 34:12 (see above), any efficacy that magical spells and incantations might possess is\nmade contingent upon God: it is, in fact, only “by God’s permission (idhn)” that those\nacquiring the dark arts from Hārūt and Mārūt are able to inflict harm on people (Q 2:102:\nwa- mā hum bi-ḍ ārrīna bihi min aḥadin illā bi- idhni llāhi).\nMuhammad defended against the accusations of being possessed or a poet e tc. One\nof the most prominent motifs associated with the jinn is the Qur’anic opponents’ formulaic\naccusation, cited or refuted in a considerable number of early and l ater Meccan passages,\nthat Muhammad is jinn- possessed (majnūn, applied to Muhammad in Q 15:6, 37:36, 44:14,\n52:29, 68:2.51, 81:22, or bihi jinnatun / mā bi- . . . m in jinnatin, found in 7:184, 23:70, and\n34:8.46).22 This denunciation is sometimes concomitant with a dismissal of Muhammad\nas being a mere poet (shāʿir; Q 37:36 and 52:29–30; see also 21:5 and 69:41) or a soothsayer\n(kāhin; Q 52:29; see also 69:42). Muhammad is also accused of being a sorcerer (sāḥir;\nQ 10:2, 38:4), an invective that can likewise combine with majnūn (namely, in Q 51:39.52,\nalthough not with re spect to Muhammad). As so often, this aspect of Muhammad’s ministry\nis said to resemble the experience of his pred e ces sors. Thus, even though it is exclusively\nMuhammad who is denigrated as a mere poet, the accusation of being jinn- possessed\nis reported to have been directed at Noah (Q 23:25, 54:9) and Moses (Q 26:27, 51:39),\nand indeed one verse generalises that every one of God’s previous messengers (singu-\nlar: → rasūl) has been called “a sorcerer or someone possessed” (Q 51:52).23 Especially in\nlight of this universalising statement it is noteworthy that in the New Testament both John\nthe Baptist (Matt 11:18, Luke 7:33) and Jesus (John 7:20, 8:48–49.52, 10:20) are scorned\nas demoniacs (DTEK 23).\n22 Eichler makes the perceptive observation that verses employing majnūn are early Meccan, while those\nemploying bihi jinnatun or mā bi- . . . m in jinnatin are l ater Meccan (DTEK 23). I would add that this correlation\nonly holds fully if the early Meccan surahs are demarcated as proposed in HCI 161 (namely, as consisting of\nthose surahs who have a mean verse length below that of Q 50). By contrast, if one adopts Weil and Nöldeke’s\ndefinition of the early Meccan period, quite a few verses that have majnūn (15:6, 26:27, 37:36, 44:14) are not\nearly but middle Meccan.\n23 The accusation of sorcery is also prominent in connection with Moses; see, e.g., Q 40:24, 43:49, 51:39.\n188 jinn, jinnah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

At least to\nsome, the force of the vituperation may have been nothing more than “mad” or “crazy.”\nThe fact that one Qur’anic verse combines majnūn with shāʿir (Q 37:36) has sometimes\nbeen connected to the idea that poets were inspired by demons (see above), but this\nprob ably misunderstands the context of the statement (Bauer 2010, 721). The following\nverse insists that Muhammad “brings the truth” (v. 37: bal jāʾa bi- l-ḥ aqqi), which implies\nthat the main overlap between denigrating Muhammad as a poet and as being majnūn\nwas the allegation that he could not be relied upon to speak the truth— either because he\nwas not in full possession of his faculties (i.e., he was mad) or b ecause he deliberately and\ncreatively made t hings up, like poets. Pertinently, explicit accusations that Muhammad\nhas merely “fabricated” (iftarā) the Qur’anic proclamations are frequent in Meccan surahs\n(Q 10:38, 11:13.35, 16:101, 21:5, 25:4, 32:3, 34:8.43, 46:8), and Q 34:8 (adduced in DTEK 25),\nwhere the charges of fabricating lies and of being possessed figure side by side, confirms\nthat there was semantic proximity between t hese allegations: Muhammad, his accusers\nwere saying, was e ither purposefully making preposterous claims or was unable to help\nit. This understanding of the commonality between being majnūn and being a poet is\nconfirmed by Q 26:226, accusing poets of “saying what they do not do” (yaqūlūna mā lā\nyafʿalūn). Poets, it seems, had a reputation for indulging in outrageous boasting that did\nnot merit being taken seriously (DTEK 27 and Bauer 2010, 725–730; on the entire passage\nQ 26:224–226, see also Seidensticker 2011a, Neuwirth 2010, 716–722, and PP 429–432). It\nis likely that it was precisely in this sense that Muhammad was scorned as a poet. Similarly,\nto call Muhammad majnūn may simply have been to allege that he was raving mad rather\nthan to impute to him the sort of super natural inspiration that was occasionally associated\nwith pre- Islamic poets (thus already DTEK 25).24\nOn the other hand, two passages from the early Meccan surahs Q 26 and 81 suggest\nthat maybe the Qur’an did need to defend itself specifically against the imputation of\noriginating from demonic inspiration. Thus, Q 81:25 maintains that Muhammad’s pro-\nnouncements are “not the speech of a devil (→ shayṭān) deserving to be pelted (→ rajīm).”\nThe affirmation comes only a few verses a fter a denial that “yourp companion”—to wit,\nMuhammad—is “jinn-p ossessed” (majnūn) in Q 81:22. This creates a likelihood that vv. 22\nand 25 can be taken to explicate each other, which would point to a link between jinn-\npossession and inspiration. The second passage is Q 26:210–212. It avers, like Q 81:25, that\nwhat Muhammad proclaims “has not been brought down by the dev ils” (wa- mā tanaz-\nzalat bihi l- shayāṭīn) and then goes on to explain that the dev ils could not have done so\n(v. 211: wa- mā yastaṭīʿūn) since they are “prevented from listening” (v. 212: innahum ʿani\nl- samʿi la- maʿzūlūn). The latter statement must allude to the Qur’anic claim, discussed\nabove, that the divine council is robustly insulated from unauthorised eavesdropping.\nLater in the same surah (Q 26:221–223), the topic of demonic inspiration receives further\nattention: “the dev ils,” we learn, “descend upon many a wicked fabricator of falsehoods”\n(v. 222: tanazzalu ʿalā kulli affākin athīm). As v. 223 adds, demons attempt to eavesdrop\non the celestial council in order to gain information other wise inaccessible to them, yet\n“most of them are liars,” that is, cannot be relied upon to divulge truth (yulqūna l- samʿa\nwa- aktharuhum kādhibūn). It is salient that both in Surah 26 and in Surah 81 the denial\nthat the Qur’anic revelations have been transmitted by demons (Q 26:210–212, 81:25)\n24 See Bauer 2010, 723: “ there is not necessarily a connection between being a poet and being possessed.”\njinn, jinnah 189", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Taken together, both Surah 81 and Surah 26 therefore lend some support to\nthe understanding that calling Muhammad majnūn or “possessed” did not merely convey\na general allegation of mental derangement but also implied reliance on untrustworthy\ndemonic inspiration. If that is correct, then the accusation of being jinn- possessed both\nacknowledged Muhammad’s claim to be tapping into some form of super natural inspiration\nand si mult a neously deflated this claim in such a manner as to avoid conceding that he was\nimparting theological truth and positing valid behavioural norms.\nWhat ever one makes of the two passages just discussed, the common denominator of\nclassifying Muhammad as “jinn- possessed” and as a poet, and prob ably also of calling him\na soothsayer or a sorcerer, was to dismiss his claim to articulate propositions and norms\nthat deserved to be taken seriously. In other words, all of the four labels in question should\nbe considered to be polemical; they do not constitute uncomprehending but sincere at-\ntempts by Muhammad’s hearers at categorising his claim to be a recipient of prophetic\nrevelations in accordance with the only categories of super natural inspiration available\nto them (thus Noth 1994, 19–20). Th ere is, after all, no compelling reason to assume that\nMuhammad’s Meccan audience was unacquainted with Jewish and Christian notions of\ndivine revelation. To the contrary, as has been observed by more than one scholar, Mu-\nhammad’s recipients must have had a reasonably firm grasp of Biblical narratives (HCI\n62), and they also seem to have been familiar enough with the notion of divine revela-\ntion in order to confront Muhammad’s claim to prophecy with objections that w ere not\nobviously silly (see under → malak and → ashraka). Another reason to assume that the\npoint of classing Muhammad as possessed, a poet, or a soothsayer was straightforwardly\npolemical rather than an honest attempt at conceptualising the unfamiliar is the fact that\nthe Qur’anic opponents also accuse Muhammad of having in ven ted or copied his alleged\nrevelations (e.g., Q 16:103, 25:5, 32:3). It seems highly probable that an accusation of fab-\nrication or derivation from untrustworthy sources was also the main thrust behind the\nlabels under consideration.25\njannah | garden\nFurther vocabulary discussed: nahar | river, stream naʿīm | delight, bliss ʿadn |\nEden khuld | immortality maʾwā | refuge firdaws | paradise zamharīr | exces-\nsive cold ittakaʾa intr. | t o recline razaqa ditr. | to provide s.o. with s.th. mu-\ntashābih | resembling one another; indistinguishable ishtahā tr. | to desire s.th.\n25 One might argue that classifying Muhammad as a soothsayer, or kāhin, could at least rely on certain\nliterary affinities between the Qur’an and the utterances of ancient Arabian diviners, namely, the use of sajʿ or\nrhymed and rhythmic prose (on which see Stewart 1990). But no equivalent argument from literary affinity could\nseriously be made with re spect to the allegation that Muhammad was a poet (Bauer 2010, 713–715, 722–723).\nThe upshot is again that at least the poetic label, and prob ably also the mantic one, was not a neutral attempt at\nphenomenological classification.\n190 jannah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Jannah, “garden,” is a frequent\nQur’an term for the eschatological paradise but can also designate earthly gardens\n(Q 6:99.141, 18:32–42) as well as the paradise of Adam and Eve (Q 2:35, 7:19.22.27; CDKA\n63). The Qur’an presumably considers the latter to be identical with the eschatological par-\nadise, as does, for instance, Ephrem (see Beck 1957a, On Paradise, nos 5:5 and 8:10). In ref-\nerence to the eschatological paradise, the Qur’an employs both the singular al- jannah, “the\ngarden” (e.g., Q 2:82.111.214), in use from the early Meccan period onwards (see Q 81:13,\n88:10, 89:30), and the plural jannāt (e.g., Q 3:15), which is equally attested from early on\n(see Q 74:40, 78:16). Very often, the plural jannāt is found as part of the formula jannāt\ntajrī min taḥtihā l- anhār, “gardens under neath which rivers (singular: nahar) flow,” which\nis treated in more detail below, and as a component of the constructs jannāt al- naʿīm, “the\ngardens of delight” (e.g., Q 5:65, 10:9, 22:56) and jannāt ʿadn (e.g., Q 9:72, 13:23, 16:31).1\nTwo further constructs containing the plural jannāt, which are however rare, are jannat\nal-k huld, “the garden of immortality” (Q 25:15; → khalada), and jannāt al-m aʾwā, “the\ngardens of refuge” (Q 32:19; cf. 79:41; see Horovitz 1975, 61, and Künstlinger 1931, 620–622).\nUsage of firdaws, derived from Greek paradeisos, is very sporadic in the Qur’an (Q 18:107,\n23:11; see Horovitz 1975, 61–62, and Künstlinger 1931, 624), despite the fact that, as Horovitz\nnotes, Syriac pardaysā is a common term for the eschatological paradise and the preferred\ndesignation for it in Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise (Beck 1957a).\nTerminological precursors in Jewish and Christian parlance. The word jannah may\nbe a loan from Aramaic, but if so it is one that predates the Qur’an, since jannah = “garden”\nis attested already in ancient Arabic poetry (JPND 196; Horovitz 1975, 60; see also NB\n42).2 Jannāt ʿadn in par tic u lar is obviously descended from the Biblical “garden of Eden”\n(Hebrew: gan ʿēden; Gen 2:8.15, 3:23.24).3 Strikingly, the Qur’an never uses the expression\nʿadn in connection with Adam and Eve (WMJA 99; Horovitz 1975, 61; Künstlinger 1931,\n617–618). As for jannāt al- naʿīm or jannat naʿīm (Q 56:89, 70:38; 52:17 has jannāt wa- naʿīm;\nsee Horovitz 1975, 60–61, and Künstlinger 1931, 619–620), the two expressions are, in\nefect, literal translations of gan ʿēden (JPND 196), in so far as Hebrew ʿēden can mean\n“bliss” or “delight” (HALOT 792), even if Gen 2:8 clearly uses the expression as a place\nname. Most likely, jannāt al- naʿīm / jannat naʿīm reflects the Septuagint’s rendering of gan\nʿēden as paradeisos tēs tryphēs, “the paradise of delight” (Künstlinger 1931, 619; see Gen\n3:23.24, Joel 2:3, and Ezek 31:9), which has also left traces in Syriac.4 As Horovitz remarks,\n1 It is noteworthy that jannāt ʿadn seems to appear somewhat l ater in Qur’anic discourse than jannāt al- naʿīm,\nwhich has a number of early Meccan occurrences (37:43, 56:12, 68:34). By contrast, the earliest occurrences of\njannāt ʿadn are prob ably Q 19:61, 20:76, and 38:50 (see Horovitz 1975, 60–61).\n2 See also Al- Jallad 2017a, 145 and 171, documenting the diminutive gonainath in a Graeco- Arabic papyrus\nfrom the early 500s.\n3 Onqelos and other targums have ginta d-ʿ ēdan (Künstlinger 1931, 617); the Peshitta, however, uses pardaysā\nda-ʿ den at Gen 2:15 and 3:24.25.\n4 As pointed out by Brock and Kiraz in Ephrem 2006, 12–13, n. 5 (commenting on Beck 1957a, On Paradise,\nno. 5:14), Ephrem’s expression ganntā d-g ewātā, “garden of delights” would seem to reflect the Septuagint’s\njannah 191", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:214", "title": "Page 214", "locator": "pdf_page:214", "text": "it is specifically in Jewish parlance that the expression gan ʿēden customarily functions as a\nterm for the heavenly paradise (JPND 196–197; see DTTM 1045). Th ere may consequently\nbe a Jewish background to the term jannāt ʿadn (JPND 196–197).5 However, the Qur’an’s\nfrequent absolute usage al-j annah for the heavenly paradise corresponds most closely\nto Syriac ganntā, “the garden,” which can have the same eschatological sense (Mingana\n1927, 85; FVQ 103–104), as exemplified by Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise (Beck 1957a, nos\n7:28–29, 8:1.10–11, 10:14, 11:5.10, and 12:9). By contrast, rabbinic texts only rarely call the\neschatological paradise “the garden” simpliciter (Künstlinger 1931, 618).\nThe general features of paradise in the Qur’an. The Qur’anic portrayal of paradise\n(on which see generally Horovitz 1975 and Wild 2010) is that of an idyllic and temperate\nlocation in which the God- fearing rest “in the shade and by springs” (Q 77:41: inna\nl- muttaqīna fī ẓilālin wa- ʿuyūn)6 and where they are “ will not see”— i.e., are not exposed\nto—“ [scorching] sun nor severe cold” (Q 76:13: lā yarawna fīhā shamsan wa- lā zamharīrā).\nThe phrase just quoted has a literal parallel in a poem by al- Aʿshā Maymūn (Ḥusayn 1983,\nno. 12:17: lam tara shamsan wa- lā zamharīrā; see also Horovitz 1975, 69–70, and Bitsch\n2020, 335–336); but specifically with regard to the hereafter, the same point is also made\nin Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise, where it is denied that t here is any “harmful frost” or\n“scorching heat” in paradise (Beck 1957a, On Paradise, no. 11:2, noted in Bitsch 2020, 348).\nElsewhere, too, Ephrem stresses the perfectly balanced climate of paradise (Beck 1957a,\nOn Paradise, no. 10:2). The idea is ancient, as shown by similar statements in the Avesta\n(Bitsch 2020, 340–343).7\nWithin this bucolic setting, the Qur’an, especially the Meccan Qur’an, depicts paradise\nas a banquet. The inhabitants of paradise are adorned with bracelets and dressed in fine\ngarments (Q 18:31, 22:23, 35:33, 44:53, 76:12.21), and like the guests invited to a feast recline\n(ittakaʾa) on couches (Q 18:31, 36:56, 38:51, 52:20, 55:54.76, 56:15–16, 76:13),8 attended\nby eternally youthful cup- bearers (Q 52:24, 56:17–19, 76:19; see also 37:45, 43:71, and\n76:15–17).9 Dif ere nt kinds of food, especially fruit but also meat and drink, including wine,\nare available to them in boundless abundance (Q 13:35, 36:57, 37:42, 38:51, 43:73, 44:55,\nparadeisos tēs tryphēs. It is conceivable that an epithet like jannat al- naʿīm was current for paradise already in\npre- Qur’anic Arabic.\n5 But note that on occasion, Ephrem, too, uses the name Eden in connection with the heavenly paradise\n(Beck 1957a, On Paradise, nos 5:5, 9:2, and 11:12).\n6 For shade in paradise, see also Q 4:57, 13:35, 36:56, 56:28–30, 76:14; for the springs of paradise, see also\n15:45, 44:52, 51:15, 55:50, 76:6.18, 83:28, and 88:12 (cf. also 56:31).\n7 Neuwirth 2017, 503, translates zamharīr as “scorching heat” (see also ibid., 512). Her commentary adduces a\nfootnote by Horovitz that questions w hether zamharīr r eally means “cold” (Horovitz 1975, 70, n. 11) and suggests\nthat its original meaning might be the same as Syriac zahrīrā, “ray, beam” (see SL 368–369). It bears noting,\nthough, that Horovitz himself is considerably more cautious than Neuwirth makes him out to be. Further in\nsupport of zamharīr = “heat,” Neuwirth references Rev 7:16 (noted in Rudolph 1922, 14, and BEQ 458), which says\nabout those allowed to worship before God’s throne that “the sun w ill not strike them, nor any scorching heat.”\nHowever, the parallel to Q 76:13 that is provided by Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise 11:2 makes it far less compelling\nto read the Qur’anic verse as corresponding to the double negation of excessive heat in Rev 7:16, at the price of\ndiscarding the transmitted meaning of zamharīr. For a detailed study of the term zamharīr, its interpretation in\nthe post- Qur’anic Islamic tradition, and the chill of hell in Zoroastrian and other lit er a ture, see now Bitsch 2020,\nwho endorses the understanding that Q 76:13 refers to heat and cold (Bitsch 2020, 350).\n8 Note the use of muttakaʾ for a this-w orldly banquet in Q 12:31. On the couches of paradise, see also Q 15:47,\n37:44, 56:34, 83:23.35, and 88:13.\n9 Q 13:23 conveys the impression that the inhabitants of paradise are served by angels. Perhaps this is an\nattempt to clarify that the youthful cup- bearers appearing in chronologically earlier passages are angels. See also\nGrimme 1895, 160, according to whom the cup- bearing youths “are transformed into angels.”\n192 jannah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, Syriac texts like Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise—w hose pertinence to\nthe Qur’anic portrayal of paradise was recognised as early as Hubert Grimme (Grimme\n1895, 160–161)—s imilarly employ banquet motifs and repeatedly associate paradise with\nabundant fruit (e.g., Beck 1957a, On Paradise, nos 5:15, 6:11–13.15, 7:3.16–18.21.26, 9:4–6;\nsee Andrae 1932, 71–72, and Sinai 2017a, 265). As we saw above, Ephrem also praises the\ntemperate climate of paradise and its freedom of frost and heat, recalling Q 76:13. The\nnotion of paradisiacal feasting figures in Jewish texts as well (Künstlinger 1931, 626–627),\nand as Künstlinger notes a Talmudic dictum denying that t here w ill be eating, drinking,\nor procreation in the world to come presupposes that contrary views were not unheard\nof (b. Bәr. 17a).\nAgainst the background of the preceding parallels from Syriac lit er a ture, it may be\nproposed that the ostensible insistence that the fruit of paradise is exactly like earthly\nfruit in Q 2:25 is in conversation with the claim developed in one of Ephrem’s hymns\nthat the food of paradise is “spiritual” and is carried by fragrant breezes (Beck 1957a, On\nParadise, no. 9:7–17), in contrast with corporeal food that ends up as excrement (Beck\n1957a, On Paradise, no. 9:13, opposing ṭʿūmā d- pagrānē and ṭʿūmē d- rūḥānīn; see also ibid.,\nno. 9:23). Towards the end of the same passage, Ephrem suggests that it is actually the vi-\nsion (ḥezwā) of God that w ill provide the souls with nourishment in paradise (Beck 1957a,\nno. 9:18.22–29; cf. 1 Cor 13:12), just as Moses was sustained by the vision of God while he\nsojourned on Mount Sinai (Exod 34:28)—a Biblical antetype that puts to shame t hose who\nwould “greedily covet” (verb: etyaʿʿan) the prospect of being supplied with material food\nin paradise (Beck 1957a, no. 9:22). Another one of Ephrem’s hymns expands further on\nthe spiritual nature of paradise and on the resulting inadequacy— but also inevitability—of\ndescribing it in corporeal terms (Beck 1957a, On Paradise, no. 11:4–8). Accordingly, the\n10 Specifically regarding the statement in Q 47:15 that the rivers of paradise carry w ater, milk, wine, and\nhoney, see Grimme 1895, 161 (pointing to a passage in Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise that corresponds to Beck\n1957a, On Paradise, no. 10:6), and Horovitz 1975, 64.\n11 For an alternative interpretation, which al- Ṭabarī labours to refute with great ingenuity, see KK 15: the\nfruits of paradise are so perfect that they are indistinguishable from one another. See also SQ 19.\n12 The literal meaning of mutashābih is “resembling one another.” However, the assumption that the word\ncan also have the strong sense of indistinguishability is confirmed by Q 2:70, where tashābaha ʿalā is “to be\nindistinguishable to s.o.”\n13 For an entirely unconvincing rejection of Horovitz’s results, see Künstlinger 1931, 631–632.\njannah 193", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic paradise is\nthus emphatically continuous with, and intelligible in terms of, humanity’s pre sent state of\nexistence, which features miscellaneous phenomena providing a foretaste of the delights\nof paradise, such as divinely given “gardens and springs” (Q 26:57.134.147, 44:25; see also\n36:34)16 or shade (Q 16:81). One might counter this assessment with a dictum attributed\nto Ibn ʿAbbās, according to which the only thing that this world and paradise have in\ncommon is mere names (laysa fī l-d unyā shayʾun mimmā fī l-j annati illā l-a smāʾu; e.g.,\nIbn Qutaybah 1973, main text, 80; see also Hoover 2007, 65–66). Yet the Qur’an does not\ngenerally endorse such discontinuity, even if Q 32:17 does say that “no one knows” the\ndelights that God holds in store for the pious (Lange 2016a, 2–3).\nThe pleasures of the Qur’anic paradise must not lead one to overlook that paradise\nis also, and perhaps most importantly, a place of proximity to and communion with\nGod: according to one passage, the residents of paradise will “look towards” their Lord\n(Q 75:22–23; on the issue of divine visibility, see also → allāh), and elsewhere the escha-\ntologically blessed, or some of them, are called “ those brought near” (al-m uqarrabūn;\nQ 56:11.88, 83:21.28; see also 3:45), namely, to God. Q 33:44 speaks auspiciously of the\nday on which the believers w ill “meet” God (yawma yalqawnahu).17 In its own way, the\nQur’an therefore fully endorses Ephrem’s expectation that the blessed will be engrossed in\na beatific vision of God. Eschatological propinquity to God is likely also conveyed by the\nfrequent promise that the righ teous and God- fearing will receive eschatological reward\nor wages (→ ajr) “with” (ʿinda) their Lord (Q 2:62.112.262.274.277, 3:15.169.199, 6:127,\n8:4, 10:2, 39:34, 42:22, 43:35, 68:34, 98:8; see also 54:55): especially in light of the verses\nreferenced earlier, it stands to reason that such eschatological ʿinda affirmations do not\nmerely specify the source of the believers’ heavenly rewards but convey spatial closeness\nto God. Even the paradisiacal pleasures as such have a relational significance beyond their\nimmanent enjoyability, in so far as they signal divine recognition: the blessed in paradise\nare said to be “honoured” by God (Q 37:42, 70:35: mukramūn; see also 36:27). In general,\nthe status of the residents of paradise is that of respected guests entertained by a divine\nhost who is supremely solicitous to meet their e very need. It is on behalf of their divine\n14 I am not suggesting that this is necessarily Ephrem’s view, as he makes it clear that the soul will only enter\nparadise together with the body (Beck 1957a, On Paradise, no. 8:3–11).\n15 Cf. also the promise that the blessed are g oing to be given what ever they “wish” for (Q 16:31, 25:16, 39:34,\n42:22, 50:35) or what ever they “request” (Q 36:57, 41:31).\n16 Note that Q 44:52 uses the same phrase in the context of paradise.\n17 I owe my awareness of this verse to Usman Shaikh.

All in all, the vario us delights\nand comforts bestowed on the residents of paradise thus have a distinctly interpersonal\npurport: they are the outward form that is taken by a completed relationship with God.19\nOne may add that the relational aspects of paradise encompass communion between\nGod’s guests themselves: in reclining on their couches, they “face one another” (Q 15:47,\n37:44, 44:53, 56:16: mutaqābilīn). As one scholar has put it, “in the community of paradise,\nthere is no harsh word or strife” (Wild 2010, 627): in contrast with the bitter arguments that\nplay out among the denizens of hell (→ jahannam), God has removed all rancour (ghill)\nfrom the breasts of the residents of paradise (Q 7:43, 15:47: wa- nazaʿnā mā fī ṣudūrihim\nmin ghillin), turning them into brothers (Q 15:47).20 Paradise is not, therefore, a mere\naggregation of individual pods of plea sure but a place of joint feasting in the presence\nof God, predicated on the efacement of all antisocial human emotions towards fellow\nparadise- dwellers.21\nVisual and verbal contact between paradise and hell. A peculiar feature of the\nQur’anic paradise— which two Medinan verses say is as wide as the heavens and the earth\n(Q 3:133, 57:21; see also Künstlinger 1931, 624–625)—is the fact that at least parts of it\nappear to adjoin hell (→ jahannam) and to be located within earshot of it, allowing the\nsaved and the damned to converse with one another (Q 7:44.50), albeit by “calling out”\n(nādā). Given that the blessed inquire with the damned about how the latter are faring\n(Q 7:44), one might infer that there is no direct visual contact between heaven and hell,\nbut an early Meccan passage clearly maintains that the occupants of paradise are in fact\n18 Paret argues, plausibly, that verses like Q 10:10 speak of the greeting addressed to the blessed rather than\nof a greeting uttered by them. This is in any case clear regarding Q 15:46 and 50:34.\n19 While it is impor tant to acknowledge this interpersonal, communion- centred dimension of the Qur’anic\nafterlife, I would refrain from describing it as radically transformative in comparison to pre- eschatological h uman\nexistence. As much of the textual data treated earlier shows, h uman existence is completed, fulfilled, made whole\nin paradise (e.g., by the removal of scarcity and by the removal of interhuman aggression, as briefly discussed in\nwhat follows), and entering paradise amounts to deliverance from the unspeakable horror of eternal perdition,\nmaking the pursuit of paradise insuperably momentous. Yet it is eminently arguable that the Qur’anic vision of\nthe afterlife does not involve the radical remaking of human existence into something else entirely, such as John\nHick’s “limitlessly better possibility” (e.g., Hick 1989, 32); the degree of commensurability that obtains between\npre- eschatological and eschatological existence is high in the Qur’an. See also Zirker 1993, 92–121, arguing that\nthe Qur’anic teaching is not soteriological in the same sense as Christ ian ity.

But one’s answer to the question of w hether the Qur’anic afterlife is transformative or not w ill undoubtedly\ndepend on how one is inclined to weigh some of the textual evidence. For instance, should one emphasise that\neven the inhabitants of paradise will continue to have a vital self or → nafs and to experience desire (Q 21:102,\n41:31, 43:71), or should one rather accentuate a verse that may be read as promising that the vital self w ill in the\nafterlife be transmuted into a “soul that is at peace” (Q 89:27, also discussed u nder → nafs)?\n20 Although Wild does not cite Q 7:43 and 15:47, they provide much better evidence for his claim than\n56:25–26, which he takes to say that the blessed greet one another with the words “peace, peace.” In fact, it seems\nmore likely that this refers to the welcome extended to them according to parallels like Q 15:46, 50:34, and 56:91.\n21 Note also Q 59:10, where a subgroup of the believers is portrayed as praying precisely for such removal\nof rancour towards fellow believers.\njannah 195", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But Surah 7 goes on to\nstate that the domains of paradise and hell are separated by a partition (Q 7:46: ḥijāb), and\nQ 57:13 similarly says that the believers and the hypocrites w ill be separated by a “wall with\na gate,” which is here understood to encompass paradise and keep the sinners outside\n(cf. Q 15:43–44; see also Horovitz 1975, 58–59, and under → al- raḥmān). Again according\nto Surah 7, the “heights” (al- aʿrāf) of the partition between paradise and hell are occupied\nby “men,” prob ably angelic guards (DTEK 113–114), who in their turn likewise “call out”\nboth to the residents of paradise and of hell (Q 7:46–49).23 It is not obvious how this image\nof paradise as a walled and guarded enclosure surrounded by hell is to be reconciled with\nthe image of paradise as an elevated garden on a mountaintop that is implied by other\npassages (see below) and that may also form the background to Q 37:51–55. However, one\nshould note that other traditions, too, such as Syriac Christian lit er a ture, deploy more\nthan one set of images for paradise (Minov 2016).\nThe Qur’anic assumption that t here is a possibility of verbal communication between\nthe inhabitants of paradise and of hell is presumably a variation on the New Testamental\nparable about the rich man tormented in hell, who looks up to see a pauper called Lazarus\nin the bosom of Abraham (Luke 16:19–31; see already Rudolph 1922, 15; DTEK 114; CQ 166;\nAhrens 1935, 104). Particularly striking is the fact that both in the Qur’an and in the parable\nfrom Luke, the inmates (or inmate) of hell request being cooled by w ater from paradise\n(cf. Q 7:50 and Luke 16:24). Like other aspects of the Qur’anic portrayal of paradise, the\nscene from Luke also figures in Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise (Beck 1957a, nos 1:12–13 and\n7:27).24 The link is further substantiated by the fact that both the Qur’an (Q 83:34) and\nEphrem, in amplifying Luke 16:19–31, hold that the blessed w ill mock the inmates of hell\n(Beck 1957a, On Paradise, no. 1:14).\n“Gardens under neath which rivers flow” (jannāt tajrī min taḥtihā l- anhār). More\nthan thirty Qur’anic verses promise the right eous access to “gardens under neath which\nrivers flow,” a formula that is often followed by the tail khālidīna fīhā or khālidīna fīhā\nabadan, “remaining there forever” (→ khalada), as in Q 2:25. The garden- river formula\nmakes its appearance already in some Meccan surahs (Q 13:35, 14:23, 16:31, 18:31, 20:76,\n25:10; cf. also 29:58 and 39:20)25 but is particularly frequent in Medinan ones (e.g., Q 2:266,\n22 For another pos si ble piece of evidence in favour of direct visual contact, see Q 83:34–35: the believers\nwill mock the repudiators while resting on couches, “looking about” (v. 35: ʿalā l- arāʾiki yanẓurūn; see Gwynne\n2002, 415).\n23 For a dif er ent understanding of the “men” (rijāl) stationed on the “heights” (al-a ʿrāf; Q 7:46.48) of\nthis partition wall, see Horovitz 1975, 62, according to whom t hese form an intermediate category of inividuals\nwho merit neither paradise nor damnation. But this is difficult to square with the fact that the men in question\n“recognise every one by their sign” (Q 7:46: yaʿrifūna kullan bi- sīmāhum), which rather fits the theory that the\nmen on the heights are guardians.\n24 According to Luke, there is visual contact between heaven and hell, as in Q 37:54–55, although the rich\nman only sees Lazarus and Abraham from “far away” (Luke 16:23). Rather than by a partition wall, paradise\nand hell are here separated by a “ great chasm” making it impossible to cross between the two domains (Luke\n16:26). Both aspects also figure in Ephrem’s Hymns on Paradise (Beck 1957a, no. 1:12; on visual contact between\nparadise and hell, see also no. 7:29). Ephrem adds that the chasm also cuts through any afection and empathy\nthat the blessed might other wise have felt for relatives of theirs who have ended up in hell, so as to preclude that\nthe blessed might be pained by the sight of tormented children, brothers, and relatives (no. 1:13).\n25 Q 85:11 also has the formula, but the verse has been convincingly identified as a later insertion (Neuwirth\n2007, 223–224). It may well be Medinan (PP 342).\n196 jannah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

More likely, the expression bespeaks an understanding of paradise\nas stretched out along an upwards slope, rising above streams of water further below (KK\n14–15). In fact, the early Meccan verses Q 69:22 and 88:10 explic itly describe the garden of\nparadise as being “elevated” (ʿāliyah; Ahrens 1935, 107), and Adam, Eve, and the devil are\ntold to “descend” or “go down” (habaṭa) from paradise (Q 2:36.38, 7:13.24, 20:123). All of this\naccords with Ephrem’s portrayal of paradise as being located on a lofty mountain (Grimme\n1895, 159, n. 11; Reynolds 2010a, 59–60; Reynolds 2018, 33–34; Lange 2016a, 60; see Beck\n1957a, On Paradise, no. 1:4). This image persists in the Cave of Trea sures (Minov 2016, 147,\nciting, inter alia, Ri 1987, ch. 3:15). As Sergey Minov notes in a general overview of the motif\nof paradise as a cosmic mountain in Syriac lit er a ture, the idea—w hich makes it pos sib le to\nattribute to paradise both terrestrial and celestial aspects (cf. Lange 2016a, 58–59)—is par-\ntic ul ar to Syriac Christ iani ty and partly draws on Iran ian traditions (Minov 2016, 144–155).\nAn alternative understanding would be to interpret the phrase “gardens under neath\nwith rivers flow” as employing “gardens” metonymically in the sense of the “trees, fruit,\nand plants” of paradise rather than its “ground,” such that “gardens under neath with riv-\ners flow” is equivalent to “gardens under neath whose trees, fruit, and plants rivers flow”\n(Ṭab. 1:406). In favour of this understanding, one might marshal Q 2:266 (pointed out in\nReynolds 2018, 34), where the formula is applied to earthly gardens, which as such cannot\nnecessarily be presumed to be located on an elevation (note also Q 6:6 and 43:51, which\nspeak of “rivers flowing under neath” humans, such as Pha raoh, in a non- eschatological\ncontext). However, it may also be that the three verses in question are simply derivative\nfrom the Qur’an’s routine epithet for paradise and are rhetorically intended to endow the\nearthly gardens in question with a paradisiacal allure.\njāhada intr./tr. | to contend (against s.o.)\nFurther vocabulary discussed: qātala tr./intr. | to fight (s.o.) alladhīna kafarū, al-\nkāfirūn, al-k uffār pl. | the repudiators ashraka tr.

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:220", "title": "Page 220", "locator": "pdf_page:220", "text": "is indeed an impor tant feature of the Medinan surahs (HCI 188–192), a diachronically\nsensitive examination of the Qur’anic employment of jāhada shows that the word’s de-\nvelopment into an efective synonym of qātala, “to fight,” is a secondary development.\nAs argued below, the translation “to contend” is best suited to convey the term’s basic\nmeaning in the Qur’an, which centres on the believers’ readiness to face and overcome\nopposition to the Qur’anic kerygma, whether by discursive means or, as in the Medinan\nsurahs, by force of arms.1 This use of Arabic jāhada in the sense of confronting religious\nopposition could be original to the Qur’an, although it is noteworthy that the Qur’anic\nconcept of “contending” has been connected with agonistic and athletic meta phors de-\nployed in ancient Christian texts, such as the idea that ascetics are engaged in struggling\nand fighting on behalf of Christ (Schmid, forthcoming b, ch. 4). The verb jāhada occurs\nin a poem from the dīwān of al- Nābighah, which describes a female onager attempting to\noutrun a male chasing her: “when she contends against him in running (idhā jāhadathu\nl- shadda), he exerts himself (jadda)” (DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 21:9; see also Bauer 1992,\n2:61). Similar to the Qur’an, the word here connotes determined strug gle against an op-\nponent of sorts, but the strug gle at hand is not a clash of opposing convictions but a male\nonager’s aggressive pursuit of a potential mate.\nUsage in the Meccan surahs. The chronologically first Qur’anic occurrences of the\nverb jāhada are in five Meccan verses, Q 25:52, 29:6.8.69, and 31:15.2 The putatively\nearliest one of these, Q 25:52, commands the Qur’anic Messenger “not to obey the re-\npudiators” (fa-l ā tuṭiʿi l-k āfirīna; → kafara) and to “zealously contend against them by\nmeans of it” (wa-j āhidhum bihi jihādan kabīrā).3 The meaning of jāhada here is clearly\nto do with religious or ideological opposition: the Messenger is bidden to confront\nthose who are ungrateful for God’s favours (v. 50) and who serve other beings than\nGod (v. 55). The free- floating, antecedent- less “it” of Q 25:52 (which occurs already in\nv. 50) refers either to the Qur’anic proclamations or perhaps to the basic message of\nthe surrounding passage, rehearsing sundry aspects of God’s power and beneficence.4\nAccordingly, the manner in which the Messenger is meant to oppose the repudiators in\nQ 25:52 is by broadcasting the divine revelations granted to him or by preaching their\ngeneral message. “Contending” being a discursive act here, the customary translations\n“to strive against” or even “to strug gle against” (e.g., Arberry 1955 or Jones 2007) are\nnot entirely satisfactory.5\nThe same connotation of ideological conflict is unmistakable in Q 29:8 and 31:14–15,\ntoo. They form a partial doublet affirming that God has “charged humans to treat their\nparents well” (Q 29:8: wa- waṣṣaynā l-i nsāna bi-w ālidayhi ḥusnan; 31:14 lacks ḥusnan),\nwhich is then restricted by the proviso that “if they contend against youS to make you\nassociate (verb: → ashraka) with me something of which you have no knowledge, then\ndo not obey them” (Q 29:8: wa-in jāhadāka li- tushrika bī mā laysa laka bihi ʿilmun fa-\nlā tuṭiʿhumā; 31:15 has ʿalā an tushrika). Here, too, the confrontation implied by jāhada\n1 See the use of “to contend” in AEL 474, where jāhada is glossed as “using, or exerting, one’s utmost power,\nefforts, endeavours, or ability, in contending with an object of disapprobation.”\n2 Q 16:110 is a Medinan insertion.\n3 For other occurrences of the lā tuṭiʿ command, see Q 68:8 (early Meccan) and 33:1.48 (Medinan).\n4 It is not unusual for the Qur’an to use a pronoun without clear antecedent (“it”) to refer to the corpus of\nrevelations received by Muhammad or their general content. See, for instance, Q 36:69, 38:86–87, 53:4, 81:27.\n5 In an earlier publication, I endorsed “to strug gle” over “to strive” (HCI 210, n. 5).\n198 jāhada", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The transitive use of\njāhada, then, should be treated as basic, resembling other third-f orm verbs that take an\naccusative complement, such as qātala + acc., “to fight s.o.” or lāyana + acc., “to treat s.o.\ngently” (see Wright 1974, 1:32–34; cf. Larcher 2020, 132). Consequently, jāhada does not\nmerely signify an individual expending of efort and exertion, but rather the determined\nconfronting of an antagonist—s pecifically, in the Qur’an, of an antagonist committed to a\nconflicting belief system (HCI 210, n. 5). The remaining two Meccan occurrences of jāhada\nin Q 29:6 and 29:69 are less informative, although the latter verse is noteworthy for linking\nthe verb with the preposition fī, by speaking of alladhīna jāhadū fīnā, “t hose who contend\nfor our [namely, God’s] sake.”7 As we s hall presently see, a similar combination of jāhada\nwith fī is found in many Medinan verses.\nThe Medinan surahs’ shift to militant activism. The Medinan Qur’an contains far more\noccurrences of jāhada than the Meccan surahs (thirty- one as opposed to five). In many\nMedinan passages, jāhada collocates with the prepositional phrase fī sabīl allāh, “on God’s\npath” (→ sabīl). The efective significance of the phrase would seem to be “for God’s cause,”\nas shown by the use of fī followed by a direct reference to God rather than to God’s path in\nQ 29:69 (see above) and in 22:78 (jāhidū fī llāhi ḥaqqa jihādihi, “contend for God’s sake as\nbehoves him”). Medinan verses enjoin the believers to “contend on God’s path” (jāhada fī\nsabīl allāh), laud t hose who do so, or other wise imply that “contending” is a crucial aspect\nof what it means to be a believer (e.g., Q 2:218, 4:95, 5:35.54, 8:72.74, 9:19). The impression\nthat “contending on God’s path” was a core component of the Medinan community’s col-\nlective identity, or is at least presented as such by the Qur’an, is particularly strengthened\nby five Medinan occurrences of the triad “t hose who believe and emigrate and contend\non God’s path” (alladhīna āmanū wa- hājarū wa- jāhadū fī sabīli llāhi; see, with occasional\nminor variants, Q 2:218, 8:72.74.75, 9:20).8 Other verses also imply a close link between\nbelieving and contending on God’s path (see Q 4:95, placing believers who contend above\nthose who “remain sitting,” and 9:19.44.86.88, 49:15, 61:11).\nWhile Meccan verses clearly envisage contending for the sake of God as a discursive\nactivity, t here are compelling reasons to suppose that the Medinan concept of “contending\non God’s path” hinged on militancy, whose general profile in the Medinan surahs bears con-\nsiderable similarity to late antique Christian notions of militant piety (HCI 192–196). It is\ntrue that some Medinan occurrences of the verb jāhada do not by themselves necessitate an\nassociation with fighting or warfare (see Landau- Tasseron 2003 for a detailed examination).\nNonetheless, several considerations support a general construal of the Medinan notion of\ncontending on God’s path as giving pride of place to a readiness to engage in military action.\nFirst, some verses employing jāhada contain clearly martial language (Landau- Tasseron\n6 Cf. Q 46:17–18, where the roles are inverted: an unbelieving child resists parents who urge him to believe\nin the resurrection. However, this verse does not employ jāhada.\n7 With regard to the compositional structure of Q 29, it is pertinent to observe that the verb jāhada ties\ntogether the surah’s opening panel (where it occurs twice, in vv. 6 and 8) and its final verse, v. 69.\n8 A much more frequent expression is the dyad alladhīna āmanū wa-ʿ amilū l-ṣ āliḥāt, “t hose who believe and\ndo righ teous deeds,” with over fifty occurrences in both Meccan and Medinan surahs (e.g., Q 2:25.82.277, 3:57,\n4:57.122.173, 19:96, 38:24.28). The triad of belief, emigration, and contending may build on the link between belief\nin God and emigration that is implied by the Meccan verse Q 29:26 (on which see HCI 180–181).\njāhada 199", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Moreover, several\npassages employ jāhada in proximity to qātala, “to fight” (Q 2:217.218, 3:142.146, 9:14.16,\n9:81.83; see also 61:4.11), even if the two never occur in the same verse. In addition, the\nprepositional complement fī sabīl allāh, “on God’s path” (or the variant “on his path”),\nwhich is paired with jāhada (or the corresponding participle or verbal noun) in a total of\nfourteen verses, is also very frequently collocated with the verbs qātala and qatala, “to\nkill” (see in more detail under → sabīl and cf. Larcher 2020, 133–135). Fi nally, references to\nthose who “contend by means of their possessions and their lives” (jāhadū bi- amwālihim\nwa- anfusihim; Q 4:95, 8:72, 9:20.41.44.81.88, 49:15, 61:11) confirm that to “contend” was\nto put oneself at considerable risk.9\nThe reconfigured semantics of jāhada in the Medinan surahs reflect the Medinan\nQur’an’s distinctive shift to a more activist understanding of the believers’ role in the\nworld. Rather than being expected to await God’s intervention while bearing testimony\nto his supremacy and oneness, the believers are now charged with the role of enacting\nGod’s punishment of those who repudiate him, such that God’s triumph over the repudi-\nators would arrive “at the hands” of the believers (Q 9:14: bi- aydīkum; HCI 181, 188–189;\nsee also Durie 2018, 58–59, who additionally references Q 2:251). This seminal shift in\nQur’anic theology, it is worth noting, is explic itly acknowledged in Q 4:77: the believers\nwere initially commanded to “restrain” their “hands” (kuffū aydiyakum), and only at a\nsubsequent point in time “was fighting imposed on them” (kutiba ʿalayhimu l- qitālu).10 It\nis true that the final verse of the early Meccan surah Q 26 contains a passing reference to\nmilitant self-h elp when it speaks of those who “believe, do right eous deeds, invoke God\nmuch, and help themselves a fter having been wronged (wa- ntaṣarū min baʿdi mā ẓulimū)”\n(Q 26:227), yet this verse is likely a Medinan addition (Neuwirth 2010, 721–722, and PP\n431–432). The activist stance just described is therefore distinctly Medinan.\nFurther reflections on the Medinan employment of jāhada. The expression qātala fī\nsabīl allāh (“to fight on God’s path”) occurs approximately as frequently as jāhada fī sabīl\nallāh in the Qur’an (about a dozen times).11 Why does the Qur’an not give consistent pref-\nerence to the former phrase, seeing that it signifies fighting and warfare in a much more\nunequivocal fashion? A plausible answer is to conjecture a deliberate concern to pre sent\nMedinan militancy as standing in substantial continuity to the non- militant contending\nof the Meccan period. As we just saw, the Qur’an itself acknowledges that the Medinan\nprescription of fighting was an innovation. At the same time, the Medinan proclamations\ndisplay eforts to soften some of the doctrinal discontinuities that arose a fter the hijrah, by\n9 For a poetic parallel to the frequent bi- amwālihim wa- anfusihim, see DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 20:2 (quoted in\nAHW 142–143), declaring that people’s “lives and possessions” (nufūsuhum wa- amwāluhum) must fade.\n10 For a very dif er ent understanding of Qur’anic militancy, attributing its scriptural expressions to post-\nprophetic warriors whose outlook was at odds with the eschatological piety of Muhammad and his original\nfollowers, see Pohlmann 2018.\n11 The tally is slightly complicated by cases in which qātala and fī sabīl allāh occur in close proximity and\nin the same thematic context but without the prepositional phrase standing in an unequivocal grammatical link\nto the verb (see Q 3:146.195).\n200 jāhada", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Medinan recourse to the notion of contending may be seen as serving the\nsame goal: the newly prescribed duty of religious militancy, rather than being presented as\na fundamental innovation, is cast as merely constituting the circumstantially appropriate\nmanner of living up to e arlier calls for the uncompromising confrontation of religious op-\nposition. A second consideration is that jāhada, given its broader semantic load, is arguably\n“more suited than qātala to playing the role of what one may call a virtue term—t hat is, a\nterm that does not just descriptively specify a certain behaviour, such as qātala, but also\nimplies that the behaviour in question is exemplary and paradigmatic” (HCI 191).\nBoth of the preceding considerations render it unsurprising that the Medinan surahs,\ndespite their tendency to use jāhada in martial contexts, retain traces of a more general\nnotion of “contending” that is not specifically confined to warfare but consists in the con-\nfrontational upholding of Qur’anic doctrine in general. This is most clearly the case in\nQ 22:78, urging the addressees to “contend for God’s sake as behoves him” (wa- jāhidū fī\nllāhi ḥaqqa jihādihi). As has been noted, the passage exhibits no contextual indications\npointing to fighting and warfare (Landau- Tasseron 2003, 38).\nThe principal objective of Medinan militancy: a monot hei stic purging of the Meccan\nsanctuary. What are the concrete aims that the Medinan believers’ militant activism is\nsupposed to realise? Some passages adopt a language of self- defense and just retribution:\nthe believers have been “wronged” (verb: → ẓalama) by having been unjustly expelled\n(verb: akhraja) from their homes merely on account of their faithful mono the ism, and\nGod will now aid them against their unbelieving foes (Q 22:38–40, 60:1). Q 4:75 sum-\nmons the Qur’anic addressees to fight on behalf of oppressed believers who are pleading\nwith God to liberate them from a “town whose inhabitants are wrongdoers” (alladhīna\nyaqūlūna rabbanā akhrijnā min hādhihi l- qaryati l- ẓālimi ahluhā) and who are praying\nfor God to send them protection (see also under → istaḍʿafa). In this apparent allusion\nto believers who had remained b ehind in Mecca, militancy is framed in terms of a sort of\nhumanitarian intervention on behalf of those who are being oppressed and harassed on\naccount of their faith (cf. Q 34:33, briefly discussed u nder → istaḍʿafa). Other passages, by\ncontrast, give more straightforwardly religious and specifically cultic reasons for militancy,\nby suggesting that the associators or repudiators are to be fought until they convert to the\nQur’anic religion (Q 9:5; see also below) or u ntil “all religious worship (→ dīn2) is directed\nat God” (Q 8:39: wa- yakūna l- dīnu kulluhu li-l lāhi; similarly 2:193).12 At the other end of the\nspectrum, one Medinan verse, Q 47:4, is strikingly silent on any ambition of rooting out\npolytheism by force of arms and seems to aim merely for a decisive military defeat of the\nrepudiators, after which any prisoners of war may apparently be released without being\nrequired to change their beliefs or cultic behaviour (see HCI 190 and also u nder → balā).\nIs the demand that the believers are to fight until “all religious worship” is directed at\nGod tantamount to calling for a global military campaign against polytheism, wherever it\nmay rear its head?

This is best read as calling for a takeover of the Meccan\nsanctuary, the “sacred place of prostration” (al- masjid al-ḥ arām; see under → ḥarrama),\nwhich is mentioned immediately afterwards in the same verse and to which the believers\nare repeatedly said to have been denied access (Q 2:217, 5:2, 22:25, 8:34, 48:25). Regarding\nthe other of the two verses about ensuring universal worship of God alone, Q 8:39, too, it\nis clear that the specific opponents to be fought are “the repudiators” (alladhīna kafarū),\nwho are mentioned immediately before in v. 38 and who are generally quite a specific group\nin the Qur’an, namely, the pagan inhabitants of Mecca who had previously ousted the\nQur’anic believers (see under → kafara). Fi nally, the notion that the believers are bidden\nto engage in a global mono the istic campaign would seem to be explic itly disavowed by\na verse towards the end of Surah 9, which calls upon the believers to “fight those of the\nrepudiators who are near you” (Q 9:123: qātilū lladhīna yalūnakum mina l- kuffāri).\nThe Qur’anic corpus documents that the goal of conquering the “sacred place of pros-\ntration” was eventually realised: according to Q 9:17–19.28 (on which see under → ʿamara\nand also → ṭahara), the Qur’anic believers’ “associating” or “repudiating” opponents are\ndivested from control over the “sacred place of prostration” and are henceforth forbid-\nden to approach it. In implementing this commandment, the Qur’anic believers led by\nMuhammad can be seen as re- enacting God’s commandment to Abraham to ensure the\npurity (verb: ṭahhara) of God’s “house” (→ bayt), as recounted in Q 2:125 and 22:26 (see\nunder → ṭahara). This nexus is further tightened by the fact that Q 9:28 justifies the ban\non associators approaching the sacred place of prostration by saying that they are “filth”\n(najas), while 5:90 and 22:30 inveigh against the “impurity” (rijs; see u nder → rijz) of pagan\nritual; the meta phorical evocation of impurity here complements the use of ṭahhara, “to\npurify,” in Q 2:125 and 22:26.\nNow, given the predominant preoccupation with the Meccan sanctuary that emerges\nfrom the preceding material, it is by no means improbable that the contextually primary\npoint of Q 2:193 and 8:39’s call for religious worship (dīn), or for all religious worship, to\nbe directed at God is to urge a mono the istic purge specifically of the Kaʿbah cult rather\nthan to mandate a global mono the istic campaign.13 One way of rationalising the explic itly\nuniversal language employed especially in Q 8:39 (wa- yakūna l- dīnu kulluhu li-l lāhi) would\nbe to speculate that the Qur’anic addressees were well aware that the Meccan sanctuary\nwas an archaic polytheistic island holding out against a regional environment in which\ndif er ent forms of mono the ism were increasingly the norm. A mono the istic purge of the\nMeccan sanctuary may therefore have been understood to be a crucial final push in en-\nsuring a global dominance of at least a nominal kind of mono the ism in the Qur’an’s wider\nworld (even if the Qur’an’s repeated criticism of Jews and Christian makes it clear that\nMuhammad and his followers w ere quite dissatisfied with certain cont emporary manifes-\ntations of mono the ism).\n13 This particularising way is how Q 2:193 and 8:39 are understood in Abdel Haleem 2010, 21–22 and 112.\nAbdel Haleem provides virtually no argument for this interpretation and I have accordingly criticised it in HCI\n210, n. 10. However, in light of the material surveyed in the main text I would now consider his reading of the\ntwo verses u nder discussion to be much more defensible. Still, I continue to hold that it is inaccurate to deny that\nsome Qur’anic passages do envisage conversion by force of arms (against Abdel Haleem 1999, 61).\n202 jāhada", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

That Mecca was to be seized and that worship at God’s “house” there\nwas to be reformed by force is clear enough; but t here is l ittle Qur’anic evidence for any\nterritorial claims beyond this, apart from a fairly obscure allusion in Q 33:27 that promises\nthe Qur’anic believers possession of “land” or “a land” that “youp have not yet trodden” (see\nin more detail the final section u nder → arḍ). In par tic ul ar, t here is no explicit Qur’anic war-\nrant for a program of conquest of the Holy Land and of further regions outside the Arabian\nPeninsula, that is, for the campaigns into Byzantine and Sasanian territories that put the\nearly Muslims in control of large swathes of the M iddle East within a dec ade of Muhammad’s\ndeath. This fact remains a significant challenge for any attempt to date substantial parts of the\nQur’an to the age of the Arab conquests (Sinai 2014, 515–516). Th ere is, however, one verse\nin a Medinan surah, Q 9:29, that does foreshadow the tribute-b ased structure of the early\npost- Qur’anic Arab state, made up of an elite of tribal warriors who extracted taxes from a\nsubject population comprising large numbers of fellow mono thei sts. This verse therefore\nmerits a closer look in the next and final section of the entry.\nQ 9:29 and the injunction to exact tribute (jizyah) from subjugated scripture-\nowners. According to Q 9:29, the Qur’anic addressees are to fight (verb: qātala) “ those\nwho do not believe in God and in the final day, do not deem forbidden what God and his\nMessenger have declared to be forbidden, and do not adhere to the true religion, from\namong t hose who w ere given the scripture (mina lladhīna ūtū l- kitāba), u ntil they humbly\ngive tributary compensation (al-j izyah) without re sis tance (ʿan yadin).”14 “ Those who\nwere given the scripture” must be equivalent to the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb),\na standard Medinan periphrasis for Jews and Christians. Presumably, defeated Jews and\nChristians whose beliefs and practices w ere deemed objectionable in light of Qur’anic\nteachings w ere expected to pay tribute in return for their lives and possessions being spared\nand for not being restricted in their religious beliefs and practices in line with Qur’anic\nnorms. In this regard, the treatment of unbelieving Jews and Christians that is mandated\nby Q 9:29 difers quite markedly from that of the pagan associators, who according to 9:5\nwill only remain unmolested if they repent, perform prayer, and give the zakāh— efectively\na metonymy for full conversion to the Qur’anic religion. The verses following Q 9:29, vv.\n30–33, then provide further detail about the allegedly unacceptable Jewish and Christian\ndoctrines and institutions that motivate the verdict of unbelief in v. 29, such as the ac-\ncusation that Christians illicitly deify Jesus (see further under → ashraka, → al-n aṣārā,\nand → al- yahūd).\nQ 9:29 follows in a somewhat abrupt manner on the ban on any pagan presence in\nMecca in the preceding verse (Q 9:28), and some scholars have surmised the pre sent\n14 The enigmatic expression ḥattā yuʿṭū l- jizyata ʿan yadin wa-h um ṣāghirūn has attracted much scholarly\nattention.

Bravmann argues for the\ntranslation “ until they give the reward due for a benefaction (since their lives are spared), while they are igno-\nminious (namely, for not having fought unto death)” (Bravmann 1972, 199; italics in the original). As for jizyah,\nJefery proposes to derive it from Aramaic gzītā (FVQ 101–102), which is attested both in Syriac and in Jewish\nBabylonian Aramaic in the sense of “tax, tribute” (SL 225 and DJBA 275). Pahlavi has gzytk'/gazīdag (MacKenzie\n1971, 36). Whatever the ultimate provenance, it is likely that Qur’anic jizyah would at least in part have been\ngoverned by the sense of compensation that generally adheres to the Arabic root j- z- y. My rendering “tributary\ncompensation” aims to capture this interplay.\njāhada 203", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Bell nonetheless places the verse in the context of Muhammad’s\ncareer. This is certainly not implausible. A fter all, post- Qur’anic Islamic sources report\nthat Muhammad himself led an expedition against the Jewish oasis of Khaybar and that he\npermitted its inhabitants to remain on the land in return for tributary payments (Veccia\nVaglieri 1978 and Munt 2021). Muhammad is also reported to have sent or led campaigns\nagainst Muʾtah and Tabūk in northwestern Arabia, bringing him into direct conflict with\nByzantine forces (e.g., Buhl 1993; Blair 2000; Hoyland 2015, 38, 39). While it is no concern\nof the pre sent discussion to determine the historical accuracy of these accounts, there is\ncertainly nothing generally unlikely or anachronistic about them, and such expansionist\nprobings northwards would have continued e arlier cases of Arab raiding inside Byzantine\nterritory (Hoyland 2015, 41). All of this would provide a reasonable context for Q 9:29\nduring the lifetime of Muhammad.\nAt the same time, it is undeniable that Q 9:29 resonates in an unusually clear fashion\nwith what one may assume to have been an overriding concern of the post- Qur’anic Arab\nconquerors, namely, to justify why they deserved to rule over and be funded by a subject\npopulation encompassing many Christians and Jews, whose status as legitimate targets of\nwarfare was not necessarily entailed by Medinan injunctions to fight the pagan associators.\nThe answer that Q 9:29 provides is that many Jews and Christians do not in fact qualify as\nproperly believing in God, rendering it justifiable to combat them like the associators or\nrepudiators discussed in preceding verses of Surah 9. But Q 9:29 also intimates that vis-\nà- vis Jews and Christians, unlike vis- à- vis the associators, it is not the Qur’anic believers’\nresponsibility to ensure full conformity with Qur’anic norms and that tributary subjuga-\ntion, rather than full conversion, is sufficient. Thus, Q 9:29 is the rare case of a Qur’anic\nstatement that may be viewed as addressing, in a relatively straightforward manner, what\nmust have been a pressing concern of the conquest period. Scholars prepared to entertain\nthe hypothesis of conquest- age additions to the Islamic scripture may accordingly find it\nattractive to posit that the current shape of Q 9:29 is a result of post-p rophetic insertion\nor at least revision.15 Nonetheless, in line with what was said above, t here is no compelling\nreason to suppose that Q 9:29 could not date to the lifetime of Muhammad. The verse\ndoes not, for instance, stand out from the rest of the Qur’an on terminological grounds;\nthe fact that it envisages the existence of scripture- owners who do not live up to Qur’anic\nstandards of proper belief is paralleled by other Medinan passages that mention repudiating\nscripturalists (Q 2:105, 59:2.11, and 98:1.6; see also under → kafara).\nOverall, what is most impor tant about Q 9:29 and also 33:27 (discussed u nder → arḍ) is\nthe fact that these two verses highlight all the more starkly the absence of further material\nin the Qur’an confirming that the Medinan call for militant “contending on God’s path”\naimed at a program of substantial conquest beyond the Meccan sanctuary, and in par tic ul ar\nat expansion into the Holy Land (see also n. 27 u nder → arḍ). Hence, the Arab conquerors’\nproj ect of subjugating and exacting tribute from an agriculturalist mono the istic population\nof the sort encountered in Byzantine Palestine, while resonant with Q 9:29 and 33:27, has\nonly a weak scriptural foundation. It is, moreover, hardly in strict accordance with the\nappeal in Q 9:123, quoted above, that the believers are to “fight t hose of the repudiators\n15 The entry on → bayyana explores the hypothesis that Q 3:7 may be a post- prophetic addition, but limits\nitself to dating it within the first de cade or so of Muhammad’s demise.\n204 jāhada", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In any case, the preceding discussion makes it\nclear that even a fter the Medinan surahs introduced a militant notion of “contending on\nGod’s path,” expansion to the north did not form a major plank of Muhammad’s prophetic\nmessage (as opposed to a contingent opportunity that temptingly presented itself in view\nof Byzantine disarray due to Heraclius’s protracted war against the Sasanians).\njahannam | hell\nFurther vocabulary discussed: dīn | judgement nār | fire, hell- fire jaḥīm | blaze\nsaʿīr | blaze s aqar | the scorching ṣaliya tr. | to roast in s.th. w aqūd | fuel wajh |\nface\nThe Qur’anic nomenclature for hell. On the day of God’s eschatological judgement\n(→ dīn1), the resurrected w ill either be rewarded with the perpetual delights of paradise\nor punished with eternal torment (see under → ajr, → jannah, → khalada, → ʿadhdhaba).\nSimilar to the Jewish and Christian traditions, the Qur’an’s prevalent terminology for dam-\nnation is related to fire and combustion (see generally O’Shaughnessy 1961 and Gwynne\n2002). Thus, from the early Meccan to the Medinan period, well over a hundred Qu’anic\nverses speak of the “fire” (nār) of hell (e.g., Q 2:24.39.80 e tc., 3:10.16.24 e tc., 87:12, 90:20,\n92:14, 101:11, 104:6).1 A smaller number of passages mention the “blaze” of hell, corre-\nsponding to the Arabic words jaḥīm (e.g., Q 2:119, 5:10.86, 26:91, 81:12, 82:14, 83:16, 102:6;\nsee O’Shaughnessy 1961, 451–455, though with a highly speculative etymology) and saʿīr\n(e.g., Q 4:10.55, 67:5.10–11, 76:4, 84:12; O’Shaughnessy 1961, 455–457),2 or, in the Medinan\nsurahs, to “the punishment of burning” (adhāb al-ḥ arīq; e.g., Q 3:181; see also u nder → ʿadh-\ndhaba). Apart from these and other pyromorphous designations of hell, such as saqar,\n“the scorching” (Q 54:48, 74:26.27.42),3 hell is in seventy- six cases— again encompassing\nall periods of the Qur’an’s genesis— called jahannam, a noun treated as feminine (e.g.,\nQ 2:206, 3:12.162.197, 50:30, 52:13, 55:43, 72:15.23, 78:21, 85:10, 89:23).4\n1 Use of the word nār to refer to an ordinary fire is rare but not absent from the Qur’anic corpus (e.g., Q 2:17,\n3:183, 5:64, 20:10), but most of its Qur’anic occurrences refer to the fire of hell.\n2 For an exceptional case in which al- jaḥīm is not applied to the fire of hell but rather to the pyre on which\nAbraham’s opponents seek to burn him, see Q 37:97. It is pos si ble that the word underlines the hybris of Abra-\nham’s foes, who arrogate to themselves the right to inflict a punishment that ought to be a divine prerogative.\n3 Unlike al- nār, al- jaḥīm, and al- saʿīr, none of the four occurrences of saqar has the definite article. This,\nand prob ably also the fact that Q 74:28–30 treat it as feminine, which is unusual for a verbal noun of the morpho-\nlogical pattern faʿalun (e.g., ʿamal, harab, ṭalab), endow saqar with the character of an enigmatic proper name.\n4 O’Shaughnessy 1961, 457–458, posits that occurrences of jahannam in early Meccan surahs are all later\ninterpolations, relying in part on Bell, but this claim is very doubtful.

The “Valley\nof Hinnom” or “Valley of the Son/Sons of Hinnom” (e.g., 2 Kgs 23:10) was originally a\nsite of human sacrifice in Jerusalem, which apocalyptic texts and in their wake the New\nTestament (e.g., Matt 5:22.29–30, 10:28, 18:9, 23:15.33; Mark 9:43–47) transformed into a\nstandard name for the place of the sinners’ eschatological torment (see generally TDNT\n1:657–658). While the Syriac and also the Greek form geenna lack the final m appearing in\nArabic jahannam, this does not apply to the Ethiopic form gahannam, which may accord-\ningly well have been the immediate ancestor of the Arabic word (NB 47; FVQ 106). The\ngenitive construct nār jahannam, “the fire of hell,” which appears several times in Surah 9\n(9:35.63.68.81.109) and in a few other places (Q 35:36, 52:13, 72:23, 98:6), parallels a similar\ncombination of both nouns in the New Testament (Matt 5:22 and 18:9: eis tēn geennan\ntou pyros, “into the Gehenna of fire”) and the Talmud (b. B. Mәṣ. 85a: nura d-g ehinnam,\n“the fire of Gehenna”). Given the repeated concatenation of nār and jahannam (cf. also\nQ 40:49), it can prob ably be assumed that Arabic jahannam connoted a place of eternal\ntorment in which fire plays a paramount role. If that is so, then the word jahannam, too,\nforms part of the Qur’an’s predominantly pyromorphous nomenclature for hell.\nSome aspects of hell in the Qur’an. As the terminology just reviewed indicates, com-\nbustion and conflagration are prominent and vivid features of the Qur’anic portrayal of\ndamnation, a state of afairs well exemplified already by the description of the flames of\nhell engulfing the sinners in the early Meccan passage Q 104:4–9. The details given are\nconsistently gruesome: the evildoers will perpetually “roast in” (ṣaliya + acc., never in the\nsuffix conjugation) hell- fire (e.g., Q 4:10, 14:29, 17:18, 36:64, 37:163, 92:15, 111:3),5 they w ill\nform its “fuel” (waqūd; Q 2:24, 3:10, 66:6, 85:5), and “whenever their skins are cooked we\nwill give them other skins” (Q 4:56). Hell is thus envisaged as a pro cess of total annihila-\ntion that never attains its natu ral consummation and is instead perpetually prolonged: the\ndenizens of hell “ will not be finished of and die” (35:36), despite begging to be disposed\nof for good (Q 43:77; cf. 69:27), and they w ill “neither die in it [namely, in hell] nor live”\n(Q 20:74, 87:13).\nContinuing on from scenes of eschatological judgement that describe the blackened,\ndismal, or disgraced faces (singular: wajh) of the condemned on the day of resurrection\n(e.g., Q 3:106, 17:97, 39:60, 67:27, 75:24, 80:40, 88:2; see also the remarks on God’s face\nunder → allāh), faces are a par tic u lar focus of torment in hell: the convicts’ faces will be\nthrown headlong into the fire (Q 27:90), they will be dragged through the fire on their\nfaces (Q 54:48), their faces will be turned over in the fire (Q 33:66), the fire scorching\nthe sinners’ faces will cause them to bare their teeth in a tortured grin (Q 23:104), and\nwhen the wrongdoers call out for help their faces will be scalded with boiling water “like\nmolten brass” (Q 18:29).6 Apart from the pain involved, disfigurement of the face in hell\nencapsulates the sinners’ utter humiliation (see similarly O’Shaughnessy 1961, 459–460).\nThis contrasts with the honours that are bestowed on the blessed (e.g., Q 37:42; see also\n5 See also the ditransitive derivatives from the same root, ṣallā and aṣlā + acc. + acc., “to roast s.o. in s.th.,”\nin Q 69:31 and in 4:30.56.115, 74:26.\n6 See additionally Q 25:34.\n206 jahannam", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Apart from chains and fetters (Q 13:5,\n14:49, 34:33, 36:8, 40:71, 73:12, 76:4) and shirts of pitch (Q 14:50; see FVQ 241–242),\nculinary tortures stand out: those convicted to hell will be forced to fill their bellies with\nthe fruit of the nightmarish → zaqqūm or “ingurgitation” tree (Q 37:62–66, 44:43–46,\n56:52–53) and to drink scalding w ater (Q 6:70, 10:4, 37:67, 38:57, 47:15, 56:54). This depic-\ntion of hell in the form of a macabre banquet—perhaps an echo of Zoroastrian eschatology\n(Bitsch, forthcoming)—inverts the situation in paradise, which is frequently portrayed as\na divinely sponsored feast to which the blessed are invited as esteemed guests (→ jannah).\nHell also has a social, or more properly antisocial, aspect, in so far as its terrors will erase all\ninterpersonal solidarity: whereas the blessed in paradise will be fraternally devoid of any\nrancour (Q 7:43, 15:47; → jannah), the inmates of hell w ill curse, blame, and quarrel with\none another and call down even harsher punishment on their fellow convicts (Q 7:38–39,\n26:96, 29:25, 33:67–68, 38:61, 40:47, 41:29; see Gwynne 2002, 416).

Arabic\nḥajj; see Al- Jallad 2015a, 322, and Al- Jallad 2022, 41–44). The verb ḥgg is also found, in the\nsame sense, in Dadanitic (e.g., Hidalgo- Chacón Díez 2016, 73 and 76). Sabaic, too, has the\nverb ḥgg, “to perform a pilgrimage,” and the corresponding noun (Beeston et al. 1982, 66;\nMaraqten 2021, 434). Ceremonial visits to sanctuaries— perhaps undertaken at times of\nseasonal change (Al- Jallad 2022, 42–43)—t hus formed part of the range of religious cere-\nmonies known and performed in the Qur’an’s Arabian environment. A mainly Aramaic\ninscription in Nabataeo-A rabic script, UJadhNab 538, is dated to Passover (ḥg ʾl- pṭyr) of the\nyear corresponding to 303 CE (Nehmé 2018, 185–186); the Arabic phrase ḥg ʾl- pṭyr shows\nthat Arabic ḥajj (or ḥijj), though not a loanword, could also be used as an equivalent of\nHebrew ḥag, “festival.”\nFor more concrete insights into the ḥajj ritual presupposed by the Qur’an, we are largely\ndependent on extra- Qur’anic traditions relayed by Muslim authors rather than being able\nto rely on archaeological data.

Beginning on the ninth day of the month of Dhū\nl-Ḥ ijjah, it revolved around a type of pro cession departing from the plain of Mount ʿArafah\nor ʿArafāt (Rubin 2009a; Chabbi 2020, 358–360), located to the east of Mecca outside the sa-\ncred precinct or ḥaram (see u nder → ḥarrama), and leading via al-M uzdalifah to Minā (RAH\n79–84; Wensinck et al. 1971; Chabbi 2020, 357–371; Ammann 2001, 21–25). Subsequent to\na ritual “standing” (wuqūf) on the plateau of ʿArafah until sunset, pilgrims embarked on a\ndownhill “run” or “pouring forth” (ifāḍah) to al-M uzdalifah. At sunrise, following a further\nwuqūf, celebrants continued on another ifāḍah to Minā, where they performed a stone-\nthrowing ritual and animal sacrifices. After having their heads shaven, participants in the\nḥajj re- entered profane life and spent the following days feasting at Minā.\nWith minor modifications, the basic structure of the pre-I slamic ḥajj was taken over\nby Islam. Yet despite such continuity at the level of ritual behaviour, the original pagan\nsignificance of the ḥajj rituals is not clearly stated by Islamic sources. We are consequently\nreduced to etiological speculation. The most plausible conjecture is that the ḥajj, which\nmay originally have been held in the early autumn (RAH 94–101), marked the end of\nthe summer season and served to anticipate or ensure hibernal rainfall. Broadly seasonal\nunderstandings of the ḥajj are already current in older scholarship, such as the proposal\nthat the initial ifāḍah from ʿArafah constituted a “persecution of the d ying sun” while the\nvigil at al-M udalifah was meant to call forth the thunder- god Quzaḥ, who may have been\nbelieved to reside atop a nearby mountain by the same name (Wensinck et al. 1971, 32).\nThe most compelling attempt at reconstructing the erstwhile significance of the ḥajj as a\n“ritual of demanding rainfall” (Chabbi 2020, 358) is Jacqueline Chabbi’s. She proposes that\nthe wuqūf, an act of self- exposure to the searing sun, aimed to propitiate the sun- goddess\nto permit abundant precipitation, while the double ifāḍah from ʿArafah and then from al-\nMuzdalifah, leading down a canyon, was an anticipatory imitation of the hoped- for floods\n(see Chabbi 2020, 361–365). As she notes, the root f- y-ḍ , under lying the noun ifāḍah, is\nassociated with flooding and spilling over.\nAccording to Wellhausen, the pre- Qur’anic ḥajj did not involve Mecca or the Kaʿbah\nsanctuary (RAH 79–84, restated in Crone 1987, 172–176; see also Chabbi 2020, 364 and\n368): even though the Islamic ḥajj begins in Mecca and includes a final circumambulation\nof the Kaʿbah a fter the sacrifice at Minā, both visits to the Meccan sanctuary may well have\nbeen “added to an originally in de pen dent ritual” (Crone 1987, 174). Wellhausen considers\nthese secondary supplements of the original ḥajj ritual, designed to make the ḥajj “an ap-\npendix to the cult of the Kaʿbah” (RAH 83), to be Islamic. Qur’anic statements linking the\nḥajj and the Kaʿbah w ill be considered in the next section; but it may be noted h ere that\na pre- Islamic drift towards linking the ḥajj with the Meccan sanctuary is already manifest\nin extra- Qur’anic reports about a tribal association known as the ḥums, who included\nQuraysh. Apart from adhering to distinctive taboos while in the state of ritual consecra-\ntion that pilgrims were required to observe during the ḥajj, the ḥums—u nlike other tribes\nknown as ḥillah— remained inside the Meccan ḥaram during the ḥajj and boycotted the\nwuqūf of ʿArafāt, instead performing it at al-M uzdalifah (Ammann 2001, 23–25; see also\nRAH 85–86; Kister 1965, 131–141; Rubin 1982, 255–256; Rubin 1986, 125–127). Such reports\nsuggest that a tendency to sideline ʿArafāt in the interest of augmenting the religious pres-\ntige of the Meccan ḥaram was already pre sent prior to the Qur’an.\nBesides the ḥajj, there was also a pilgrimage ritual proper to the Meccan “house,”\nnamely the ʿumrah, literally a ritual “visit” to, or “stay” at, the Kaʿbah (see below and\nḥajja 209", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:232", "title": "Page 232", "locator": "pdf_page:232", "text": "under → ʿamara). Mostly based on early Islamic testimonies, Wellhausen maintains that\nthe pre- Islamic ʿumrah pilgrimage was chiefly associated with the month of Rajab, the prin-\ncipal sacred month of the ancient Arabian (or Meccan) calendar (RAH 78–79, 84, 98–100).\nThe Qur’anic data. The Qur’an unequivocally associates the ḥajj with Allāh and gives\nno hints that it might originally have had a seasonal significance or have been linked with\nsome other deity. According to Q 2:196, both the ḥajj and the ʿumrah are to be performed\n“for God” (li- llāhi). Similarly, Q 3:97 asserts that “pilgrimage to the h ouse is an obligation\nthat p eople owe to God” (li- llāhi ʿalā l- nāsi ḥijju l- bayti), while Q 22:27 has God commission\nAbraham to convoke people for the ḥajj. In tandem with this pre sen ta tion of the ḥajj as a\nhuman obligation towards God, however, the Qur’an also stresses that the ḥajj involves\n“benefits” (manāfiʿ, singular: manfaʿ) for its human participants (Q 22:28.33). The institu-\ntion of the pilgrimage thus fits into the general Qur’anic conviction that the world created\nby God operates in a way that is generously geared to maximising human advantage and\ncon ve nience (see under → nafaʿa).1\nWhen it comes to concrete ritual detail, the Qur’an alludes only to a few aspects of the\nḥajj ritual described in the previous section (see in more detail under → ḥarrama as well\nas the overview of the relevant Qur’anic data in Firestone 1991, 373–377, and Hawting\n2004). For example, Q 2:198–199 refer to the per for mance of the ifāḍah from ʿArafāt and\ncommand the audience to invoke God at a place called “the sacred place of ritual” (al-\nmashʿar al- ḥarām), conventionally identified with al- Muzdalifah. An earlier verse in the\nsame surah, Q 2:158, gives licence to “t hose who perform the ḥajj to the h ouse or under-\ntake a cultic visitation [of it]” (man hajja l-b ayta awi ʿtamara)2 to circumambulate al- Ṣafā\nand al- Marwah, two sites in the vicinity of the Kaʿbah (fa- lā junāḥa ʿalayhi an yaṭṭawwafa\nbihimā). The general impression arising from such allusions is that the Qur’an presupposes\nexisting pilgrimage rites and that its express pronouncements on the topic are limited to\nendorsing or modifying these existing practices in specific re spects.\nInterestingly, both Q 3:97 (cited in the preceding paragraph) and 2:158 assume that\nit is God’s “house” (→ bayt) in Mecca that formed the focal point of the ḥajj (or ḥijj)\nrituals (Q 2:158: man ḥajja l-b ayta; 3:97: ḥijj al-b ayt; see also Hawting 2019, 99–101). A\nverse group in Surah 22 implies that this nexus dates back as far as Abraham, whom God\ncommissioned to “purify” his “house” (Q 22:26) and to convene the ḥajj (Q 22:27–29),\nwhich is to be concluded by circumambulating (verb: taṭawwafa bi- ) the “house” (v. 29).\nAlthough assessment of the issue is inevitably subjective, in none of these three places\ndoes the Qur’anic text come across as needing to pre sent an extended or polemically\nsharpened argument in support of the point that the ḥajj is in fact centred on the Meccan\n“house.” Hence, if the incorporation of the Kaʿbah into the ḥajj ritual is indeed a secondary\nexpansion of a ritual that was originally conducted entirely outside Mecca, this expansion\ncould well predate the Qur’an, contrary to Wellhausen’s opinion. That the Qur’an pre-\nsupposes, rather than introduces, a connection between the ḥajj and the Kaʿbah is also\nsupported by the fact that Q 2:196 instructs those wishing to combine the ḥajj with the\nʿumrah, with an intervening interruption of the state of consecration required for both\nrituals (fa-m an tamattaʿa bi-l - ʿumrati ilā l- ḥajji), to perform a compensatory sacrifice or\n1 For a couplet from the dīwān of ʿAmr ibn Qamīʾah that similarly connects the term ḥajj with the root n- f-ʿ ,\nsee Lyall 1919, no. 2:9–10 (cited under → dīn2).\n2 On iʿtamara, see under → ʿamara.\n210 ḥajja", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This implies not only that per for mance of the ʿumrah was not limited to the month\nof Rajab and had come to be severed from a specific seasonal anchorage; it also takes\nfor granted that ḥajj pilgrims might wish to perform rituals in the vicinity of the Kaʿbah,\nin line with the command in Q 22:29 to end the ḥajj by circumambulating the Meccan\nsanctuary. This could indicate that by the time of the Qur’an the ḥajj ceremonies held at\nʿArafāt, al-M uzdalifah, and Minā had already begun to fuse with worship at the intramural\nMeccan sanctuary.\nAllāh as the Lord of the pre- Islamic ḥajj. If indeed it was already prior to the Qur’an\nthat per for mance of the ḥajj began to coalesce with worship at the Kaʿbah, this could have\nled at least some participants in the ḥajj to reinterpret it as directed at Allāh, the patron\ndeity of the Meccan sanctuary. As we saw above, the Qur’an certainly takes the view that\nthe ḥajj is part of the cult of Allāh, and the relevant verses are consistent (although not\nexclusively so) with the conjecture that an understanding of the ḥajj as directed at Allāh\npredates them. There is, furthermore, some poetic support for this hypothesis (Sinai 2019b,\n53). First, al- Aʿshā swears “by the Lord of the [sacrificial] animals dancing t owards Minā”\n(Ḥusayn 1983, no. 15:30), and subsequent verses make it clear that the lord in question is\nin fact Allāh or “the Merciful.” Secondly, a poem attributed to ʿAwf ibn al- Aḥwaṣ swears\n“by him to whose sacred sites the Quraysh perform the ḥajj (wa- lladhī ḥajjat qurayshun\nmaḥārimahu), and by that which Ḥirāʾ gathers together” (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 35:4; see also\nKister 1965, 139). It seems likely that this oath, too, intends Allāh.3 Of course, the verses\njust quoted do not entail that there was a general consensus to the efect that the ḥajj rites\nwere devoted to Allāh: just as the distinction between the ḥums and ḥillah tribes indicates\na degree of ritual diversity, so dif er ent groups of ḥajj celebrants could have held dif er ent\nbeliefs about the primary deity involved.4\nḥijr | prohibited, taboo\n→ ḥarrama\nḥadīth | discourse\n→ dhālika, → sūrah\nḥudūd allāh pl. | God’s bound aries\n→ dhālika, → ẓalama\n3 The second part of the verse may refer to pilgrims, oferings, or sacrifices, and it implies that Mount Ḥirāʾ—\nwhich does not form part of the Islamic pilgrimage route— counted as a pre-I slamic sacred site that ḥajj pilgrims\nvisited in addition to ʿArafāt, al- Muzdalifah, Minā, and the Kaʿbah itself.\n4 An additional consideration is that the seasonal significance that putatively defined the original signifi-\ncance of the ḥajj could well have faded from consciousness by the time of the Qur’an’s emergence if we accept\nthe customary assumption that the pre- Islamic Meccan lunar calendar was not reliably synchronised with the\nsolar year (RAH 94–101). If this is correct, then a tendency to associate the ḥajj with Allāh would have provided\na ready alternative to its erstwhile seasonal significance. However, a recent attempt at reconstructing the pre-\nIslamic Meccan calendar posits that synchronisation of the lunar months with the solar year was in fact carried\nout “regularly and correctly” up until the hijrah (de Blois 2021, 204 and 207).\nḥudūd allāh 211", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:235", "title": "Page 235", "locator": "pdf_page:235", "text": "Overview. There are two Qur’anic roots, ḥ- r- m and q- d- s, that map onto aspects of the\nrich tangle of notions conveyed by the words “sacred” and “holy” (on which see gener-\nally Oxtoby 2005, 4097–4100).1 Derivatives of q-d -s , which are analysed in more detail\nunder → qaddasa, are relatively infrequent, being l imited to ten verses overall; they are\nconfined to contexts discernibly connected with the Biblical tradition. By way of an approx-\nimation, derivatives of q- d- s may be said to express holiness in Rudolf Otto’s sense of the\nnuminous, awe-i nspiring quality of the divine (Otto 2014), which in a secondary manner\nalso devolves upon entities and phenomena closely associated with God, such as the venue\nof his revelatory address of Moses (Q 20:12, 79:16: bi- l- wādi l- muqaddasi ṭuwā).\nBy contrast, the root ḥ- r- m has a larger presence in the Qur’anic corpus, appearing in\nseventy- one verses. Since its derivatives are sometimes used in explicit connection with\npagan rituals, it stands to reason that they served to articulate indigenous ideas of the\nsacred in pre- Islamic Arabia (Durie 2018, 180–182). This supposition accords with the\nlong- standing use of ḥ- r- m in Sabaic epigraphy, where derivatives of the root may refer\nto a sanctuary (ḥrmt) or express the placement of settlements or persons under a ban of\nannihilation.2 When the Qur’an employs derivatives of ḥ-r -m — especially the adjective\nḥarām—in a way that is appropriately translatable as “sacred” or the like (cf. Munt 2014,\n25–26), the operative idea of the sacred is close to the Durkheimian understanding of\n“sacred things” as entities and phenomena whose extraordinary status is marked out and\nmaintained in so far as they are “set apart” (séparées) and “forbidden” (interdites) in\nconsequence of certain communal beliefs and practices (Durkheim 1912, 65): “sacred\nthings are those that are protected and isolated by interdictions” (Durkheim 1912, 56;\nfor a valuable clarification of the concept of the sacred, see Evans 2003). To be ḥarām,\nin its native Arabian sense, is to be surrounded and regulated by taboos, as already\nnoted by Izutsu (ERCQ 237). This is the sense in which the Qur’an applies the adjective\nḥarām to the Meccan sanctuary, as discussed in more detail below. It is impor tant to add,\nhowever, that several verses (Q 5:97, 27:91, 28:57, 29:67; cf. 14:37) make it clear that the\nsacredness of Mecca is grounded in nothing more than an act of divine designation: God\nhas conferred upon the Kaʿbah a special status by virtue of which humans are bidden, on\npain of punishment, to observe vario us taboos in their interactions with it. Some currents\nin later Muslim thought attribute to the Kaʿbah an immanent sacredness, for instance, by\ncasting it as the world’s navel (O’Meara 2020). The Qur’an, by contrast, does not explic itly\nderive the Kaʿbah’s sacredness from any intrinsic quality or any power objectively pre sent\nin it; rather, its sacredness is merely a consequence of an act of positive divine stipulation.\nIn this sense, the Qur’anic distinction between sacred (in the sense of ḥarām) and profane\nis exclusively dependent on the legislative w ill of a transcendent deity, not on any qualita-\ntive distinctions inhering in the world as such. This links up with the Qur’anic insistence\nthat God’s creative activity may be ubiquitously and homogeneously encountered in a\nwide range of natur al pro cesses and even in the world’s basic per sis tence in being (see\nunder → āyah and → khalaqa).\n1 On a third root expressing the general idea of sanctity, b- r- k, see u nder → arḍ, → bayt, → ism, and → qad-\ndasa (commenting on the verbs bāraka and tabāraka).\n2 See the sources and secondary lit er a ture that can be found on the root ḥ- r- m at http:// sabaweb . uni - jena\n. de / Sabaweb / (accessed 8 December 2021).\nḥarrama 213", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:236", "title": "Page 236", "locator": "pdf_page:236", "text": "It is consistent with the preceding that many Qur’anic occurrences of the root ḥ- r- m do\nnot have special connotations of sacrality and simply refer to divinely imposed prohibi-\ntions. As just intimated, the Qur’anic God is a legislator along the lines of the Biblical one,\na deity who commands, permits, and forbids. For example, according to Q 6:151, the t hings\nproscribed by God include worshipping beings other than him, killing one’s children, and\n“abominable deeds” (al- fawāḥish), designating most likely unspecified sexual abominations\n(CDKA 209). Th ese prohibitions do not serve to ensure the sacred status of some par tic u-\nlar place, time, or activity like the Meccan sanctuary or the pilgrimage rituals performed\nthere: they simply identify acts that are illicit and for which humans will incur divine\npunishment.3 Divine prohibitions, as well as human assumptions about what is subject to\nthem, are expressed by the second-f orm verb ḥarrama, “to declare s.th. to be forbidden,\nto regard s.th. as forbidden.” This verb w ill be treated in some detail a fter a discussion of\nthe two principal entities or phenomena to which the Qur’an applies the adjective ḥarām,\nnamely, the Meccan sanctuary and a number of “sacred months.”\nThe “sacred place of prostration” (al- masjid al-ḥ arām). Of the seventy- one Qur’anic\nverses containing the root ḥ- r- m, twenty-fi ve employ the singular adjective ḥarām or its\nplural ḥurum, sometimes together with other derivatives of ḥ- r- m. In accordance with what\nhas just been said, the word ḥarām is normally translatable as “inviolable, sacred,” in the\nsense of being subject to and regulated by special prohibitions. Its opposite is ḥalāl (Q 10:59,\n16:116) or ḥill (Q 3:93; see also 5:5 and 60:10), “permitted.” In Q 5:1.95.96 the plural ḥurum\nis applied to persons and signifies being in a state of ritual consecration (see below), but\nthis too is easily reducible to a general sense of ḥarām as governed by special prohibitions.\nMore problematic is Q 21:95, which in the Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim reading runs wa-ḥ arāmun ʿalā\nqaryatin ahlaknāhā annahum lā yarjiʿūn. Many Muslim commentators maintain that ḥarām\nmeans “forbidden” h ere, which can involve positing that the Arabic contains a semantically\nredundant double negative (“It is forbidden to a town we have destroyed that they should\nreturn”; see Rippin 1979, 44–46, and SQ 826). However, in line with vario us translations\n(e.g., Bell 1937, Arberry 1955, or Jones 2007), a good case can be made that the phrase should\nin fact be translated, “A ban is upon any town that we have destroyed, such that they w ill not\nreturn” (Rippin 1979). It is moreover at least debatable w hether the consonantal sequence\nḥ- r- m should r eally be read ḥarām here.4\n3 One may object that at least the first of the three prohibitions under discussion upholds the general sa-\ncrality of God himself, while the second one follows from the sacrality of h uman life, which is explic itly said to\nhave been made inviolable by God (Q 6:151, 17:33, 25:68: al- nafs allatī ḥarrama llāhu). But it is far from clear how\nthis line of thinking would supply a rationale for Q 6:151’s prohibition of sexual improprieties or for other divine\nprohibitions in the Qur’an, such as the food taboos enumerated in Q 2:173 and its parallels.\n4 Rippin convincingly suggests that ḥarām in Q 21:95 might be standing in for Hebrew ḥērem, denoting a\n“ban” of destruction in the Hebrew Bible, e.g., at Isa 43:28 (Rippin 1979, 52–53; on the concept in general, see\nTDOT 5:180–199). This meaning is also attested for Jewish Aramaic ḥirma or Syriac ḥermā (DJBA 459 and 483–\n484; SL 492–493), making it quite conceivable that it might also have attached itself to an Arabic word derived\nfrom the same consonantal root. Note also that t here are quite a few variant readings for ḥarām at Q 21:95 (MQ\n6:55–57; MQQ 4:150–151; Rippin 1979, 48–51). A particularly widespread variant is ḥirm, which is among others\nattributed to some of the canonical readers. It is not impossible that Aramaic ḥirma or ḥermā might have become\nḥirm in Arabic. On the other hand, the noun ḥrm = “interdiction, prohibition” is also attested in Sabaic (Robin\n2015b, 186, with a transliteration and translation of Ḥaṣī 1, l. 11), and t here is also Sabaic evidence documenting\nthat the root ḥ- r- m was used to express the placing of a city under a ban of destruction, which goes back to the\nfirst millennium BCE (e.g., Robin 2018, 104, on DAI Ṣirwāḥ 2005–50).

Two verses (Q 5:2.97) conflate t hese two appellations into “the sacred\nhouse” (al- bayt al-ḥ arām). Although most of the relevant prooftexts are Medinan, there\nis at least one Meccan occurrence of al- masjid al-ḥ arām (Q 17:1), while Q 14:37, which is\nlikely also Medinan (Sinai 2009, 106–112), speaks of God’s “sacred house” (ʿinda baytika\nl- muḥarrami), using the passive participle of the verb ḥarrama, “to declare or regard s.th.\nas inviolable or sacred” (see below) in the same sense as the adjective ḥarām.5 According to\nQ 5:97, “God has instituted the Kaʿbah, the sacred h ouse, as a means of support for p eople”\n(jaʿala llāhu l- kaʿbata l- bayta l- ḥarāma qiyāman li- l- nāsi).6 This bears out the assumption\nthat the “sacred place of prostration” and the “sacred h ouse” may generally be identified\nwith the Meccan Kaʿbah.7 In the later Islamic tradition, some Qur’anic occurrences of\nal-m asjid al- ḥarām— notably, Q 17:1 and 9:28— are taken to designate the entire sacred\nprecinct surrounding the Kaʿbah (Hawting 1982, 37), an area to which two Qur’anic verses\napply the term ḥaram (Q 28:57, 29:67; see below). There is in fact no reason to rule out,\nor to consider it a major anomaly, that the Qur’an might on occasion have recourse to\nsuch an extended usage, derived from the primary reference of al- masjid al- ḥarām to the\nKaʿbah or “the house.”\nJudging by the Qur’an, the “sacred place of prostration” or the “house” was a pilgrimage\ndestination (→ ḥajja) at which sacrificial rites were performed (e.g., Q 48:25; → dhabaḥa)—\nthe latter aspect forming a contrast with what became normative post- Qur’anic practice\n(Hawting 2019, 101–102). It is the presence of the Kaʿbah sanctuary that would seem to\naccount for the “sacred precinct” (ḥaram) of whose safety and divine origin the Qur’an’s\nMeccan addressees are reminded in Q 28:57 and 29:67.8 Other verses (Q 2:126, 3:97, 14:35)\nalso stress the security of the Meccan settlement and its sanctuary, whose establishment,\nlike that of the ḥajj pilgrimage, the Qur’an traces back to Abraham (Q 2:124–129, 22:26–29;\nsee also 3:96–97 and 14:35–41). One infers that the sanctuary’s inviolability prominently\nentailed an interdiction on violent conflict in its vicinity, which is supported by a Medinan\ninjunction against fighting at the “sacred place of prostration” u nless the opponents attack\nfirst (Q 2:191). It is of interest that a similar prohibition of carry ing weapons during a pil-\ngrimage festival is documented by a Sabaic inscription (Maraqten 2021, 449).\n5 For other Meccan occurrences of the term bayt, “house,” see Q 52:4 and 106:3.\n6 As noted in CDKA 232, the meaning of jaʿala + acc. qiyāman li- in Q 5:97 is best understood in light of 4:5.\nPresumably, the way in which humans derive support from the Kaʿbah consists in, or at least includes, the safety\nand prosperity underpinned by its sacred status (Q 28:57, 29:67).\n7 The Kaʿbah is also mentioned in Q 5:95. See also Q 48:24–25, which refer to an encounter between the\nbelievers and their opponents bi- baṭni makkata, “in the valley of Mecca,” and then accuse the latter of barring\nthe believers from the “sacred place of prostration.” Also relevant is Q 3:96–97, according to which “the first\nhouse (bayt) that was established for the people” is located bi- bakkah, which could mean “in Mecca” (see n. 2\nunder → bayt).\n8 Q 28:57: “Have we not established a safe and sacred precinct for them, to which all kinds of fruit are\nbrought, as a provision from us?” (a-w a-l am numakkin lahum ḥaraman āminan yujbā ilayhi thamarātu kulli\nshayʾin rizqan min ladunnā); 29:67: “Have they not seen that we have made a safe and sacred precinct for them,\nwhile people all around them are being snatched away?” (a- wa- lam yaraw annā jaʿalnā ḥaraman āminan wa-\nyutakhaṭṭafu l- nāsu min ḥawlihim). See also Q 27:91: “I have only been commanded to serve the Lord of this\ntown, who declared it to be inviolable” (innamā umirtu an aʿbuda rabba hādhihi l- baldati lladhī ḥarramahā).\nḥarrama 215", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

One verse speaks in a derogatory\nmanner of the “prayers” that the repudiators are wont to perform at the “house” (Q 8:35),\nand it is only in a late Medinan surah that the “sacred place of prostration” is explic itly de-\nclared to be of limits to the pagan repudiators or associators (Q 9:17–19.28). Once, in the\ncontext of a passage to do with the ḥajj pilgrimage (Q 2:196–200), the attribute ḥarām is\napplied to a cultic site called al- mashʿar al-ḥ arām, “the sacred place of ritual,” which seems\nto be a stopping point in the pro cessional “pouring forth” (verb: afāḍa) of worshippers from\nʿArafāt (Q 2:198–199). Al- mashʿar al-ḥ arām is traditionally identified with al-M uzdalifah, a\nstation on the → ḥajj route as described by extra- Qur’anic sources (Hawting 2004, 95–96).\nQ 2:198 expresses approval of invoking God at this place (fa- dhkurū llāha ʿinda l- mashʿari\nl-ḥ arāmi). What is noteworthy are v. 198’s concessionary phrasing (“It is no sin for youp\nto . . . ,” laysa ʿalaykum junāḥun an) as well as v. 199’s command to “pour forth from where\npeople [are wont to] pour forth” (thumma afīḍū min ḥaythu afāḍa l- nāsu). Both expressions\nreveal that the cultic significance of the “sacred ritual site” and the pro cession leading t here\nfrom ʿArafāt are being presupposed as a well- established practice in the Qur’anic environ-\nment, what ever the exact location of the “sacred place of ritual” or the precise nature of\nthe actions performed t here. The same understanding that a pre- existing practice is being\ngiven Qur’anic approval is applicable to Q 2:158’s permission to circumambulate the sites\nof al- Ṣafā and al-M arwah while performing the ḥajj or the ʿumrah (see Firestone 1991, 375,\nand Hawting 2019, 98–99).\nThe “sacred months” (al- ashhur al-ḥ urum). Apart from the Kaʿbah sanctuary, the sec-\nond main entity to which the Qur’an prominently applies the attribute ḥarām are calendar\nmonths. Some of the relevant passages use the singular “the sacred month” (Q 2:194.217,\n5:2.97: al- shahr al-ḥ arām), a phrase also found in a poem from the corpus of al- Nābighah\n(DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 28:3). One verse speaks of “the sacred months” in the plu-\nral (Q 9:5: al-a shhur al- ḥurum) and another one gives the number of calendar months\nas twelve and says that four of them are “sacred” (Q 9:36: minhā arbaʿatun ḥurumun).\nThis agrees with extra- Qur’anic traditions reporting that on the eve of Islam the town of\nMecca and other parts of the Arabian Peninsula adhered to a calendar beginning with the\nmonth of Muḥarram and ending with Dhū l- Ḥijjah, and containing the sacred months\nRajab (no. 7), Dhū l- Qaʿdah (no. 11), Dhū l-Ḥ ijjah (no. 12), and Muḥarram (no. 1; see, e.g.,\nRAH 94–101; Bonner 2011, 16–17; Robin 2019a, 18–19; de Blois 2021). The only one of these\nmonths that is expressly named in the Qur’an is Ramaḍān (Q 2:185). Q 5:2.97 speak of the\n“sacred month” in connection with the “sacred house” (al- bayt al-ḥ arām) and aspects of\nthe pilgrimage ritual performed there— namely, “oferings” (vv. 2, 97: al- hady), sacrificial\nanimals marked out by ritual necklaces (vv. 2, 97: al- qalāʾid; see u nder → dhabaḥa), and\n“ those heading for the sacred house (āmmīna l- bayta l- ḥarāma), seeking favour and sat-\nisfaction from their Lord” (v. 2). This confirms that at least some of the sacred months in\nquestion were a time of seasonal cultic activity at the “sacred house.” “The sacred month”\nin the singular could refer to the month of Rajab, during which the ʿumrah pilgrimage may\noriginally have been performed (RAH 100). Yet given the close link that the Qur’an posits\nbetween the “house” and the ḥajj (see above), it may also be that “the sacred month” in the\nsingular refers to Dhū l-Ḥ ijjah, the month of the ḥajj pilgrimage. Q 2:197 says that “the ḥajj\n216 ḥarrama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The expression prob ably refers to the “sacred trimester” that\nis constituted by the consecutive months of Dhū l- Qaʿdah, Dhū l- Ḥijjah, and Muḥarram\n(RAH 100), thus positioning the ḥajj in a wider time frame without necessarily precluding\nthat it was specific to one of the months in question.\nA number of prohibitions to do with the sanctuary are set forth in explicit connection\nwith the “sacred month” or the ḥajj and were accordingly restricted to a certain time of\nthe year. Q 5:2 cautions the believers against “committing aggression” while mingling with\ntheir foes during the “sacred month” at the “sacred h ouse.” Q 2:197 prohibits quarrelling\n(jidāl) during the “specific months” of the ḥajj. To be sure, t hese statements tie in with the\ngeneral and temporally unqualified topos of the security of the Meccan sacred precinct,\nand Q 2:191 (“Dop not fight them at the sacred place of prostration u ntil they fight you\nthere”) implies that warfare in the vicinity of the sanctuary was generally considered to be\nunacceptable. But the sacred months seem to have entailed a general truce that extended\nbeyond the sanctuary, as becomes clear from Q 2:217. The verse responds to an audience\nquery about the legitimacy of fighting during “the sacred month”; while the address-\nees seem to assume that this is categorically prohibited, the Qur’an stresses that certain\nexceptional circumstances may justify it. In fact, a passage in Procopius’s History of the\nWars confirms that the “Saracenes” were wont to observe a general truce during certain\nsacred months (Robin 2010, 237–238, citing Procopius 1914, 400–403 = book 2:16:17–18;\nsee already RAH 100–101). Even at the sanctuary itself, certain prohibitions w ere evidently\nlimited to the sacred months. Thus, according to Q 5:1–2 and 5:95–96 participants in the\nḥajj festival were barred from hunting while in a state of ritual consecration (ḥurum; see\nvv. 1, 95, 96), but this interdiction lapsed a fter one had quite the state of ritual consecration\n(verb: ḥalla) and returned to profane life (v. 2: wa- idhā ḥalaltum fa-ṣ ṭādū). Q 2:197 also\nproscribes sexual intimacy (rafath; see CDKA 114) during the ḥajj. The Qur’an furthermore\nprohibits participants in the ḥajj rites from shaving their heads until they have ofered a\nconcluding sacrifice (Q 2:196; see also 48:27).\nAlthough it does seem clear that there was an existing disapproval of warfare during\nthe sacred months, it is not always evident to what extent Qur’anic interdictions relating\nto the sacred months simply continue existing pagan ḥajj practices or go beyond them. But\nin general, one may reasonably suppose that participants in the pre- Qur’anic ḥajj observed\nvari ous— and, as noted in Firestone 1991, 374, quite possibly heterogeneous— taboos of\nabstinence marking the temporary suspension of normal h uman life. Some of t hese are\nreflected and a dopted in the Qur’an, while others are modified or discarded: for instance,\nQ 2:189 rejects the prohibition of entering h ouses by the front door. Besides observing such\ntaboos, ḥajj celebrants no doubt performed a number of more or less well- defined ritual\nacts, which the Qur’an subsumes u nder the general rubrics of manāsik (singular: mansak),\n“rites” (Q 2:128.200; see also 22:34.67; see under → dhabaḥa), and shaʿāʾir allāh, “God’s\nobservances” (Q 2:158, 5:2, 22:32.36). Unfortunately, the Islamic scripture ofers only tan-\ntalising glimpses of such con temporary pilgrimage observances (for more details, gleaned\nfrom extra- Qur’anic sources, see u nder → ḥajj). Apart from sacrificial rituals (Q 5:2), they\nappear to have included circumambulation (verb: taṭawwafa or ṭāfa; see under → bayt)\nof the “house” (Q 2:125, 22:26.29) and also of other Meccan landmarks, which Q 2:158\nencourages or at least permits in a manner that again comes across as reflecting prevail-\ning custom (see also Hawting 2019, 98–99).

Such sacred\ninterdictions or interdiction- governed rites may be what the Qur’an calls ḥurumāt, a term\nthat is used in connection with “the sacred month” (Q 2:194) and with the “ancient house”\nand the ḥajj (Q 22:30).\nLike the “sacred place of prostration,” the material just surveyed suggests that re spect\nfor the “sacred months” was not exclusive to Muhammad and his adherents but was rec-\nognised by the latter’s “associating” adversaries as well. A fter all, the sanctuary and the\n“sacred month” are closely conjoined in Q 5:2.97, indicating that they were bound up\nwith one another in ritual practice. Moreover, Q 2:217 concedes the sanctity of “the sacred\nmonth” and then explains that in exceptional cases it may nonetheless be licit to conduct\nwar during it. This is best interpreted by assuming that re spect for the “sacred month” or\nmonths— whose standing is expressly acknowledged in Q 9:36— was part of the Qur’anic\naddressees’ cultural background, and that Q 2:217 is only concerned to allow for excep-\ntional circumstances u nder which it may nonetheless be legitimate to fight during this\nsacred season.\nThe verb ḥarrama and the Meccan surahs’ criticism of unwarranted pagan taboos.\nThe Qur’anic pagans seem to have observed further interdictions and taboos beyond t hose\nendorsed by the Qur’an, which may not have been directly linked to the Kaʿbah sanctuary\nand the ceremonies of the ḥajj. This emerges most clearly from a passage in the Meccan\nSurah 6 (vv. 136–153) that criticises a number of allegedly unwarranted h uman interdictions\non certain animals and crops, a passage studded with the second-f orm verb ḥarrama and its\npassive participle muḥarram (vv. 138, 139, 140, 143, 144, 145, 146, 148, 150). Before turning\nto this text, it will be useful to undertake a brief survey the Qur’anic use of the verb ḥar-\nrama in general and to examine two thematically cognate passages that are considerably\nshorter, Q 10:59 and 7:31–33.\nUnsurprisingly, ḥarrama has the general sense of rendering something, or declaring\nit to be, ḥarām, that is, unavailable, inaccessible, forbidden, or inviolable. Its antonym is\naḥalla, “to permit, to declare s.th. to be permitted” (Q 2:275, 3:50, 4:160, 5:87.96, 7:157,\n9:37, 66:1; see also ḥalla = “to be permitted” in 2:228–230 or 4:19). In lieu of ḥarrama and\naḥalla, Q 10:59 has jaʿala ḥarāman wa- ḥalālan, “to make forbidden and permitted,” thus\nestablishing the basic meaning of ḥarrama and aḥalla as just posited (see also Q 16:116).9\nAt the most general level, ḥarrama is to place restrictions on h uman access to, use of, or\ncontrol over something. Thus, in Q 5:72 fa- qad ḥarrama llāhu ʿalayhi l- jannata means that\nGod denies access to paradise to those who associate other beings with him, or restricts\nthem from paradise, and Q 7:50 quotes the inhabitants of paradise as stating that God has\ndenied to the repudiators the amenities that he metes out to the blessed (inna llāha ḥarra-\nmahumā ʿalā l- kāfirīn). A similarly general use of ḥarrama is found in Q 28:12, according\nto which God denied Moses the care of wet nurses (wa-ḥ arramnā ʿalayhi l- marāḍiʿa min\nqablu). Shading into the sense of moral prohibition, three verses condemn the killing of “a\n9 Q 10:59 combines ḥ- r- m and r- z- q, as do 6:140 and 7:32, where the former root takes the form of ḥarrama\nrather than of jaʿala ḥarāman. Moreover, Q 10:59 and also 16:116 combine ḥ- r- m and f- r- y, as do Q 6:138.140.144,\nagain with ḥ- r- m appearing in the form of ḥarrama. These phraseological links confirm the thematic connec-\ntions between all t hese passages and support the claim that jaʿala ḥarāman in Q 10:59 corresponds to ḥarrama\nin other passages.\n218 ḥarrama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But ḥarrama can also be used for h umans\nwho deem certain things to be prohibited (Q 5:87, 6:140, 9:29.37), just as Q 5:2 employs\naḥalla for a h uman attitude, namely, for failing to uphold the sacredness of “God’s obser-\nvances” and of the “sacred month,” that is, for profaning them (lā tuḥillū shaʿāʾira llāhi wa- lā\nl- shahra l-ḥ arāma). B ehind this stands a wider debate regarding the validity of sacred prohi-\nbitions that have been transmitted through ancestral tradition (on which see u nder → ab),\nand the Qur’anic claim that the sole legitimate source of such interdictions is God: humans\nare to conform— that is, they are not to fall short of but also not to go beyond— divine\ninterdictions as conveyed through God’s prophetic spokesmen. It may seem surprising\nthat in demanding conformity to divine prohibitions, the Qur’an’s focus is often not on\nhuman permissivism—as in Q 9:29’s condemnation of t hose who “do not deem forbidden\nwhat God and his Messenger have declared to be forbidden” (cf. u nder → jāhada)— but\nrather on a perceived human tendency to be excessively proscriptive: believers must not\n“deem forbidden the good things (ṭayyibāt) that God has permitted (aḥalla) to youp,” as\nthe Medinan verse Q 5:87 puts it.\nThis Qur’anic critique of unwarranted man- made prohibitions is a theological theme\nthat first emerges in Meccan surahs. Thus, Q 10:59 declares, a fter reminding people of\nGod’s favour and mercy (vv. 57–58), that the deity “sends down provision (rizq; → razaqa)”\nto h umans, yet the latter “make some of it forbidden and permitted” (fa- jaʿaltum minhu\nḥarāman wa- ḥalālan) despite lacking any divine authorisation for doing so (qul ā- llāhu\nadhina lakum, “Say, ‘Has God given you permission . . .’ ”). This stance is castigated as\namounting to “fabricating” (verb: iftarā) lies against God (am ʿalā llāhi taftarūn, “. . . o r are\nyou fabricating something against God?”).10 Read by itself, Q 10:59 condemns any attempt\nto restrict consumption of God’s gifts in terms of their immanent character, such as their\nalleged purity or impurity: to hold that some of the natur al resources that God has benevo-\nlently placed at the disposal of his h uman creatures are impure or prohibited, the verse avers,\nis theologically incompatible with God’s beneficence and generosity. Q 10:59 and other\npassages make it likely that the Meccan surahs espouse a position of dietary antinomianism\nthat bears resemblance to New Testamental statements like 1 Tim 4:4 (“every thing created\nby God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, provided it is received with thanksgiving”)\nand elem ents of l ater Christian tradition (Sinai 2019c, 124–127).\nIt is worth stressing in this context that the dietary antinomianism of the Meccan period\ndoes not entail rejection of the idea that some entities are validly described as ḥarām, since\nthe Qur’anic sanctuary is called al- masjid al- ḥarām as early as the Meccan verse Q 17:1.\nIt is however made clear that the sacrality of the Meccan shrine derives not from h uman\nconvention but from God, as per Q 27:91 (God is rabb hādhihi l- baldati lladhī ḥarramahā,\n“the Lord of this town, who declared it to be inviolable”). God is furthermore singled out\n10 In many other verses, including some from Surah 10, the verb iftarā takes the accusative object al- kadhiba,\ne.g., Q 3:94, 4:50, 7:37.89, 10:17.60.69, 11:18, 16:105.116, 18:15, 20:61. Although the verb can also take other direct\nobjects (e.g., Q 4:48: ithman ʿaẓīman), many verse- final occurrences of yaftarūn/taftarūna, as in Q 10:59, should\nbe understood as an ellipsis of iftarā l- kadhiba. In any case, what ever the object of iftarā, the verb by itself already\nsignifies untruthful concoction.\nḥarrama 219", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Neither of these two cases of sacred inviolability that are accepted in the\nMeccan Qur’an restricts h uman access to God’s natu ral provision, unlike the distinction\nbetween permitted and prohibited foodstufs that is rejected in Q 10:59. Indeed, God’s\nsanctification of the Meccan sanctuary is presented as an act of divine munificence rather\nthan as privative in character. Thus, Q 28:57 asks, “Have we not established a safe and\nsacred precinct for them, to which all kinds of fruit are brought, as a provision from us\n(rizqan min ladunnā)?”; and Q 29:67 classes God’s establishment of the Meccan ḥaram as\nan instance of divine grace or niʿmah (→ anʿama).\nThe same outlook expressed by Q 10:59 also informs 7:31–33. Verse 31 encourages the\n“ children of Adam” to wear adornments “at every place of prostration” (khudhū zīnatakum\nʿinda kulli masjidin) and to “eat and drink,” but commands them to do so temperately (wa-\nlā tusrifū). Given the word masjid, this may be directed specifically against the observance\nof sartorial and dietary taboos in connection with the Meccan sanctuary (in which case\nthe verse may stand in tension with the later Medinan passages Q 5:1–2 and 5:95–96).\nThe following verse, Q 7:32, poses the polemical question, “Who deems forbidden (man\nḥarrama) God’s adornment, which he has brought forth for his servants (zīnata llāhi llatī\nakhraja li-ʿ ibādihi), and the good t hings that he provides (al-ṭ ayyibāti mina l-r izqi)?” Those\nwho believe, v. 32 continues, are entitled to full enjoyment of the adornment and good\nthings provided by God, both in the proximate life and on the day of resurrection; and\nv. 33 declares that God has “only forbidden” (innamā ḥarrama rabbiya) “abominable deeds,\nwhether open or hidden” (al- fawāḥisha mā ẓahara minhā wa- mā baṭana), sin (al- ithma),\nunjust covetousness (al- baghya bi- ghayri l-ḥ aqqi), unwarranted association of other beings\nwith God, and “saying about God what youp do not know.” Like Q 10:59, 7:31–33 rejects\nman- made taboos restricting consumption of specific foodstufs and other earthly re-\nsources: to declare some of God’s provision to be forbidden is equivalent to “saying about\nGod what one does not know,” just as Q 10:59 considers it to be a case of “fabricating lies\nagainst God.”\nHuman and divine interdictions in Q 6:136–153. As noted e arlier, the dispute about\nunwarranted h uman taboos is most clearly foregrounded in the pivotal passage Q 6:136–153\n(on which see Lowry 2011 and also Gräf 1959, 39–44). In its canonical version, this text likely\ncontains a l ater Medinan insertion, consisting in vv. 145–146 or 145–147. Th ese added verses\nsecondarily recognise a small number of dietary taboos that became standard in the Medi-\nnan period (Sinai 2019c, 128–129), such as the prohibition of blood and pork, and thereby\ntones down the Meccan Qur’an’s original dietary antinomianism. When read without this\naddition, the discursive arc of the passage moves from a polemical refutation of the excessive\nprohibitions that h umans have arbitrarily contrived (vv. 136–150) to an exposition of the\nreasonable prohibitions that God has in fact imposed on them (vv. 151–153).11\n11 As noted by Lowry, vv. 151–153 function as the culmination or climax of the entire sequence beginning in\nv. 136 (Lowry 2011, 22, 23, 26). This observation further corroborates the claim that vv. 145–146 or 145–147 are a\nMedinan insertion (a position developed in Sinai 2019c, 128–129). In the passage’s original version, the climactic\nturning point in its movement from polemic to exposition— what one might call the peripety of the argument—\nwould have come only at the beginning of v. 151: qul taʿālaw atlu mā ḥarrama rabbukum ʿalaykum, “Say, ‘Comep\nand I will recite what your Lord has [ really] forbidden to you . . .’ ” Yet in the surah’s canonical version, this\nculminating peripety is preceded by an analogous turning point in v. 145 (qul lā ajidu fī mā ūḥiya ilayya muḥarra-\nman ʿalā ṭāʿimin yaṭʿamuhu illā an . . . , “Say, ‘I do not find in what has been conveyed to me anything forbidden\nto someone eating it except for . . .’ ”), after which the text returns to further polemics against the opponents’\n220 ḥarrama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Moreover, the opponents are accused of\npractising infanticide (vv. 137, 140). In v. 138, the discussion moves on to the opponents’\ncustom of declaring some livestock and crops to be forbidden ( here: ḥijr),12 which is to\nsay that certain persons are—a rbitrarily, from the Qur’anic perspective— denied the right\nto consume them (lā yaṭʿamuhā illā man nashāʾu bi- zaʿmihim). The opponents, moreover,\nconsider the backs of certain animals to be prohibited (wa- anʿāmun ḥurrimat ẓuhūruhā),\nmeaning that they cannot be ridden or used as beasts of burden.13 In addition, the oppo-\nnents do not invoke God’s name over some livestock, presumably when slaughtering them\n(wa- anʿāmun lā yadhkurūna sma llāhi ʿalayhā); perhaps they w ere instead accustomed to\ninvoking the associate deities from v. 136 on this occasion. Similar to Q 10:59, all of this\nis repeatedly declared to be tantamount to “fabricating lies against” (iftirāʾan ʿalā) God\n(vv. 138, 140; see also mā ±​<kānū> yaftarūn at the end of vv. 137 and 138). Q 6:139 then\nprovides further detail on the opponents’ objectionable taboos, such as the ofspring of\ncertain animals being reserved for men and “forbidden” (muḥarram) to w omen. From v. 141\nonwards, the text affirms God’s creation of gardens and plants, enjoining the recipients\nto “eat of their fruit when they bear fruit” and to give “what is due” of it “on the day of its\nharvest,” which may be a demand to practise charity (SQ 394) or to set aside a thanksgiving\nofering for God (Lowry 2011, 24). The following verse instructs the addressees with regard\nto livestock to “eat of that with which God has provided you” (v. 142: kulū mimmā razaqa-\nkumu llāhu). Verses 143–144 then pose a series of polemical questions that the opponents\nare apparently assumed to be incapable of answering (e.g., has God forbidden male sheep\nand goats, or female ones, or the ofspring of female ones?), thereby demonstrating the\nabsurdity of the idea that God might have “forbidden” (ḥarrama) the use and consump-\ntion of specific animals. Verse 144 ends by reiterating the accusation that adherence to\nunwarranted dietary taboos amounts to “fabricating lies against God” (fa-m an aẓlamu\nmimmani ftarā ʿalā llāhi kadhiban).\nSkipping over the Medinan insertion in Q 6:145–146 or 145–147, vv. 148–150 address\nand dismiss a defense attributed to the Qur’an’s associating opponents: “Had God willed,\nneither we nor our forefathers would have associated [anything with him], and we would\ntaboos. The canonical version of the text is thus marked by what one might call a false climax. However, when\nread without vv. 145–146 or 145–147 the passage is defensibly seen as possessing a higher degree of structural\ntransparency and rhetorical efectiveness, which provides supplementary confirmation that v. 145 does indeed\nopen a secondary addition. A further indication to the same efect consists in the fact that Q 6:136–153 without\nvv. 145–146 or 145–147 is structurally analogous to Q 7:31–33, which likewise moves from a critique of unfounded\nman- made taboos (vv. 31–32) to an exposition of God’s true prohibitions (v. 33). For a general description of\nredactional arguments like the preceding one, which are not devoid of a certain degree of subjectivity, see Sinai\n2017c, 71 (where they figure as “Class 2 arguments”).\n12 Cf. the use of ḥijran maḥjūrā in Q 25:22.53 (CDKA 67), especially the latter verse, which coordinates\nthe expression with barzakh, “barrier.” The context of Q 6:138 certainly justifies taking ḥijr to be equivalent to\nḥurrimat in the same verse and to muḥarram in v. 139.\n13 Cf. also the narrative about the killing of a she- camel consecrated to God by the p eople of Thamūd, despite\nthe fact that they had been commanded to let it roam freely, eat, and drink (Q 7:73, 11:64, 26:155, 91:13). The ta-\nbooisation of living animals was clearly culturally familiar to the Qur’anic addressees. It is standardly understood\nto be reflected in Q 5:103 as well, which enumerates four categories of what are taken to be consecrated camels\nthat w ere not to be ridden, burdened, or milked (see SQ 329 and Gräf 1959, 58–59).\nḥarrama 221", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Assuming that the argument that Q 6:148, and sim-\nilarly 16:35 and 43:20 (which also have law shāʾa llāhu/al- raḥmānu mā . . .), attribute to\nthe Qur’anic opponents is not a complete fiction, it illustrates how the Qur’anic preacher\nand his adherents managed to shift the argumentative ground under neath the feet of their\npagan antagonists. From the Qur’anic vantage point, any valid interdiction of foodstufs\nneeds to rest on divine prohibition. It is far from obvious that this equation of normative\nvalidity with divine endorsement had initially been shared by the Qur’anic associators,\nwho are ste reo typically presented as maintaining that they are following “the custom of\nour forefathers” (Q 2:170: mā alfaynā ʿalayhi ābāʾanā; 5:104, 31:21: mā wajadnā ʿalayhi\nābāʾanā; → ab). There is little reason to suppose that the Qur’anic adversaries considered\ntheir ancestral tradition to preserve and channel some sort of historic divine revelation;\nmore likely, they simply assumed that established custom was normative as such.14 Yet\nonce the Qur’anic preaching had explic itly insisted that valid norms must be grounded in\ndivine revelation, the associators seem to have strug gled to respond by admitting that the\ninterdictions observed by them w ere not based on divine endorsement. Instead, Q 6:148\nhas them invoke an indirect manner of divine endorsement: were ancestral tradition op-\nposed to God’s w ill, God— being omnipotent— would surely have found a way to exercise\nhis power of veto and to end the customs in question.\nThe associators’ argument is one from silence: considering the fact that God has not\ncurtailed our ancestral custom, it must be agreeable to him. Such a rejoinder, however,\nimplicitly concedes that normative validity is predicated on divine endorsement, and\nthereby lays the Qur’anic pagans open to being pressed to go beyond the argument from\nsilence rehearsed in v. 148 and supply positive proof that their customary interdictions\ndo in fact reflect God’s will. Thus, the Messenger is instructed to ask his opponents, “Do\nyou have any knowledge? If so, show it to us! You only follow mere opinion and engage in\nconjectures” (v. 148), and to say to them, “Bring yourp witnesses who can testify that God\nhas forbidden this (anna llāha ḥarrama hādhā)!” (v. 150). There would have been little\nthat the associators could have retorted to this further challenge, given that they claimed\nneither to be in possession of a scriptural corpus (→ kitāb) that would have bestowed “clear\nauthority” (→ sulṭān mubīn) upon their beliefs and practices (Q 37:156–157; see also 54:43,\n68:37–38) nor to be direct recipients of divine communications, as Muhammad claimed to\nbe. The associators’ ultimately self- defeating response in Q 6:148, 16:35, and 43:20, which\nconcedes that binding practices must rest on some sort of divine endorsement, may be an\nindication that no m atter how beleaguered the position of the Qur’anic believers was prior\nto the hijrah, they were ultimately able to marshal an epistemology of normative validity\nthat was felt to be cogent, perhaps in the wake of sufficient prior exposure of the Qur’anic\nmilieu to Jewish and Christian ideas.\nAs noted above, the entire sequence culminates in vv. 151–153, which set out a decalogue-\nlike list of the t hings that God has truly forbidden. Each of these three climactic verses ends\nin a partially identical closer underscoring that the Qur’anic proclamations convey positive,\ndirect, and unequivocal divine commandments, thus clearly surpassing the opponents’\nindirect and diluted claim to divine endorsement: “thus does he”— namely, God—“ charge\n14 On Q 7:28, which attributes to the opponents an utterance that would explic itly seem to equate ancestral\ncustom with God’s command, see → ab.\n222 ḥarrama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Medinan layer of the\nQur’an is marked by a shift t owards an understanding of divine revelations as a source of\ndetailed behavioural prescriptions (HCI 202–205 and Sinai 2015–2016, 51–52 and 66–67).\nThis means that God and his prophetic spokesmen, such as Jesus or Muhammad, are more\nfrequently than in the Meccan surahs depicted as permitting (aḥalla) and prohibiting\n(ḥarrama) certain things or behaviours (see Q 3:50 on Jesus, 7:157 on Muhammad, and\n9:29 on “God and his Messenger”).16 To review some of the relevant commandments,\nGod permits trade but prohibits usury (Q 2:275); he prohibits to the believers the con-\nsumption of carrion, blood, pork, and what has been sacrificed to other deities (Q 2:173,\n5:3, 6:145, 16:115); the believers are permitted commensality with “ those who were given\nthe scripture” and also intermarriage with their females (Q 5:5; see under → ˻ahl al- kitāb\nand Sinai 2017c, 85–89);17 God has punished the Jews (→ al- yahūd) by imposing onerous\ndietary prohibitions on them (Q 4:160, 6:146, 16:118);18 and he prohibits the believers from\nmarrying vario us kinds of blood relatives (Q 4:23–24) and women guilty of fornication\nor adultery (Q 24:3), while another passage enumerates the kinds of women whom the\nProphet is permitted to marry (Q 33:50–52).\nIn parallel with vari ous divine prohibitions, however, the Medinan proclamations con-\ntinue to stress that God and his Prophet permit consumption of “the good things” (al-\nṭayyibāt; Q 5:4.5.87, 7:157). Q 3:93 would seem to account for at least some parts of Jewish\ndietary law as resulting from the human tendency towards self- imposed interdictions\nthat is castigated in the Meccan passages discussed above: “all food was permitted (ḥill)\nto the Israelites, except what Israel [= the Biblical patriarch Jacob; → isrāʾīl] prohibited\nto himself, before the Torah was sent down” (see also u nder → tawrāh).

Ambros then diferentiates three more specific meanings of the plural al- aḥzāb,\nwhich may be regarded as variations on the basic sense just delineated.\nḤizb as a sectarian faction. The first of these plural meanings, in Ambros’s words,\nconsists in “certain religious groupings or factions.” A ḥizb in this sense is a group resulting\nfrom culpable sectarian disagreement (Q 19:37, 43:65: ikhtalafa) in the wake of, and indeed\nin spite of, prior divine revelation, such as the preaching of Jesus (see also under → al-\nnaṣārā). Passages employing the word ḥizb in this manner include not only Q 19:37 and\n43:65, which have the plural aḥzāb, but also 23:53 and 30:32 with the singular. In the latter\ntwo verses, religious discord and dissension are described not with the verb ikhtalafa but\nwith the phrases taqaṭṭaʿū amrahum baynahum, “they became divided among themselves\nover their afair” (Q 23:53; see under → zabūr), and farraqū dīnahum, “they introduced\ndivisions into their religion” (Q 30:32; for two other instances of → dīn2 and f- r- q, see 6:159\nand 42:13).1 As the preceding verses make clear, a ḥizb in the sectarian sense implies both\ncommunal discord and wilful dismissal of divinely revealed truth (see u nder → bayyana).\nQ 30:32 and 6:159 (and perhaps also 19:69?) establish that a pos si ble synonym of ḥizb in\nits sectarian meaning is shīʿah (CDKA 155), though the latter term can also have a positive\nacceptation (Q 37:83) or simply refer to a people or ethnic group (Q 15:10, 28:15).\nThe Qur’an’s rich terminology for religious conflict and disagreement suggests that its\nmilieu of origin was indeed a “sectarian” one, as one might phrase it with a nod to a well-\nknown book title (Wansbrough 1978). A number of passages tie religious disagreement\nto diferences over the meaning of “the scripture” (→ al- kitāb), which God is said to have\npreviously given to Moses (Q 2:176, 11:110, 41:45, all of which have ikhtalafa or its passive).\nSectarian disagreement in the Qur’anic milieu thus had an exegetical dimension. This is\n19 By contrast, Q 9:37 denounces the practice of intercalation (al- nasīʾ; see SQ 517 and Robin 2019a, 19–23)\nin terms of “permitting what God has forbidden” (fa- yuḥillū mā ḥarrama llāhu). Q 9:37 thus employs the inverse\nof the formulation “forbidding what God has permitted” in Q 5:87 and 66:1. Similar to Q 9:37, cf. also 9:29,\ncondemning those who “do not deem forbidden what God and his Messenger have declared to be forbidden”\n(wa- lā yuḥarrimūna mā ḥarrama llāhu; on this verse, see also under → jāhada).\n1 On farraqa more generally, see CDKA 212.\n224 ḥizb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Jefery makes the insightful observation that ḥizb in\nthe meaning presently u nder discussion recalls the New Testamental description of the\nSadducees and the Pharisees as a hairesis (FVQ 108; see Acts 5:17, 15:5, 26:5), a usage that is\nalso found in Josephus and that follows in the wake of the application of the word hairesis to\nphilosophical schools in Hellenistic Greek texts (see generally TDNT 1:180–184). The way\nin which the term hairesis—w hich the Ethiopic Bible renders as ḥәzb (FVQ 108)— figures\nin Acts 5:17, 15:5, and 26:5 is admittedly more neutrally descriptive than the Qur’an’s po-\nlemically charged notion of a sectarian ḥizb. But patristic authors went on to employ\nhairesis as a label for vari ous “heretical” teachers and groups (see generally Le Boulluec\n1985), i.e., for those who “do not merely fail to attain to the truth; under the malignant\ninfluence of the devil they actively repudiate it” (Runia 1988, 188). This strong connotation\nof culpability and wilful denial of divine truth yields an even closer fit with the Qur’anic\nstatements referenced above. The sectarian sense of Qur’anic ḥizb is therefore most likely\ninformed by Christian heresiological discourse. This is not to ignore the crucial diference\nthat the aḥzāb who, according to Q 19:37 and 43:65, fell into disagreement a fter Jesus are\nnot set in opposition to a unified Christian church preserving true doctrine, as in Christian\nheresiology, but rather seem to encompass those who ignore Jesus’s teaching that God is\n“my Lord and yourp Lord” and is alone worthy of being served (Q 19:36, 43:64: inna llāha ±​\n<huwa> rabbī wa- rabbukum fa-ʿ budūhu). The aḥzāb, in other words, seem to encompass\nthose who believe Jesus to be the son of God. In its Qur’anic adaptation, the Christian\ncategory of “the heretics” has therefore come to be generalised in such a way as to engulf\nmainstream Chris tian ity itself.2\nḤizb in the sense of an ancient gentile or scriptureless nation. Ambros’s second\nmeaning of al- aḥzāb are “certain pagan p eoples of the past,” meaning ancient communities\nwho were punished for rejecting a messenger sent by God, such as the p eoples of Lot and\nof Phar aoh and the tribes of ʿĀd and Thamūd (Q 38:11–13 and 40:5.30). For instance, Q 40:5\ndeclares that Muhammad’s opponents w ere preceded, in their denial of divine revelations,\nby “the people (qawm) of Noah and subsequent peoples (al- aḥzābu min baʿdihim),” and\nthen goes on to employ → ummah, which can refer to an ethnic community, as an apparent\nsynonym of ḥizb. Q 38:12–13 voice a similar accusation and explic itly include the people of\nNoah among “the aḥzāb.” This is not incompatible with Q 40:5, given that the latter only\ndistinguishes between the p eople of Noah and “the p eoples after them” (al- aḥzāb min baʿdi-\nhim). In both Surah 38 and Surah 40, the aḥzāb are ethnic communities from the ancient\nor pre-M osaic period of Qur’anic history: while Q 38:12–13 includes Pha raoh among the\naḥzāb, 40:30 has a believing cont emporary of Phar aoh look back upon the sorry fate of “the\naḥzāb.” When Q 15:10 makes reference to the “ancient communites” (shiyaʿ al- awwalīn),\nthis is almost certainly an approximate equivalent of al- aḥzāb in 38:11–13 and 40:5.30.\nAgainst Ambros and following Paret (KK 233), the second acceptation of al-a ḥzāb\nshould be taken to include Q 13:36, where the aḥzāb are contrasted with “t hose to whom we\n2 Another case in which the Qur’an redirects a Christian polemical motif against Christ iani ty is the Qur’anic\nclaim to be recapitulating the pristine creed of Abraham, who was “neither a Jew nor a Christian” (Q 3:67).

Fi nally, the third meaning of al-a ḥzāb dis-\ntinguished by Ambros are “the Meccan-l ed allied pagan forces attacking Medina in the\nWar of the Trench of 627 AD.” This sense is confined to Q 33:20.22, where the aḥzāb are\nclearly troops attacking Medina. Though it is open to debate whether the name and date\nof the military conflict that is presupposed by Surah 33 are as factually certain as Ambros\nimplies, it is obvious that we are here confronted with a distinct usage. Its patent military\nconnotations link it to the use of ḥzb in Sabaic, which designates military contingents of\nthe Abyssinian army (FVQ 108–109; Beeston et al. 1982, 75; Robin 1995, 228).4\nEtymology. Sabaic ḥzb would seem to be loaned from Ethiopic ḥәzb, whose vari ous\nmeanings Leslau enumerates as “nation, p eople, tribe, sect, multitude, crowd; partisans,\ngentiles, pagans, heathens” (Leslau 1991, 253). Clearly, the dif er ent senses of the Qur’anic\nword taxonomised above can be mapped onto vari ous facets of Ethiopic ḥәzb, including\nthe sectarian sense of Arabic ḥizb ≈ hairesis (see above) and also the meaning “gentile or\nscriptureless nation” (KU 19). This makes it very likely that Qur’anic ḥizb is ultimately\na loanword from Gәʿәz (see FVQ 108–109), as Jefery holds against Nöldeke and Horo-\nvitz (NB 59–60, KU 19), rather than being a native Arabic word that merely went on to\nacquire some of the meanings of Ethiopic ḥәzb. Jefery maintains that the word passed\nthrough South Arabia, which is plausible in princip le. Nonetheless, it is striking that the\nspectrum of meanings of Qur’anic ḥizb is considerably wider than that of Sabaic ḥzb, as\ncurrently attested, and that the Qur’anic verses in which ḥizb is closest to its Sabaic mean-\ning, Q 33:20.22, are Medinan and therefore later than most of its other occurrences. It is\nnot impossible that the ostensibly limited semantic spectrum of the Sabaic word is simply\ndue to the predominantly military and po liti cal focus of South Arabian inscriptions. The\nalternative, and potentially more exciting, interpretation would be to deem the good se-\nmantic fit between Arabic ḥzb and Ethiopic ḥәzb an indication of direct contact between\nthe Ethiopic tradition and Old Arabic.\nḥāsaba tr. | to call s.o. to account\n→ ḥisāb\n3 Ambros assigns both Q 11:17 and 13:36 to the first, sectarian meaning.\n4 See now also http://s abaweb .u ni -j ena .d e /S abaWeb /S uche /S uche /S earchResultDetail ?i dxLemma​\n=​1518&showAll​=​0 (accessed 6 November 2021), the reference to which I owe to Robin 1995.\n226 ḥāsaba", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In line with the Qur’an’s tendency to couch God’s al-\nlocation of other- worldly rewards and punishments in commercial meta phors\n(→ ajr, → sharā, → aqraḍa, → kasaba), the Qur’an frequently describes the eschatological\njudgement as a “reckoning” or a “calling to account” (ḥisāb; CDKA 70), from early Meccan\nproclamations (e.g., Q 84:8 and 88:26) to Medinan ones (e.g., Q 2:202.212). Accordingly,\nthe day of resurrection (→ qiyāmah) and judgement (→ din1) is in two Meccan surahs\ncalled the “day of reckoning” (yawm al-ḥ isāb; Q 38:16.26.53, 40:27). God is “swift of reck-\noning” (sarīʿ al- ḥisāb; Q 2:202, 3:19.199, 5:4, 13:41, 14:51, 24:39, 40:17); he calls humans\nto account (yuḥāsibkum) even for what they might conceal (Q 2:284);1 and he “fully re-\npays” (waffā) every one for his or her deeds (e.g., Q 11:15.111, 16:111, 39:70, 46:19), “fully\npays” to the believers their due eschatological wages (e.g., Q 3:57, 4:173: fa-y uwaffīhim\nujūrahum), and “fully settles” the balance of a sinner’s moral “account” or debit- credit\nbalance (Q 24:39: fa- waffāhu ḥisābahu). God’s reckoning is a thoroughly individualistic\none: “nothing of their reckoning is upon youS, and nothing of your reckoning on them”\n(mā ʿalayka min ḥisābihim min shayʾin wa- mā min ḥisābika ʿalayhim min shayʾin), the Mes-\nsenger is addressed with regard to those heeding his preaching (Q 6:52; see also 6:69).\nThe unfailing accuracy of God’s eschatological reckoning is underscored by linking it to\nindividual “writs” or “rec ord books” (singular: → kitāb) that register virtuous and sinful\nhuman deeds (Q 69:19–20.25–26). God himself, by contrast, is not subject to any reckoning\n(Q 2:212, 3:27.37, 24:38: “God gives provision to whom he wills, without being subject to\nreckoning”; allāhu yarzuqu man yashāʾu bi- ghayri ḥisāb).\nWhen it is stated that the blessed in paradise are rewarded “without reckoning” (bi-\nghayri ḥisāb; Q 39:10, 40:40), the meaning is not that the reward of the blessed is unrelated\nto their earthly conduct or that they are not subject to an eschatological vetting of their\nthis- worldly per for mance at all. Rather, ḥisāb must in this context stand for the threaten-\ning and negative prospect of divine retribution or the “bad reckoning” (sūʾ al-ḥ isāb) with\nwhich the evildoers are threatened elsewhere (Q 13:18.21). Specifically, the point may be\nthat God “erases” the believers’ evil acts (Q 42:25) or “absolves” them of their misdeeds\n(Q 39:35; see in more detail under → ajr and → kaffara).\nPre-Q ur’anic background. In casting God’s judgement as a calling to account, the\nQur’an presupposes the reconceptualisation of sin as “a debt to be repaid” that Gary An-\nderson has identified as a seminal legacy of the Second Temple period, a conceptual shift\nthat is attested both in the New Testament and in the rabbinic tradition (Anderson 2009).\nThus, cognate expressions of the Qur’anic term ḥisāb are found in rabbinic and Christian\ntexts, namely, Hebrew ḥeshbon (m. Abot 3:1; Torrey 1892, 9) and Syriac ḥūshbānā. The\nlatter appears, for instance, in the Peshitta’s rendering of Matt 18:23, a parable in which\nGod is likened to a king who “wished to s ettle accounts” or to “have a reckoning” (nessab\n1 The third- form verb ḥāsaba is relatively rare; apart from Q 2:284, see 65:8 and 84:4.

Wisdom thus resembles the attribute of mercy, which\ncan also be exemplified by humans (see u nder → al- raḥmān); to borrow from Ibn ʿArabī,\nboth are “names of similarity” (Chittick 1989, 58). It is evident that divine wisdom is para-\ndigmatic and prior in relation to its human counterpart: the vast majority of the Qur’an’s\n97 occurrences of the adjective ḥakīm (from Aramaic/Syriac ḥakkīm/ ḥakkīmā), which\nis usually employed in verse- final position, pertain to God, who is said to be wise or the\none who is supremely wise (al-ḥ akīm; e.g., Q 2:32.129, 3:6.18.62.126). This state of afairs,\ntoo, is similar to what one finds with regard to the attribute of mercy or compassion, since\nmost Qur’anic derivatives of r-ḥ - m likewise refer to God.\nThe very l imited number of entities other than God to which the qualifier “wise” is ap-\nplied include “the scripture” (→ al- kitāb; Q 10:1, 31:2), meaning the Qur’anic revelations’\ncelestial archetype, and “the recitation” (al- qurʾān, on which see u nder → qaraʾa), the body\nof Arabic revelations that make the celestial scripture available to Muhammad’s addressees\n(Q 36:2, 43:2–4).3 Despite the prevalent association of wisdom with God, however, wis-\ndom is also a quality that can be displayed by humans: David was given kingship (mulk;\nsee u nder → malik) and wisdom (ḥikmah), Q 2:251 says (cf. similarly 38:20); Luqmān,\ntoo, received wisdom from God (Q 31:12); and Q 2:269 generalises that God gives wisdom\nto whomever he w ills (yuʾtī l-ḥ ikmata man yashāʾu). Human wisdom derives from God:\naccording to a significant number of verses, what humans may ideally hope to gain from\nGod is both access to the celestial scripture (al- kitāb) and to wisdom (al-ḥ ikmah): Mu-\nhammad is said to teach or to have received both (Q 2:129.151.231, 3:164, 4:113, 62:2), as did\nthe descendants of Abraham (Q 4:54: fa- qad ātaynā āla ibrāhīma l- kitāba wa- l-ḥ ikmata),\nJesus (Q 3:48, 5:110),4 and indeed all prophets (Q 3:81).\nWisdom and revelation. If Luqmān was, apparently, given wisdom without sim ul ta-\nneously being made privy to “the scripture“ (Q 31:12), could one be given “the scripture”\n1 My understanding of wisdom in the Qur’an is bound to be influenced, in more ways than I am retrospec-\ntively able to disentangle, by Saqib Hussain’s MPhil and DPhil research, done under my supervision at Oxford\nsince 2017 (Hussain 2022b). Hence, even though the following does not endorse all of the conclusions reached\nin the latest version of Hussain’s doctoral thesis that I have seen, where my claims do intersect with Hussain’s\nresults it will be safest to assume that the arrow of influence runs from him to me rather than vice versa.\n2 This is not to deny that the relevant traits may take a dif er ent form depending on whether they are\nrealised in God or humans. For example, God’s love and anger are perfectly proportionate to prior desert (see\nunder → ghaḍiba and → al-r aḥmān), whereas this is evidently often not true, or perhaps never fully true, of\nhuman love and anger.\n3 Q 3:58 speaks of al- dhikr al- ḥakīm, “wise exhortation” (see under → dhakkara) that is imparted to the\nQur’anic Messenger. In Q 44:4, it is God’s commands or decrees that are described as wise (fīhā yufraqu kullu\namrin ḥakīm); see under → amr.\n4 Uniquely in the case of Jesus, the pair “the scripture and wisdom” is expanded by “the Torah (→ al- tawrāh)\nand the Gospel (→ al- injīl)” (Q 3:48, 5:110).

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:252", "title": "Page 252", "locator": "pdf_page:252", "text": "without wisdom? An affirmative answer might be suggested by the fact that it is repeat-\nedly affirmed that God gave Moses “the scripture” without any accompanying reference\nto wisdom (Q 2:53.87, 6:154, 11:110, 17:2, 23:49, 25:35, 28:43, 32:23, 37:117, 41:45; cf. 6:91).\nHowever, we saw above that Q 10:1 and 31:2 apply the adjective “wise” to the celestial\nscripture itself, which implies that wisdom is an inherent aspect of the latter (Goudarzi\n2018, 226). It follows that when Moses is reported to have been given the scripture, this\nimplies that he also partook of God’s wisdom. This view is, moreover, consistent with the\nfact that Q 7:145 considers the tablets bestowed upon Moses to have contained “admoni-\ntion” (mawʿiẓah; Schmid 2021, 336), which is a term that Q 16:125 links with wisdom (see\nbelow). Indeed, that Moses, too, shared in God’s wisdom is only what one would expect\ngiven the affirmations that the descendants of Abraham and the prophets in general re-\nceived “the scripture and wisdom” (Q 4:54, 3:81). Most likely, the celestial scripture is to\nbe understood as the consummate manifestation of divine wisdom, even if God may also\nchoose to dispense wisdom to someone who is, like Luqmān, not sim ul ta neously granted\nscriptural revelations proper.\nThe figure of Luqmān in Surah 31 clearly functions as a spokesman of Qur’anic doctrine,\nas illustrated in more detail below. This suggests that what one might call the “natur al” (i.e.,\nnon- revelatory) rational faculties of h umans are deemed capable of arriving at least at some\nof the hallmarks of Qur’anic revelatory instruction. It would be less appropriate to qualify\nthe Qur’anic understanding of natur al reason as “unaided,” however, since Luqmān is said to\nhave received his wisdom from God (Q 31:12). If a h uman is truly wise, this must be reckoned\nto be a divine gift, even if the wisdom in question was not transmitted via revelation. The\nlogic b ehind this position must be that any event in the world, such as the gestation of h uman\nembryos from sperm (e.g., Q 75:37), the falling of rain (e.g., Q 6:99), or the fact that birds\ndo not drop from the sky (Q 16:79), is in the final instance to be credited to God. Moreover,\nthe fact that the deliverances of Luqmān’s natur al reason overlap so closely with the content\nof divine revelation is in line with the extent to which the Qur’an is concerned to highlight\nthat pivotal theological truths are bolstered by a g reat number of “signs” (singular: → āyah)\nthat an open- minded h uman observer may discern in the cosmos and in h uman history.\nTowards a profile of Qur’anic wisdom. What, then, is the Qur’anic understanding\nof wisdom? A full answer is beyond the confines of this entry and forms the subject of a\nrecent doctoral thesis by Saqib Hussain, which also examines links between the Qur’an\nand the sapiental legacy of Biblical and subsequent Judaeo- Christian lit er a ture (Hussain\n2022b). But three provisional remarks can be made.\nFirst, in line with the foregoing conclusion that the Qur’an does not conceive of wisdom\nas something that is distinct from the celestial scripture, the content of wisdom in the\nsense of a body of insights that may be attained by humans coincides to a significant degree\nwith the content of revelation and vice versa. Thus, as Goudarzi notes (Goudarzi 2018,\n225), Q 54:4–5 describes the deterrent “tidings” (nabaʾ) that have reached the Qur’anic\nopponents— that is, information about God’s punitive obliteration of past nations, about\nthe eschatological judgement, or about both—as “compelling wisdom” (ḥikmah bālighah)\nand associates the latter with divine “warnings” (nudhur; singular: nadhīr, on which see\nunder → bashshara). Wisdom consequently overlaps with the Qur’anic kerygma of an\ninevitable eschatological reckoning, which the Qur’an pre sents as something for which\ncontemplation of the natu ral world provides weighty indicators (e.g., Q 86:5–9). The\nsame conclusion of substantial overlap between wisdom and revelation also arises from\n230 ḥikmah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The concluding verse\nof this passage, Q 17:39, says that the preceding “belongs to the wisdom that yourS Lord\nhas conveyed (→ awḥā) to you” (dhālika mimmā awḥā ilayka rabbuka mina l- ḥikmati).\nWisdom thus includes standard Qur’anic norms like mono the ism and charity, again in-\ndicating substantial common ground between the content of sapiential and revelatory\nteaching. Another piece of evidence pointing in the same direction is the extended tes-\ntamental address by Luqmān that is quoted in Q 31:13–19 (Schmid 2021, 328–333), which\nbriefly changes into the divine voice in vv. 14–15. Key pieces of advice given by Luqmān\nare the need to steer clear of associating partners (verb: → ashraka) with God (Q 31:13),\ndivine omniscience (Q 31:16), the imperative of performing prayer (Q 31:17), and an appeal\nto cultivate the virtues of steadfastness and humility (Q 31:17–19). There is, again, little\nhere that might not also figure as a straightforward divine command. This is very neatly\nillustrated by the fact that, as just noted, Q 31:14–15, which set out the need to be kind to\none’s parents, briefly slip into the divine voice, in keeping with a number of close Qur’anic\nparallels (Q 2:83, 4:36, 6:151, 17:23–24, 29:8, 46:15).5\nSecondly, to describe certain utterances or teachings as constituting “wisdom” in-\nvolves an emphasis on their intelligibility by and persuasiveness to h uman recipients,\nor at least to human recipients who are rightly disposed and not obdurately impervious.\nSupporting this contention, Q 16:125 counsels the Qur’anic Messenger to “call to the\nway of your Lord with wisdom and with fair admonition (al-m awʿiẓah al- ḥasanah), and\ndispute with them in the fairest manner (wa-j ādilhum bi-l latī hiya aḥsanu).” Luqmān,\ntoo, who is singled out as a recipient of wisdom in Q 31:12, is portrayed as “admonishing”\n(verb: waʿaẓa; see Schmid 2021) his son in 31:13, while 2:231 refers to “what God sent\ndown of the scripture and the wisdom in order to admonish youP thereby” (mā anzala\nʿalaykum mina l- kitābi wa- l- ḥikmati yaʿiẓukum bihi). Hence, the Qur’an recurrently links\nwisdom with hortatory communication, expressed by the root w- ʿ- ẓ: Qur’anic wisdom is\nno esoteric gnosis reserved for a select few but rather involves an emphasis on discursive\noutreach. Moreover, Q 38:20, in recounting God’s blessings upon David, pairs wisdom\nwith “decisive speech” (wa- ātaynāhu l- ḥikmata wa- faṣla l- khiṭāb). Taken together, the\nverses just surveyed show that a possessor of wisdom is somebody who is able to speak,\ninstruct, and advise authoritatively and persuasively. This is also borne out by the fact\nthat the Decalogue- like list of commandments in Q 17:22–39, which is categorised as\nconstituting “wisdom” in its concluding verse, exhibits a noticeable concern to spell out\n“the rationale behind its commandments” (Goudarzi 2018, 226, n. 95; see also Hussain\n2022b, 176–229). All of this is separated by some distance from the distinction that Paul\nmakes between the wisdom of God and the wisdom of the world (1 Cor 1:18–2:16 and\n3:18–20). From the Qur’anic vantage point, genuine worldly wisdom is not in tension\nwith divine wisdom but expressive of it.\nThirdly, and perhaps most crucially, in what sense does the Qur’an ascribe wisdom to\nGod? The formulaic nature of Qur’anic predications of the attribute ḥakīm, “wise,” makes\nit difficult to answer this question with much precision, since the degree to which verse-\nfinal theological predications in the Qur’an correlate with preceding statements remains\n5 To illustrate the phraseological similarities between these passages, Q 29:8, 31:14, and 46:15 have waṣṣaynā\nl- insāna bi- wālidayhi ±​<ḥusnan/iḥsānan>.

Most frequently, the predicate ḥakīm is coupled with ʿalīm, “knowing,\nknowledgeable” (e.g., Q 2:32, 4:11.17), and ʿazīz, “mighty” (e.g., Q 2:129.209.220). God,\nthen, is qualified by knowledge, power, and wisdom. While these three attributes should\nprob ably not be regarded as neatly separable from one another, it is plausible to interpret\nGod’s wisdom as bridging his knowledge and his power: God’s wisdom, one may propose,\nis not a purely cognitive trait, like his knowledge; rather, it signifies the active exercise of\nGod’s all- encompassing supremacy over all t hings in a way that reveals knowledge and\npurpose, and is amenable to being recognised as such by h umans. As a handful of passages\ndeclare, God did not create the world “for mere play” (Q 21:16, 44:38: lāʿibīn), “in a futile\nmanner” (Q 3:191, 38:27: bāṭilan), or “for sport” (Q 23:115: ʿabathan; see also u nder → balā).\nThat God is wise, therefore, entails that his actions are at least broadly comprehensible as\nwise by human agents.6 After all, as we saw above, when wisdom manifests itself on the\nhuman plane, it is associated with intelligible and persuasive communication; and the\nQur’an certainly speaks sufficiently often of a bestowal of wisdom upon humans in order\nto undercut the suggestion that God’s wisdom is in princip le inaccessible to mortals. Un-\nderstanding divine wisdom to involve the basic intelligibility of God’s deeds, moreover, fits\nwell with the Qur’an’s per sis tent concern to establish two fundamental points: that mani-\nfold natur al phenomena evince God’s generous solicitude for humans and the sagacious\nmanner in which human welfare is served by the divinely orchestrated course of nature\n(see under → arḍ and → āyah); and that the general standards by which God judges the\nmoral per for mance of his creatures display conformity with human ethical intuitions (see\nunder → al- raḥmān, → ẓalama and → maʿrūf).\nThe mystery of God’s ways (Q 21:23, 18:65–82). But it is vital to signal counterpoints\nto the preceding. Most importantly, one Qur’anic verse states quite plainly that God “is\nnot interrogated about what he does,” unlike humans (Q 21:23: lā yusʾalu ʿammā yafʿalu\nwa-h um yusʾalūn; see Zirker 1993, 204–220): it is not for humans to sit in judgement over\nGod. This pronouncement coheres with the general fact that the Qur’an, in contrast to\nthe Hebrew Bible, does not portray figures of indisputable religious and moral integrity\nagonising in good faith over how the factual state of the world and of human afairs can\nbe reconciled with the general postulates of God’s wisdom and goodness (Zirker 1993,\n204–220, and Alexander 2006, 380; see also the remarks on theodicy under → ẓalama).\nWhile the Qur’an unequivocally proclaims God’s wisdom and justice, often formulaically\nso, there is little sustained attempt to defend these traits in the face of ostensibly coun-\ntervailing evidence. Q 21:23 suggests that this is quite deliberate. The verse does not, it is\nworth adding, necessarily point to a voluntarist or theistically subjectivist account of value,\naccording to which God may define the content of normative concepts like “good,” “just,”\nor “wise” in whichever way he pleases (see, e.g., Hourani 1985, 57–66); the verse merely\nasserts that no one is endowed with such authority and insight as to be capable of objec-\ntively finding God to be in breach of the requirements of goodness, justice, or wisdom.\nThe general lesson of Q 21:23, that God is not answerable for what he does, is further\nunpacked in Q 18:65–82, a memorable passage relating Moses’s travels in the com pany of\nan anonymous “servant” of God who performs three acts that initially appear inexplicable\nor outrageous but are subsequently revealed to have produced a morally optimal outcome\n(see Zirker 1993, 211–213, and under → ṣabara).

While the root ḥ-k -m is absent from Q 18:65–82, the passage\nconveys a basic message that is topically relevant to the pre sent entry: even a person\nof the religious standing of Moses may easily fail to show an appropriately “steadfast”\n(ṣ-b -r ) trust in God’s mercy (Q 18:65.82: raḥmah; see under → al-r aḥmān) and in God’s\nknowledge (Q 18:65.66: ʿ-l -m ; 18:68: kh-b -r )— divine qualities that in the narrative at\nhand are mediated by Moses’s enigmatic companion. If one applies this general moral to\nthe Qur’anic insistence on God’s wisdom, it follows that even though God’s wisdom is\nevident from many aspects of the world surrounding us, in many situations it is nonethe-\nless bound to remain mysterious how exactly the actual course of events realises divine\nknowledge, mercy, and wisdom.\nTo enlist an image, one might call this the iceberg model of God’s wisdom, justice,\nand mercy: the divine attributes in question are to some extent held to be manifest and\nhumanly comprehensible; yet in other re spects they are assumed to remain inaccessibly\nunder water, as it were, making it partially necessary to take them on trust. (A strong\ncase can be made that a mono the istic world- view will, ceteris paribus, gain in stability by\nespousing some version of the iceberg model: if God’s wisdom or goodness are held to\nbe entirely inaccessible, God risks appearing inept or malicious, which can spark theo-\nlogical innovation; but if God’s wisdom or goodness are held to be entirely accessible and\ncomprehensible, it is highly likely that at least some facts about the world w ill appear to\nserve God’s assumed purposes in a less than optimal fashion.) The iceberg model may be\nidentified as a chief reason for why the Qur’an exhibits a palpable tendency to block de-\ntailed theodicean discourse rather than presenting it as a legitimate thread in the tapestry\nof human belief in God (see also under → ẓalama). The rationale under lying this Qur’anic\nstance can perhaps be explicated as follows: there is no way of dispensing humans from\nhaving to accept that their understanding of God’s wisdom has real and poignant limits;\nit is therefore a religious virtue to be able to restrain oneself from seeking to peek b ehind\nthese limits, or from railing against them, in the first place.\nḥalla intr. | to be permitted; to quit the state of ritual consecration\naḥalla tr. | to permit s.th.; to treat s.th. as profane\nḥalāl, ḥill | permitted\nmaḥill | place of sacrifice\nSee under → ḥarrama; on maḥill, see under → dhabaḥa.\nḥ-m , ḥ-m -ʿ - s- q (surah- initial letter sequences)\n→ ʾ- l-r\nḥamida tr. | to praise s.o.\n→ ḥamd\nḥamida 233", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

To believe (→ āmana)\nin God involves being grateful to him for all that he has bestowed on humans (see\nu nder → kafara) and to internalise that he is “ free from any needs (ghaniyy), praisewor-\nthy (ḥamīd),” as a number of l ater Meccan and Medinan verse closers put it (Q 2:267, 4:131,\n14:8, 31:12, 64:6; 22:64, 31:26, 35:15, 57:24, 60:6 have al- ghaniyy al- ḥamīd). Humans, by\ncontrast, are needful of (fuqarāʾ ilā) God (Q 35:15; cf. 47:38).1 Humans give expression to\nthis realisation by praising and glorifying God, activities that the Qur’an designates by\nderivatives of the roots ḥ- m- d and s- b-ḥ . Both speech acts are virtually exclusively directed\nat God in the Qur’an, even if Q 17:79 promises the Qur’anic Messenger a “praiseworthy\nrank” (maqām maḥmūd).2\nCommands to “glorify” (verb: sabbaḥa) God or God’s name (→ ism) are already prom-\ninent in early Meccan surahs (Q 15:98, 52:48.49, 56:74.96, 69:52, 87:1, all of which have the\nsingular imperative sabbiḥ).3 A preferred time for such glorification seems to have been at\nnight (Q 20:130, 50:40, 52:49, 76:26) as well as in the morning and eve ning (Q 3:41, 19:11,\n20:130, 33:42, 38:18, 40:55, 48:9, 50:39). Moreover, the activity of glorifying God must\nhave been accompanied by prostration (verb: → sajada), which is repeatedly paired with\nsabbaḥa (Q 7:206, 15:98, 32:15, 76:26). Glorifying God is thus to be viewed as a ritual act\nperformed at specific times and involving set bodily postures and movements. It is, in other\nwords, a form of, or tantamount to, prayer (ṣalāh; → ṣallā). As regards the root ḥ- m- d, the\nQur’an predominantly employs it in the form of the attribute ḥamīd, “praiseworthy,” ap-\nplied exclusively to God, and the noun ḥamd, “praise.” The latter is especially frequent in\nthe exclamation al-ḥ amdu li-l lāhi, “Praise be to God,” which has twenty-t hree occurrences\n(e.g., Q 1:2, 6:1.45, 7:43, 37:182, 39:29.74.75, 40:65). Although al-ḥ amdu li-l lāhi is limited\nto Meccan surahs, the opening verse of the Medinan Surah 64 declares that God’s is “the\nkingdom and to him belongs praise” (Q 64:1: lahu l-m ulku wa-l ahu l-ḥ amdu).4\n1 See also Q 3:181, condemning an utterance by anonymous (perhaps Jewish) contemporaries who repre-\nhensibly inverted this state of afairs by calling God poor (faqīr) and humans rich (aghniyāʿ).\n2 See also Q 3:188, briefly referenced below.\n3 Sabbaḥa can e ither take a direct object (e.g., Q 7:206: yusabbiḥūnahu) or a prepositional one, w hether\nintroduced by li- (e.g., Q 17:44: tusabbiḥu lahu l-s amāwātu l- sabʿu wa- l- arḍu wa-m an fīhinna) or bi- (e.g., Q 69:52:\nfa- sabbiḥ bi-s mi rabbika l-ʿ aẓīm). Th ere is also an absolute usage of sabbaḥa without direct or prepositional object,\n“to be engaged in praising God, to utter prayers of praise,” which is elliptical (e.g., Q 3:41, 19:11).\n4 The entire second half of Q 64:1 runs lahu l- mulku wa- lahu l- ḥamdu wa-h uwa ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr.\nIf one is prepared to depart from the reasonable policy of rendering ḥamd as “praise” throughout, one might\ntranslate this verse as “his is the kingdom, and his is the glory, and he is endowed with power over every thing,”\n234 ḥamd", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In other cases,\nsubḥāna . . . s eems straightforwardly equivalent with al-ḥ amdu li-l lāhi (e.g., Q 17:1.108, 27:8,\n36:36.83, 43:13). That t here is at least partial synonymity between both phrases is illustrated\nby Q 30:17–18, where a subḥāna exclamation (v. 17: fa- subḥāna llāhi, “Glory be to God”) is\ncontinued by a statement employing ḥamd (v. 18: wa- lahu l-ḥ amdu fī l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍi,\n“and praise be to him in the heavens and on earth”). The semantic intersection between the\nroots ḥ- m- d and s- b-ḥ is also evident from the phrase sabbaḥa bi-ḥ amdi X (on which see also\nbelow), with X consisting e ither in a possessive suffix referring to God (e.g., Q 2:30, 13:13,\n17:44, 25:58) or in rabbi + possessive suffix, “your/his Lord” (e.g., Q 15:98, 20:130, 32:15,\n39:75). A literal rendering of sabbaḥa bi-ḥ amdi X might run “to glorify X by praising him,”\nthough “to glorify and praise X” is arguably more elegant.\nIt is notable that a finite form of the verb ḥamida, “to praise s.o.,” is attested only once\nin the Qur’an, in Q 3:188, which criticises those “who love to be praised for what they\nhave not done” (wa- yuḥibbūna an yuḥmadū bi- mā lam yafʿalū). Apart from Q 9:112, which\nlauds “ those who utter prayer of praise” (al-ḥ āmidūn), the standard Qur’anic manner for\nexpressing “to praise God” is always the complex phrase sabbaḥa bi-ḥ amdi X instead of\nsimple ḥamida. Thus, in Q 2:30 the angels express the fact that they are engaged in praising\nGod by the words naḥnu nusabbiḥu bi- ḥamdika rather than by naḥnu naḥmaduka. The\nreason for this marked preference for sabbaḥa or sabbaḥa bi-ḥ amdi over ḥamida can only\nbe conjectured, but it is relevant to note that sabbaḥa is a loanword from Syriac shabbaḥ\n(FVQ 161–162) and may as such have connoted liturgical praise of God in par tic u lar, given\nthat the loan is likely to have arisen among Arabophone Christians who w ere exposed to\nSyriac religious terminology. Building on a suggestion made by Goitein, it is pos si ble,\ntherefore, that the Qur’anic penchant for sabbaḥa bi- ḥamdi is predicated on an implicit\ndistinction between ordinary professions of praise whose object may well be humans,\ndesignated by simple ḥamida (as illustrated by Q 3:188), and ritually schematised praise\nof God, designated by sabbaḥa bi- ḥamdi (Goitein 1966, 75–76). The latter activity is not\nonly demanded of h umans but is also modelled by the angels surrounding God’s throne,\nwho “glorify and praise God and believe in him and ask for forgiveness on behalf of the\nbelievers” (Q 40:7: yusabbiḥūna bi-ḥ amdi rabbihim wa-y uʾminūna bihi wa-y astaghfirūna\nwhich amounts to a permutation of the traditional conclusion of the Lord’s Prayer, as attested by part of the\nmanuscript tradition for Matt 6:13: “For yours is the kingdom (hē basileia) and the power (hē dynamis) and the\nglory (hē doxa) forever. Amen.” Lahu l-ḥ amdu has only three more Qur’anic occurrences (Q 28:70, 30:18, 34:1,\nall of which are later Meccan) and is thus relatively rare, certainly in comparison with the greater number of\nverses that have subḥāna + possessive suffix.\nḥamd 235", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Indeed, the Qur’an stresses that every thing and every one\nin the heavens and on earth is in some sense engaged in glorifying God (Q 17:44, 24:41,\n57:1, 59:1.24, 61:1, 62:1, 64:1; see under → arḍ and → sajada, and cf. the parallel in Jacob\nof Sarug found in Mathews 2020, 18–19, l. 1932).\nPre- Qur’anic background. Al-ḥ amdu li-l lāhi, like its approximate equivalent subḥāna\nllāhi, is an Arabisation of Greek doxa tō theō or Syriac teshbūḥtā l- allāhā (GQ 1:112, n. 1).\nSuch doxologies widely permeate the Christian tradition, whether in the third person or\nin the second- person form “Glory be to you,” doxa soi (Baumstark 1927, 234–236), whose\nfunctional counterpart in the Qur’an would be subḥānaka. The doxa tō theō formula is most\nfamously represented by the angels’ song of praise at the Nativity (Luke 2:14: “Glory to\nGod in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among t hose whom he favours”), which\nsubsequently grew into the prayer called the Gloria in Excelsis Deo or the “ Great Doxol-\nogy,” a Greek version of which is cited in the fourth- century Apostolic Constitutions 7:47\n(Metzger 1985–1987, 3:112–113; for a Syriac version according to an eighteenth- century\nmanuscript, see Ebied 2017). The phrase al-ḥ amdu li-l lāhi and its variants bi-ḥ amdi llāhi\nand bi- ḥamdi l-i lāhi occur already in pre-I slamic poetry (Sinai 2019b, 31, 53), including\nthe Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd (al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 6:19; Tamer 2008, 74). One infers\nthat the Arabic formula al- ḥamdu li- llāhi had become established prior to the Qur’an’s\nemergence, presumably among Arabophone Christians, whence it penetrated into wider\nusage (Sinai 2019b, 62). But it should be noted that the root ḥ- m- d is used for praise of a\ndeity already in pre- monotheistic Sabaic inscriptions (e.g., Arbach 1996, 244).5\nḥanīf (li-) | fervently devoted (to God or to worshipping God)\nFurther vocabulary discussed: millah | religion, religious teaching d īn | r eligion, re-\nligious worship m uslim | one who surrenders himself or dedicates himself (to God)\nal- mushrikūn, alladhīna ashrakū pl. | the associators fi ṭrah | creaturely disposition,\ncreaturely constitution\nOverview. The singular ḥanīf and its plural ḥunafāʾ occur in a total of twelve Qur’anic\nverses, both Meccan and Medinan. The word always appears in the accusative and fre-\nquently accompanies references to Abraham or Abraham’s → millah or religious teaching,\neven though this is not the case for what may be the chronologically earliest instance of\nthe term, in Q 30:30 (fa- aqim wajhaka li- l- dīni ḥanīfan, “set your face t owards religion,\nas a ḥanīf”; see KU 56). Q 3:67 makes it particularly clear that the term ḥanīf is a de-\nscriptor applying to Abraham himself: “Abraham was not a Jew or a Christian (mā kāna\nibrāhīmu yahūdiyyan wa- lā naṣrāniyyan); rather, he was a ḥanīf who surrendered himself\nto God (wa- lākin kāna ḥanīfan musliman), and he was no associator (wa- mā kāna mina\nl- mushrikīn).” Q 3:67 also illustrates that the word ḥanīf is often followed by the tail wa- mā\nkāna mina l-m ushrikīn (→ ashraka) or some variant thereof (e.g., an imperative version in\nQ 10:105: “Do not be an associator”).1\n5 I am grateful to Ahmad Al- Jallad for drawing my attention to the inscription at hand.\n1 Luxenberg proposes that what appears to be the accusative ending in the singular ḥanīfan goes back to a mis-\nconstrual of the Syriac emphatic state, such that ibrāhīm ḥanīfan— whose original pronunciation in the mixed Arabic-\n236 ḥanīf", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In Q 22:31, the plural ḥunafāʾ\nis followed by the prepositional object li-l lāhi, “to God.”2 This prepositional usage may\nindicate that the Qur’anic use of ḥanīf is at least tinged by the connotation of inclining\nthat the lexicographic tradition associates with the Arabic root ḥ-n -f : the verbs ḥanafa\nand taḥannafa ilā are parsed as “to incline to s.th.” and ḥanafa/taḥannafa ʿan as “to incline\naway from s.th.” (see, e.g., AEL 658; FVQ 113–114; Sirry 2011, 348).3 The same undertone\nSyriac language posited by Luxenberg would presumably have been something like ibrāhīm ḥanīfā— corresponds, in\nproper Arabic, to ibrāhīm al-ḥ anīf (Luxenberg 2007, 55–56). However, it should be noted that this hypothesis does\nnot fully explain the exclusive appearance of the word in the accusative throughout the Qur’an, as t here are also two\ninstances of the accusative plural (Q 22:31, 98:5). Furthermore, not all occurrences of ḥanīfan follow directly upon\nibrāhīm (Q 3:67, 6:79, 10:105, 16:120, 30:30); and in all of t hese latter cases at least, the presence of the accusative\nmakes grammatical sense in Arabic. Hence, it is doubtful that Luxenberg’s Syriac emendation ḥanīfan > ḥanīfā\nprovides a sufficiently compelling explanation for the w hole gamut of Qur’anic data.\n2 For another case in which ḥanīf figures in close proximity to the preposition li- , see Q 30:30 (fa-a qim\nwajhaka li-l -d īni ḥanīfan, “set your face towards religion, in devotion [to God or his worship]”). In Q 16:120\n(inna ibrāhīma kāna ummatan qānitan li- llāhi ḥanīfan), the preposition li- belongs together with the participle\nof qanata (“to be obedient”); cf. Q 2:116, 3:43, 30:26, 33:31.\n3 Even if ḥanīf is ultimately considered to be a loanword, this does not preclude that the Qur’anic audience\nmay have understood it in light of the established meaning of its Arabic root. See similarly u nder → nabiyy, on\nthe possibility that the Qur’anic recipients associated the loaned noun nabiyy, “prophet,” with the root n- b-ʾ and\nthe verb nabbaʾa, “to announce, to tell.”\nḥanīf 237", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Of course, the fact that neither ḥanafa\nnor taḥannafa occur in the Qur’an gives reason to be cautious about such etymological\nconsiderations. But it does make good contextual sense to assume that the prepositional\ncomplement li- llāhi from Q 22:31 explicates a Godward attitude that is implicit in other\nQur’anic occurrences of ḥanīf and ḥunafāʾ as well. Based on its Qur’anic usage, the term\nḥanīf may thus be supposed to have the approximate significance of being wholly or fer-\nvently devoted to or oriented towards God.\nDoes ḥanīf denote monot hei sm? The tentative gloss just ofered raises the further\nquestion whether we can further specify how ḥanīf- like devotion to God manifests itself.\nA forthcoming study by Mohsen Goudarzi argues that the word ḥanīf denotes in par tic u lar\na “cultic worshipper” of God, meaning “a person who worships God through rites such\nas cultic prayer, sacrifice, and pilgrimage” (Goudarzi, forthcoming). Alternatively, the\ncore meaning of ḥanīf could be located in mono the ism, i.e., the disavowal of any deities\nother than Allāh, an assumption that is prominent in Izutsu’s understanding of the term\nḥanīf (GMK 112; ERCQ 191). While these two aspects are of course compatible, it is clear\nthat the former does not necessarily entail the latter and that engagement in the cult of\na par tic u lar deity, even intense engagement in it, does not as such imply the theological\nclaim that no other deities exist. As Goudarzi notes, his interpretation is strengthened by\nthe fact that several verses containing the term ḥanīf also include the noun → dīn2, which\ndesignates not just religion in general but specifically religious worship (Q 4:125, 6:161,\n10:105, 30:30, 98:5). Moreover, on Goudarzi’s hypothesis, the per sis tent link between the\nword ḥanīf and the figure of Abraham would be readily explicable in so far as a number\nof Qur’anic passages portray Abraham as the founder of the Meccan sanctuary and of the\nrituals performed there (Q 2:125–129, 3:96–97, 22:26–29; cf. also 14:35–41).4 On the other\nhand, the Qur’anic Abraham is equally identified with rigorous mono the ism. While it\nseems difficult to settle the question about the precise connotations of ḥanīf on the basis\nof the Qur’anic data alone, we w ill further below encounter some poetic evidence that\nsupports Goudarzi’s hypothesis.\nThe question whether a ḥanīf is first and foremost someone who is cultically devoted\nto God, perhaps with par tic u lar intensity or ardour, or rather someone who is exclusively\nand credally devoted to him will also have a bearing on how one judges the semantic link\nbetween the word ḥanīf and the frequent addendum mā kāna mina l- mushrikīn, “he was\nno associator.” On the understanding that a ḥanīf is someone who denies other deities,\nthe mā kāna mina l- mushrikīn refrain will be a formulaic pleonasm reinforcing the basic\nmeaning of ḥanīf; in other words, the state of being ḥanīf will be one that is essentially\nopposed to associating other beings with God and to diluting one’s recognition of the\ndeity’s supremacy and sole entitlement to be worshipped. Alternatively, the semantic\nrelationship between the predicate ḥanīf and the ensuing statement wa-m ā kāna mina\nl- mushrikīn might be taken to be not pleonastic but rather synthetic, i.e., the refrain might\nbe understood to add information not already entailed by the word ḥanīf. On this reading,\n4 While I would date the passages from Surahs 2, 3, and 22 to the Medinan period, it seems quite likely to\nme that this material reflects and endorses pre- existing Meccan traditions about a close link between the Kaʿbah\nand Abraham (which do not need to have formed a Meccan consensus, however).

The debate about the meaning of ḥanīf in the Qur’an\nis complicated by the fact that post- Qur’anic sources describe a number of pre-I slamic\nnon- Jewish and non- Christian Arabian mono thei sts as ḥanīfs or as following al-ḥ anīfiyyah,\n“ḥanīfism.” The authenticity of such reports remains controversial, though Rubin has un-\nderscored that some of the individuals are depicted as opponents of Muhammad, which\nin his view makes it unlikely that the material is merely a product of apol o getic invention\n(Rubin 1990; see also Sirry 2011, 362–365). Still, the Qur’an afords no evidence for the\nexistence of an indigenous Arabian mono the istic movement whose members were stan-\ndardly termed ḥanīfs. For instance, a group called al- ḥunafāʾ does not figure in any of\nthe Medinan verses that cata logue the religious communities apparently pre sent in the\nQur’anic environment (Q 2:62, 5:69, 22:17; → al-ṣ ābiʾūn), at least one of which (Q 22:17)\nincludes not only Jews and Christians but also the syncretistic Meccan pagans whom the\nQur’an calls “the associators” (alladhīna ashrakū). As the table above shows, the Qur’an\nemploys ḥanīf and ḥunafāʾ in order to highlight a special quality of devotion to God, a\nvirtue whose importance is impressed upon the Qur’anic Messenger (Q 10:105, 30:30)\nand is said to have been paradigmatically exhibited by Abraham. While it is not unlikely\nthat t here w ere persons in pre- Islamic western Arabia who professed some form of mono-\nthe ism and recognised Abraham as a cultic forebear yet did not affiliate themselves with\nChris tian ity or Judaism, to describe such individuals as committed to al-ḥ anīfiyyah or to\nspeak of them as “the ḥunafāʾ,” as if this w ere an established collective identity, is to step\nbeyond the text of the Qur’an.\nIt is true that in Q 3:67 Abraham’s being a ḥanīf is expressly contrasted with being\nJewish or Christian: “Abraham was not a Jew or a Christian; rather, he was a ḥanīf who\nsurrendered himself to God (kāna ḥanīfan musliman), and he was no associator.” The same\ngoes for Q 2:135: “They say, ‘Be Jews or Christians so that you will be rightly guided.’ No!\n[Follow] the teaching of Abraham, a ḥanīf; he was no associator.”6 These two verses could\nbe taken to mean that being a ḥanīf is as such tantamount to treading a third path distin-\nguished from Judaism and Chris tian ity. However, in both cases it is feasible and indeed\npreferable to read ḥanīf as denoting not a concrete collective affiliation on the same level\nas Judaism or Chris tian ity but rather as helping to convey a general ideal of righ teousness,\nassiduous devotion, and monotheism—an ideal previously embodied by Abraham and\nnow re- enacted by the Qur’anic Prophet and his believing followers, who according to\nQ 3:68 are presently “the people closest to Abraham” (awlā l-n āsi bi-i brāhīma), i.e., those\nwho most fully live up to the ideal exemplified by Abraham. But just as it would not be\nunconceivable for a Jew or a Christian to merit the predicate muslim, or of somebody\n5 On the relationship between the predicate ḥanīf and the ensuing statement wa- mā kāna mina l- mushrikīn,\nsee also Sirry 2011, 353, who suggests that “Muḥammad himself was aware of the fact that ḥanīf could be taken\nto mean ‘heathen,’ and therefore he sought to clear Abraham from such a pos si ble association.” On this reading,\nthe addendum serves to neutralise one pos si ble sense of the word ḥanīf. On ḥanīf and the pos si ble significations\n“heathen, pagan,” see below.\n6 Understanding the accusative millata ibrāhīma to be implicitly governed by the imperative attabiʿ is justi-\nfied in view of other verses that explic itly combine → ittabaʿa and → millah (Q 2:120, 3:95, 4:125, 12:38, 16:123).\nḥanīf 239", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Indeed,\naccording to Q 98:5 “t hose who w ere given the scripture”—i .e., Jews and Christians—w ere\ncommanded to worship God “as ḥanīfs.”7 Further corroboration of this interpretation is\nprovided by Q 30:30, which links the stance of a ḥanīf with conformity to the “God- given\ncreaturely disposition” (fiṭrat allāh) with which humans have been innately endowed by\ntheir creator (allatī faṭara l-n āsa ʿalayhā).8 Devotedly orienting oneself to God, therefore,\nis to realise and fulfil an inherent teleology of human nature; it is not necessarily to join\na concrete community of ḥunafāʾ.9\nBut it may be unwise to carry scepticism about the post- Qur’anic accounts of ḥanīfs\ncont emporary with (and opposed to) Muhammad too far. As we s hall see below, it is quite\nlikely that the word ḥanīf emerged in Arabic prior to the Qur’an. Moreover, if—t aking\ninspiration from, but also some liberty with, Goudarzi’s above- mentioned study—we\nconsider the label ḥanīf to describe a par tic ul ar intensification of ritual practice, especially\nof ritual practices linked to the Meccan sanctuary, then there may well be some kernel\nof truth to reports that certain contemporaries of Muhammad were called, or reportedly\ndescribed themselves, with the attribute ḥanīf. For instance, Rubin cites a poem that Ibn\nIsḥāq attributes to a Medinan opponent of Muhammad called Abū Qays ibn al-A slat, who\nwas allegedly known as al- ḥanīf (Rubin 1990, 90, 91). This poem, after qualifying “our\ndīn” as being ḥanīf, goes on to refer to sacrificial animals, presumably t hose destined to\nbe slaughtered at the Kaʿbah. Other material discussed by Rubin similarly posits a link\nbetween ḥanīf- ness and the Meccan sanctuary. Given that Rubin’s main source is the sīrah\nlit er a ture, it is impossible to rule out that the Qur’anic label ḥanīf is here being applied\nretrospectively and that the poetry cited is pseudoepigraphic. But even so, it is conceivable\nthat the rituals performed at and around the Meccan sanctuary could have led, in some\npeople, to an intensification of religious practice that was perhaps inspired by, and sought\nto rival, the ascetic commitment of Christian holy men; it is notable that one of Muham-\nmad’s alleged ḥanīfī opponents, the Medinan Abū ʿĀmir, is said to have worn hair shirts\nand to have been called “the hermit” (al- rāhib; Rubin 1990, 87). An ascetically minded\nintensification of cultic worship in the Meccan milieu is also suggested by post- Qur’anic\ntraditions to the efect that certain individuals, including but not l imited to Muhammad,\nused to withdraw into solitude atop Mount Ḥirāʾ near Mecca for certain periods of time,\nthe main Arabic term used being the verb taḥannatha or its corresponding noun (Kister\n1968). Such intensification of ritual practice may well have gone hand in hand with a\n7 This is not to deny that during Muhammad’s Medinan period the Qur’anic community was increasingly\nviewed as a religious denomination that was distinct from Judaism and Chris tian ity (HCI 200–202), a devel-\nopment that is clearly documented by the fact that Q 2:62, 5:69, and 22:17 list the Qur’anic “believers” besides\na number of other religious communities, such as Jews, Christians, and the enigmatic → ṣābiʾūn. Indeed, that\nthe Qur’anic community was separate from Judaism and Christ ian ity is also reflected by the reference to “this\nProphet and t hose who believe” in Q 3:68, following immediately upon one of the occurrences of ḥanīf cited at\nthe beginning of the paragraph. My point in the main text is therefore simply that the communal separateness\nof the Qur’anic believers, though inferable from some Qur’anic data, is not entailed by the meaning of ḥanīf.\n8 As recognised already by Nöldeke (NB 49), Arabic fiṭrah corresponds to Ethiopic fәṭrat, whose meanings\ninclude not only “creation” but also “nature, character, disposition, constitution” (Leslau 1991, 172).\n9 To avoid misunderstanding, it may be added that Q 30:30 does not entail that humans will instinctively\ngravitate towards mono the ism if left to their own devices, for the Qur’an also posits a contrary tendency to be\nforgetful of God (→ nasiya) and to fall into the cardinal sin of associating (→ ashraka) other beings with him;\nthe Qur’anic understanding of human nature is decidedly conflictual.\n240 ḥanīf", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As intimated above,\nthe word ḥanīf as such does not seem to be a Qur’anic coinage. This is suggested by Hor-\novitz’s overview of a small number of poetic prooftexts that had been identified by the\n1920s (KU 56–59).10 The most impor tant ones are two occurrences in the poetic corpus\nof the Banū Hudhayl. First, a poem attributed to Ṣakhr al- Ghayy (Sezgin 1975, 144–145)\ncompares a rain cloud to “carousing Christians” (naṣārā yusāqawna) who come across a\nḥanīf in the desert (RAH 239; Grimme 1892, 13; NB 30; KU 57; for the verse, refer to Farrāj\nand Shākir 1963–1965, 297 = Ṣakhr al- Ghayy and Abū l- Muthallam, no. 17:11). As Faris and\nGlidden insightfully comment (Faris and Glidden 1975, 258): “What the poet sought to\ndo was to convey the contrast between the moist, rain-l aden cloud (the ‘wet’ Christians)\nand the parched plain (the ‘dry’ ḥanīf).” To be sure, Faris and Glidden class the verse with\na number of other instances in early Arabic poetry up u ntil the early Islamic period in\nwhich ḥanīf stands in opposition to “Christian.” Yet it is not evident that the verse at hand\nmust employ ḥanīf in the sense of “pagan” or “non- Christian,” for the opposition that Faris\nand Glidden persuasively discern in the verse w ill be at least as efective if ḥanīf is taken\nto mean “ascetic”: even if early Arabic poetry associates Christians with wine (as already\nobserved in Grimme 1892, 13), this hardly means that all non- Christians were considered\nto be teetotallers. It would be more apposite, therefore, to contrast wine- drinking ordinary\nChristians with holy men abstaining from vari ous pleasures and comforts, including wine.\nThis line of thought aligns with the understanding of Wellhausen, Nöldeke, and Horovitz,\nwho are all to some degree inclined to consider ḥanīf to refer to an ascetic h ere. By way of\na supplementary consideration, it is worth drawing attention once more to Muhammad’s\nalleged opponent Abū ʿĀmir, whom post- Qur’anic sources both class as a ḥanīf and report\nto have been called “the hermit” (al- rāhib); what ever one makes of the historicity of this\nmaterial, it indicates a certain proximity between the two words.\nThe same supposition that ḥanīf means “hermit, ascetic” also fits another Hudhalī poem,\nby Abū Dhuʾayb (d. c. 649). It opens by evoking the former abode of his love interest Umm\nal- Rahīn, where she used to reside “in the manner of a ḥanīf during the two months of\nJumādā and the two months of Ṣafar” (Farrāj and Shākir 1963–1965, 112–113 = Abū Dhuʾayb,\nno. 9:3; see again RAH 239; NB 30; KU 57).11 Grimme maintains that ḥanīf can be interpreted\nas “pagan” or “heathen” in both Hudhalī prooftexts (Grimme 1892, 13),12 but especially with\nregard to the one by Abū Dhuʾayb this cannot be accepted. Umm al-R ahīn’s former abode\nis an idyllic desert pasture in temporary bloom: she has erected a tent by a river of fresh\nwater (v. 2) and she is said to have a special preference for “the milk of the [camels] grazing\n10 For an opposing voice, see Rudolph 1922, 70–71, who doubts the probative force of the poetic evidence.\n11 The “two months of Ṣafar” are Muḥarram and Ṣafar; they stand for the autumn (RAH 95–97).\n12 This may also be the opinion of de Blois, who maintains that “all the genuinely pre-I slamic attestations\nof ḥanīf in Arabic poetry” can be interpreted to mean “pagan,” although he does not discuss any of the relevant\nprooftexts in detail (de Blois 2002, 19).\nḥanīf 241", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, both Hudhalī verses support the\nassumption that the term ḥanīf could be applied to “a person of a certain religious standing”\n(NB 30), i.e., to someone displaying a noteworthy or unusual degree of religious devotion,\nas manifested by solitary withdrawal into the wilderness and by abstention from wine.\nThe general impression is that the figure of the ḥanīf in the two Hudhalī poems is of a\npiece with other allusions to Christian hermits and holy men in pre- Islamic poetry (see\nthe summary remarks on attestations of the word rāhib under → al- naṣārā). Perhaps some\npre- Islamic speakers of Arabic understood the term ḥanīf in an etymologising sense as\nsomeone who had “turned” towards God or away from society. While Wellhausen thinks\nthat the word may originally have signified a Christian holy man in par tic u lar (RAH 239–\n240), calling somebody a ḥanīf in the sense of a hermit or ascetic may not have entailed\nstressing a par tic ul ar communal affiliation, given that pre-I slamic poetry does not generally\nexhibit much interest in the beliefs of the hermits or ascetics it occasionally invokes. What\nis particularly noteworthy at this point is that both poetic attestations just discussed sup-\nport the idea that the label ḥanīf refers first and foremost to an intensification of religious\npractice, w hether or not such intensification was underpinned by a doctrinal commitment\nto mono the ism. Thus, one can see how cultic devotion may have included withdrawal to\nand residence at a specific place, as per the poem by Abū Dhuʾayb. (It is immaterial in this\ncontext whether such withdrawal reflected the intrinsic holiness of the place in question\nor was simply a way of leaving b ehind human society.) Ḥanīf-l ike devotion to God could\nalso have involved a permanent or periodic observation of certain dietary taboos, such\nas abstention from wine in the poem by Ṣakhr al- Ghayy. A ḥanīf, then, is somebody who\nis intensely “into” religion, by subjecting his or her behaviour to cultic prescriptions and\nlimitations that are not followed by ordinary persons. In this sense, poetry backs Goudarzi’s\nhypothesis as summarised above (although it must be said that Goudarzi himself does not\noperate with the notion of intensification).14\nA dif er ent use of the word ḥanīf is exemplified by an exclamation that al- Mubarrad\nand others attribute to a dying Christian, in which ḥanīf must mean “pagan” or “apostate,”\nin opposition to “Christian” (Grimme 1892, 12–13; NB 30; KU 57; for the text, see Wright\n1874–1892, 1:131, l. 4). Faris and Glidden pre sent additional material from early Islamic po-\netry in which ḥanīf stands in opposition to “Christian” (Faris and Glidden 1975, 257–258).15\nSuch a use of the word fits the fact that ḥanīf is most likely etymologically derived from\nSyriac ḥanpā, “gentile, heathen” (SL 473), an etymological hypothesis voiced as early as\nal- Masʿūdī (de Blois 2002, 20, and Sirry 2011, 346; on the word’s Syriac origin, see also NB\n30 and FVQ 115). Specifically, one may imagine the singular ḥanīf to have arisen by way of\n“a back-f ormation from the plural ḥunafāʾ, which, for its part, could represent a borrowing\nof the Aramaic plural ḥanpē, remodelled to fit a regular Arabic plural pattern” (de Blois\n2002, 23, crediting Bell 1953, 12; see already Bell 1930, 120–121).\n13 Note that Wellhausen, Grimme, Nöldeke, and Horovitz’s acquaintance with this verse was still confined\nto its decontextualised quotation in the lexicographic lit er a ture, such as the Lisān al-ʿ arab. It was only with Hell\n1926, published in the same year as KU, that the entire poem became accessible to Eu ro pean scholars.\n14 I am grateful to Goudarzi for helping me see the link between the poetic evidence and his hypothesis.\n15 As noted above, Faris and Gliden would assign the verse by Ṣakhr al- Ghayy speaking of Christians en-\ncountering a ḥanīf to the same category.\n242 ḥanīf", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

While the preceding derivation\nis very plausible from an etymological perspective, it does require the term ḥanīf to have\nunder gone significant semantic development: an Arabic word that has a markedly positive\nsense in the Qur’an, and to some degree also in the two verses from the Hudhalī dīwān\ndiscussed above, turns out to be descended from a Syriac word that often has a distinct\npejorative ring (“heathen”), even if it can also serve as a more neutral and descriptive\nclassifier (“gentile”).16 A pos si ble account for how this semantic development might have\noccurred has been put forward in a much- quoted article by François de Blois (de Blois\n2002, 20–25). De Blois notes that Paul, in a seminal passage of the Epistle to the Romans,\nunderscores that Abraham was considered righ teous and faithful by God before undergo-\ning circumcision, thus demonstrating that Abraham was justified not through the law but\nthrough faith (Rom 4; see already Margoliouth 1903, 478–479, and FVQ 115; cf. Luxenberg\n2007, 56–57). From this, it could have been inferred that Abraham was a righ teous and\ndevoted believer already while being a gentile or a ḥanpā, and in fact de Blois identifies a\npassage in a Syriac life of Clement of Rome that states explic itly that “Abraham believed in\nGod while still being a ḥanpā” (Mingana 1917, 34, ll. 12–13 of Syriac text; see the translation\non p. 10). While de Blois carefully avoids committing himself to any specific dating of this\nSyriac text, it is plausible to surmise that the figure of Abraham may have functioned as\nan associative pivot facilitating the word’s shift from meaning “pagan” to meaning some-\nthing like “devoted to God in an exemplary fashion.”17 If so, the link between the epithet\nḥanīf and the figure of Abraham would not be a Qur’anic innovation but rather would\ndocument a pre- Qur’anic context of usage, very likely Christian, for which we other wise\nhave no direct Arabic evidence. The development may have been facilitated by the use of\nḥanpā to signify a “gentile candidate for salvation in Christ” that is occasionally found in\nthe Peshitta, e.g., in Acts 18:4, where Paul preaches to “Jews and gentiles” (de Blois 2002,\n21–22, 24). At the same time, as we saw above, the Qur’anic use of ḥanīf has prob ably also\nbeen “semantically enriched” by the indigenous Arabic meaning of Arabic ḥanafa ilā, “to\nincline to s.th.” (Sirry 2011, 352).\nThere is one loose end in this scenario that remains to be tied up. In the Hudhalī proof-\ntexts discussed above, the semantic focus of ḥanīf would seem to be the notion of an\nabove- average degree of piety and cultic devotion, and the same goes for what may be the\nword’s earliest Qur’anic occurrence in Q 30:30; in neither case do we find an explicit link\nto Abraham, as de Blois’s hypothesis might lead one to expect. One could, however, make\nthe auxiliary assumption that once ḥanīf had established itself as a label for righ teousness\nand pious devotion to God, due to its postulated link with Abraham, ḥanīf could serve\nas an approximate synonym of rāhib. This would have made the word available to mean\n“recluse,” “hermit,” “ascetic,” as attested by Hudhalī poetry. By contrast, the majority of\n16 See already Rudolph 1922, 70, n. 42. De Blois puts the issue thus: the Qur’anic use of the word ḥanīf\nconfronts us with “the dilemma that a word which in some Arabic contexts is used to mean ‘pagan,’ and which\nis manifestly cognate with words having similarly negative connotations in other Semitic languages, is, in the\nQur an, used to qualify the patriarch Abraham and other followers of the true religion” (de Blois 2002, 20).\n17 The markedly formulaic manner in which the Qur’anic employs ḥanīf in connection with Abraham fol-\nlowed by the mā kāna mina l-m ushrikīn refrain invites the conjecture that the Qur’an has recourse to a pre- existent\nstock phrase about Abraham here. However, the theory does not easily cohere with the likely Jewish origin of\nthe Qur’anic use of the verb → ashraka to refer to the worship of Gods other than Allāh. This strengthens the\nalternative hypothesis that the formula only emerged during the Qur’an’s genesis.\nḥanīf 243", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

An equivalent conjecture may be voiced with regard to Zoroastrian eschatology:\nas Evgenii Berthels has pointed out, the Avestan Hādōkht nask describes how the soul of the\nfaithful w ill posthumously encounter his daēnā—t he personification of his earthly deeds—\nin the shape of a beautiful maiden of fifteen (Berthels 1925; see also Minov 2016, 160, and\nDavitashvili 2021, 20–22, who helpfully references König 2010, 118).3 It is not inconceivable,\nthough hardly certain, that this idea, refracted through the prism of popu lar traditions that\nare not available to us anymore, could have morphed into a parallel of the Qur’anic prom-\nise that the virtuous will be eschatologically rewarded with supremely attractive mates.\nInterestingly, Minov surmises that the erotic undertones of some of Ephrem’s statements\nabout paradise may themselves have an Ira nian background (Minov 2016, 160). However,\neven though one Medinan verse cursorily mentions “the Magians” (al- majūs; Q 22:17) and\neven though Qur’anic Arabic has quite a few loanwords that can be traced back to Middle\nPersian (e.g., → dīn2), often for items of material culture (see generally Cheung 2017), it\nremains to be corroborated by future research whether Zoroastrian traditions should be\ncredited with a direct impact on the Qur’an. For example, the Avestan- descended angelic\nnames hārūt and mārūt in the Medinan verse Q 2:102 seem to have reached the Qur’an\nvia the waystation of Jewish magic (QP 194–196). The current lack of Qur’anic evidence\nfor direct contact with Zoroastrianism does not increase the likelihood that the Qur’anic\nmaidens of paradise are to be placed against a Zoroastrian background.\nOn the meaning of ḥūr ʿīn. A total of four Qur’anic verses (Q 44:54, 52:20, 55:72,\n56:22) describe the female mates of the inhabitants of paradise as ḥūr or ḥūr ʿīn (hence\n“houris”). The plural adjective ʿīn (singular: aʿyan, ʿaynāʾ) means “wide- eyed” (AEL 2218).\nMore problematic is ḥūr (singular: aḥwar, ḥawrāʾ), another female epithet in the Qur’an\nfor which poetry ofers parallels (Davitashvili 2021, 59–60). The word is generally linked\nwith the idea of whiteness and is usually understood to describe a feature of someone’s\neyes, namely, an intense contrast of black and white (AEL 666; CDKA 80). Yet Wendell\nand Davitashvili note that the attribute ḥūr may also refer to a white complexion of the\nskin (Wendell 1974, 35–41; Davitashvili 2021, 36–38), expressing an “insistence on the\nquality of ‘whiteness’ as a desirable, and desired, attribute of the beauty, male or female”\n(Wendell 1974, 35). Indeed, al- Azharī stipulates that “a woman is not called ḥawrāʾ unless\nin addition to exhibiting an intense contrast of black and white in her eyes the skin of\nher body is also white” (al- Azharī [1964–1976], 5:229).4 There is, moreover, compelling\npoetic evidence that a fair complexion, described by derivatives of the root b- y-ḍ (abyaḍ,\nbayḍāʾ, bīḍ), was esteemed as a marker of aristocratic status; and it is mostly pos si ble to\nunderstand poetic verses employing derivatives of ḥ- w- r to have this sense, too.

In Q 2:7, 6:46, 42:24, and 45:23,\nGod is said to set a seal (khatama), or to be able to set a seal, on h uman hearts. Given\nthat the Qur’an considers the heart to be the seat of conscious thought and pro cessing\n(→ qalb), this means that God incapacitates the ability of h umans to ponder and reflect,\nthe result being that “it is the same to them w hether you warn them or do not warn them;\nthey do not believe” (Q 2:6). In many cases, references to divine incapacitation of the\nheart are accompanied by incapacitation of the two principal senses of sight and hearing.\nThus, in Q 45:23 the patient’s hearing figures as a second object of khatama, while the\norgan of sight is said to be put under a “covering” (ghishāwah), as in 2:7, and 6:46 has the\nsame triad of heart, hearing, and sight (“If God takes away yourp hearing and your sight\nand puts a seal on your hearts,” in akhadha llāhu samʿakum wa- abṣārakum wa- khatama\nʿalā qulūbikum). Other verses describe God’s sealing of human hearts by employing the\nverb ṭabaʿa, in one case again with the triad heart, hearing, and sight: ulāʾika alladhīna\nṭabaʿa llāhu ʿalā qulūbihim wa- samʿihim wa- abṣārihim, “ those are the ones upon whose\nhearts, hearing, and eyes God has set a seal” (Q 16:108; see also 4:155, 7:100.101, 9:87.93,\n10:74 etc.).1 God’s incapacitation of the senses of hearing and sight is plainly not meant to\nindicate literal blindness and deafness but rather a lack of rational responsiveness to and\ncomprehension of the perceptual data that these two senses deliver to the heart (see also\nunder → samiʿa and → ʿamiya).\nBiblical precursors. The motif of divine blockage of heart, vision, and hearing is\nreminiscent of Biblical verses reporting God’s hardening of the hearts of Phar aoh, his of-\nficials, and the Egyptian army pursuing the Israelites through the sea (Exod 4:21, 7:3, 9:12,\n10:1.20.27, 11:10, 14:4.8.17; see Räisänen 1976, 52–56). A number of Qur’anic verses similarly\nspeak of a hardening of human hearts, e.g., Q 5:13 with regard to the Israelites (wa- jaʿalnā\n1 The triad appears in Q 7:179 as well; see additionally 22:46. God’s incapacitating impact on h uman hearts\nis also described as an act of covering (Q 6:25, 17:46, 18:57: wa- jaʿalnā / innā jaʿalnā ʿalā qulūbihim akinnatan;\nsee also 41:5). As Seidensticker notes, Q 9:87 and 63:3 have the passive ṭubiʿa, but it is clear that God is to be\nunderstood as the agent (AHW 75).\n248", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

An even\ncloser parallel to the Qur’anic statements about divine sealing surveyed above is Isa 6:9–10\n(Katsh 1954, 15), which features the same triad of hearts, ears, and eyes that is found in\nQ 2:7, 6:46, 16:108, and 45:23: “Go and say to this people: ‘Hear, but do not comprehend;\nsee, but do not understand.’ // Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,\nand blind their eyes, so that they may not see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,\nand comprehend with their hearts, and turn and be healed.”2 The passage is cited several\ntimes in the New Testament, such as Matt 13:14–15 (see also Mark 4:11, Luke 8:10, John\n12:40, and Acts 28:26–27; cf. also Rom 11:8; see CQ 162, AHW 183–184, and Koloska 2020,\n40–41). In addition, it reverberates in l ater Christian texts like the Didascalia Apostolorum\n(Vööbus 1979, 161 and 246; see Zellentin 2013, 147, n. 26).3\nWhile the Qur’anic triad of hearing, seeing, and the heart evidently has a Biblical\nresonance, the Qur’an’s formulaic recourse to the meta phor of God’s “sealing” (ṭabaʿa,\nkhatama) of the hearts and senses of unbelievers is distinctive. The Islamic scripture cer-\ntainly deploys the notion of sealing in a very dif er ent manner than, e.g., Song of Songs\n8:6 (“Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm”). Especially the Christian\ntradition accords a markedly positive valence to the notion of divine sealing, which is\noften used as a meta phor for baptism.4 For instance, 2 Cor 1:21–22, which states that God\nhas “anointed us by putting his seal on us and giving us his spirit in our hearts,” provides\na tangible contrast to the Qur’an’s consistently negative deployment of the notion of\ndivine heart-s ealing.5 Ahrens claims to have identified a Syriac parallel in a passage from\nJohn of Ephesus (Land 1868, 2:172, l. 12, and 2:128, l. 1 = Brooks 1923, 230, l. 1, and 231,\nll. 1–2; see CQ 47). Yet while the statement “Our heart is ṭbīʿ ” does indeed make use of\nan adjective that is cognate with Qur’anic ṭabaʿa, Syriac ṭbaʿ can also mean “to sink, to\nbe immersed” and not only “to seal” (see SL 511). The second one of Ahrens’s two occur-\nrences in fact makes it clear that the intended meaning must be “Our heart is sunk” (thus\n2 For a brief analy sis of this passage, see Räisänen 1976, 58–63. Another Biblical pre ced ent for the same triad\nis Jer 5:21 (Reynolds 2018, 32), where the prophet is instructed to declare, “Hear this, O foolish and senseless\npeople, who have eyes, but do not see, who have ears, but do not hear”; this is followed, in v. 23, by the accusa-\ntion, “But this people has a stubborn and rebellious heart; they have turned aside and gone away.” However, as\nnoted in Räisänen 1976, 62, God h ere does not figure as the cause of p eople’s inability to see and hear. See also\nIsa 42:20, 43:8, 44:18.\n3 Note that in the latter case Isa 6:9–10 is combined with the motif of the hardening of Pha raoh’s heart\nfrom Exodus.\n4 For general overviews of the sealing meta phor in Biblical, early Christian, and Manichaean lit er a ture,\nsee Stroumsa 1986, 63–69; see also TDNT 7:939–953. The Pauline letters are noticeably fond of the notion of\nsealing. See, for instance, Rom 4:11 (Abraham was circumcised as “a seal of the righ teousness that he had by\nfaith while he was still uncircumcised”), and Eph 1:13 (in Christ the addressees “ were sealed with the promised\nHoly Spirit“) and 4:30 (the addressees are sealed in the Holy Spirit); see also Rom 15:28, 1 Cor 9:2, 2 Cor 1:21–22\n(cited in the main text), and 2 Tim 2:19. For a scatter of later Christian invocations of the meta phor of sealing, see\nBeck 1959, no. 1:99; Schaf and Wace 1995, 1:151.253.556, corresponding to Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History, books\n3:23:8 and 6:5:6 (Eusebius 1926–1932, 1:244–245 and 2:26–27) and to Eusebius, Life of Constantine, book 4:62;\nSchaf and Wace 1995, 10:103.112.141.370–371 (Ambrose). There is a loose Manichaean parallel to the Qur’anic\nnotion of heart-s ealing, mentioned by Augustine: signaculum sinus, “the seal of the bosom,” but it “symbolizes the\nencratism of the Manichaean elects, their prohibition of wedding and sexual relations” (Stroumsa 1986, 67–68,\nwho also cites another Manichaean text— equally irrelevant for Qur’anic purposes—t hat combines references\nto sealing and “our hearts”).\n5 On Q 33:40, which calls Muhammad the “seal of the prophets” and thus employs the concept of sealing\nin an eminently positive sense, see below.\nkhatama 249", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an’s\nemployment of the meta phor of heart-s ealing raises the question w hether it has deterministic\nor predestinarian implications. Does God, by some arbitrary and inscrutable decree, render\nsome h umans incapable of responding to his guidance and then punish them for something\nthey are fundamentally unable to help? While a predestinarian reading of the Qur’an is not\ngrotesque, t here are ultimately impor tant considerations that militate against it, as shown in\nmore detail elsewhere (see u nder → shāʾa and → hadā). As regards specifically the notion of\nheart-s ealing, al- Ṭabarī interprets it to indicate God’s final confirmation of a deficient moral\nstate resulting from copious prior wrongdoings, thereby locking a person in sinfulness and\nunbelief without any prospect of moral or epistemic reform (Ṭab. 1:266–267). Thus con-\nstrued, God’s sealing of a person’s heart amounts to preventing an individual with a flagrantly\nnegative moral or religious track rec ord from any future characterial betterment: God’s\nsealing of someone’s heart is a consequence of a prior turning away from God rather than its\noriginal cause.6 A similarly consequentalist understanding of the meta phor is put forward by\nal-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī, according to whom God’s sealing of h uman hearts conveys “the sort\nof prevention”—of f uture change, we may supply—“ that occurs when books or chapters are\nsealed” (mā yaḥṣulu mina l-m anʿi bi- l- khatmi ʿalā l- kutubi wa- l- abwāb; al- Rāghib al- Iṣfahānī\n2009, 275).7 What both attempts at parsing the meta phor have in common is that God’s\nsealing of an unbelievers’ heart is viewed as the culminating point in a negative moral and\nreligious trajectory at which the latter becomes irreversibly fixed. Sealing, in other words,\nfollows prior misdeeds (thus also Mir 1987, 193–194).\nThere is good inner- Qur’anic support for such an interpretation of divine heart- sealing\nas “a consequence rather than a cause” (SQ 16; see already Goldziher 1910, 93–94, and\nRahman 2009, 19–20). Q 4:155 reports the Israelites’ alleged utterance that their hearts are\n“wrapped in foreskins” (→ ghulf) and then announces that God has set a seal on their hearts\n“on account of their repudiation” (bi- kufrihim). The phrase bi- kufrihim makes it clear that\nthe Israelites’ unbelief precedes God’s final sealing up of their hearts.8 Also pertinent is\nQ 40:35, according to which God “sets a seal on the hearts of arrogant oppressors” (yaṭbaʿu\nllāhu ʿalā kulli qalbi mutakabbirin jabbār); here, too, one understands that it is only a fter\nsomebody has shown himself or herself to be an arrogant oppressor that his/her heart is\nsealed (see similarly Q 7:101 and 10:74). The same causal sequence recurs with regard to\nother terms used for God’s incapacitation of h uman hearts. Thus, according to Q 2:10 some\npeople have “a sickness in their hearts,” upon which God “increases them in sickness”\n6 It is impor tant to highlight that this understanding of the sealing meta phor does not necessarily imply that\nGod will not hold h umans to account for something that is beyond their capability; indeed, al- Ṭabarī explic itly\nconsiders the Qur’an to endorse the doctrine of taklīf mā lā yuṭāqu here, i.e., of moral responsibility for actions\nthat are beyond an individual’s ability: an unbeliever who is sealed in his rejection of God’s message is not thereby\nexcused from the obligation to heed it and will be punished accordingly (Ṭab. 1:268–269).\n7 Expressing himself in Aristotelian terms, al-R āghib takes the sealing meta phor to indicate that “when a\nhuman reaches the utmost degree of unsound belief and forbidden actions . . . , this endows him with a habitual\nstate accustoming him to approve of acts of disobedience, and it is as if a seal has been set upon his heart.” The\nnaturalistic flavour of this comment is palpably at odds with al- Ṭabarī, who is unequivocal that the sealing is an\nact of God rather than an act of the unbelievers (Ṭab. 1:268).\n8 The only other place in the Qur’an that cites the qulūbunā ghulfun phrase, Q 2:88, follows it with a very\nsimilar condemnation yet substitutes God’s sealing of the Israelites’ hearts by his cursing of them for their repu-\ndiation (laʿanahumu llāhu bi- kufrihim).\n250 khatama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As Heikki Räisänen has demon-\nstrated in a comprehensive study, it is plausible to extend a consequentalist reading to\nnumerous other Qur’anic references to God’s leading astray of, or hardening the hearts of,\nhumans (Räisänen 1976, 13–44; see already Goldziher 1910, 91–94), since the Qur’an often\nsignals that “t hose led astray by God have deserved this fate” (Räisänen 1976, 24). Many of\nthe Qur’an’s more ambiguous statement on the issue are therefore defensibly read in light\nof statements implying a consequentialist position.\nFi nally, a consequentialist understanding of divine heart- sealing in the Qur’an is also\nhistorically likely, since it is in line with Christian and Jewish attempts to construe Biblical\nstatements about the hardening of Phar aoh’s heart in a non- deterministic manner, thereby\nsafeguarding human free will (see the brief discussion of select Greek, Latin, and Syriac\nauthors in Langston 2006, 86). For instance, Ephrem takes advantage of the fact that the\nBiblical account of the ten plagues does not always explic itly name God as the agent who\ncaused Pha raoh’s heart to harden (Ephrem 1955, 135, 137 = Ephrem 1994, 238–239, 241,\ncommenting on Exod 7:14 and 8:15; see also Schmid, forthcoming a). A similarly non-\ndeterministic reading, justified by means of the same textual observation, is found in the\nmidrashic tradition, namely, in Exodus Rabbah (Shinan 1984, 243 = ch. 11:6) and Midrash\nTanḥuma (Wā- ērāʾ 3): after the fifth plague, God decides that he will henceforth preclude\nany f uture possibility of remorse, and accordingly the Biblical text from now on employs\nthe active formulation “the Lord hardened Pha raoh’s heart” (Exod 9:12, 10:20, 10:27,\n14:8).9 It would appear that the Qur’an, like late antique Jewish and Christian readers of\nthe Bible but unlike some strands of post- Qur’anic Islamic theology, presupposes at least\nsome degree of human free will.\nTo be sure, the Islamic scripture does sometimes employ language with a markedly\npredestinarian or deterministic ring, which is not always easy to explain away. For in-\nstance, Q 17:16 depicts God as inciting par tic u lar humans to sin, thus providing him with\nwhat may appear as little more than a pretext for the punitive obliteration of an entire\ncity: “When we want to destroy a town, we command its affluent inhabitants to sin in it\n(amarnā mutrafīhā fa- fasaqū fīhā); then the word comes true against it (fa- ḥaqqa ʿalayhā\nl- qawlu) and we completely destroy it.” But even h ere, one might go on to ask why it is\nthat God would “want” to destroy a town if not on account of its preceding moral and\nreligious lapses. This line of thought is supported by the observation that the word mutraf\nhas consistently negative connotations in the Qur’an: it does not merely describe economic\nprosperity, but rather designates someone whose indulgence in a life of affluence has had\na corrosive impact on his moral and religious integrity. Thus, “ those spoilt by affluence,”\n9 As so often in the case of rabbinic lit er a ture, a pre- Qur’anic dating of both works as a whole is uncertain;\nboth may well have under gone their final editing in the Islamic period (see Stemberger 1996, 305–306 and\n308–309; Bregman 2003; Graves 2011, 8, n. 32). Bregman 2003, 142–143 (Hebrew section), maintains that the\nversion of the tradition that is preserved in Exodus Rabbah is earlier than that in Midrash Tanḥuma, which de-\nvelops the former into a general rule that is not entirely accurate (namely, that all of the first five plagues have\nthe passive and all of the second five plagues have the active).\nkhatama 251", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The aptness\nof the traditional construal of Q 33:40 as expressing the finality of Muhammad’s mission\nhas been questioned by a considerable number of Western scholars (e.g., KU 53; see\nin more detail Rubin 2014a). Extra- Qur’anic evidence indicates that khatama could be\nused in early Arabic to mean confirmation without a connotation of finality and that\nsome early interpreters of Q 33:40 did not take the verse to entail that Muhammad was\nthe last prophet (Friedmann 1986). From this one might infer that the point of Q 33:40\nis merely to highlight that Muhammad’s preaching agrees with and corroborates that of\nearlier prophets, a claim that the Qur’an frequently makes by using the term muṣaddiq,\n“confirming” (→ ṣaddaqa). Within the Qur’an, however, the act of sealing (khatama)\nis plausibly understood to imply closure (CDKA 83 and Rubin 2014a, 74–76). Thus, in\naddition to the material reviewed above, Q 36:65 says that on the day of judgement God\nwill “seal” the mouths of the sinners, leaving them unable to speak except by their hands.11\nIt is also arguable that the unique assertion in Q 33:40 that Muhammad is the “seal of\nthe prophets” is likely to mean something above and beyond the much more frequent\nQur’anic statements that he or one of his forerunners are “confirmers” (muṣaddiq) of their\npre de ces sors (Rubin 2014a, 74), a claim attested from the early Meccan period onwards\n(Q 37:37). It is accordingly quite pos si ble and even probable that Q 33:40 does indeed\npre sent Muhammad as the last prophet. This would fit the general tendency of Surah\n33 to exalt Muhammad’s status, a thrust that is particularly manifest in Q 33:7, where\nMuhammad heads an other wise chronological list of prophets from Noah to Jesus (HCI\n209). In addition, as we shall see forthwith, the putative use of the sealing meta phor to\nconnote finality in Q 33:40 has Biblical pre ce dent.\n10 Another verse that may seem to undermine the consequentialist position is Q 9:127. It describes how\nwhen “a surah is sent down,” some members of the Qur’anic audience “turn away” (inṣarafū), and then adds that\n“God has turned away their hearts b ecause they are a p eople who do not understand” (ṣarafa llāhu qulūbahum\nbi-a nnahum qawmun lā yafqahūn). This is plausibly read as presenting God’s transitive “turning away” of the\naddressees’ hearts as the cause, rather than a consequence, of their intransitive “turning away” from the Qur’anic\nrevelations. An alternative interpretation would be to construe ṣarafa llāhu qulūbahum . . . a s an imprecation: “May\nGod turn away their hearts!” (e.g., Zam. 3:110; see also SQ 541). Yet a more promising way of reconciling Q 9:127\nwith the consequentialist evidence set out in the main text is to emphasise the continuation of the ṣarafa llāhu\nqulūbahum phrase: God has “turned their hearts away” on account of and in response to the fact that they did not\npreviously show themselves capable of “understanding” (bi-a nnahum qawmun lā yafqahūn). The final clause of\nthe verse thus restates the same consequentialist nexus that one finds elsewhere in the Qur’an.\n11 Colpe, however, thinks that the meaning of kh- t- m in Q 33:40 does not conform to Qur’anic usage else-\nwhere (Colpe 1984–1986, 72). There is, of course, the undeniable diference that Q 33:40 employs the notion of\nsealing in a positive rather than an ominous sense; but it is not implausible that under lying this diference is a\nbasic semantic unity to the Qur’anic use of the verb khatama and the noun khātam.\n252 khatama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

First, Muslim authors such\nas al- Bīrūnī report that Mani was called the “seal of the prophets” (KU 53–54; Stroumsa\n1986, 62–63). Yet this may well be a retrojection of Qur’anic terminology (Stroumsa 1986;\nColpe 1984–1986, 74–76).12 Secondly, the Samaritan Memar Marqah or Tibat Marqe calls\nMoses the “seal of the prophets” (Fossum 1993, 151–152, citing Macdonald 1963, 1:123 and\n2:201 = Memar Marqah 5:3, corresponding to Ben- Ḥayyim 1988, 318 and 319 = end of fol.\n259b). This expresses the Samaritan denial of any prophets a fter Moses and thus utilises\nthe expression in the same sense of finality that is operative in Q 33:40. Unfortunately,\nthe dating of the dif er ent parts of Tibat Marqe is not certain (see generally Hjelm 2016).\nIts Hebrew editor and translator estimates that books 3–6 were composed at some point\nbetween the sixth and tenth centuries CE, as they contain “linguistic ele ments which seem\nto have been influenced or even are directly borrowed from Arabic” (Ben- Ḥayyim 1988,\nv). In keeping with this, a footnote by Ben- Ḥayyim explic itly identifies the application of\nthe title “seal of the prophets” to Moses as having been transferred from Muhammad to\nMoses (Ben-Ḥ ayyim 1988, 318). It seems safest to follow this cautionary approach.\nGiven the elimination of these two close parallels, the only thing that can currently\nbe said about the background of the Qur’anic “seal of the prophets” title is that it was\nprob ably redolent of Christian language describing Christ as “sealing”— i.e., both fulfilling\nand closing of— the succession of prophets who foretold his appearance, based on Dan\n9:24’s reference to the “sealing” of “vision and prophet” (laḥtōm ḥāzôn wә-n ābîʾ), which\nChristian interpreters applied to Jesus (Colpe 1984–1986, 76–79). In par tic u lar, Colpe\ndraws attention to a passage by Tertullian (Adversos Iudaeos 8; see Roberts et al. 1995,\n3:160), who links Dan 9:24 to Christ and accordingly describes the latter as “the seal of\nall the prophets” (signaculum omnium prophetarum; Colpe 1984–1986, 77–79). Colpe’s\nsuggestion that Q 33:40 repurposes Christian language should not be dismissed due to\nthe geographic and linguistic distance separating Tertullian from the Qur’anic milieu,\nsince similar treatments of Dan 9:24 are found in Greek texts. Thus, John Chrysostom’s\nAgainst the Jews (5:9) interprets the “sealing of vision and prophet” in Dan 9:24 as referring\nto the time when “prophecies shall cease,” by explic itly equating “to seal” (sphragisai)\nwith “to bring to a standstill” (stēsai) and by associating the verse with Matt 11:13, where\nJesus states that “all the prophets and the law prophesied until John [the Baptist] came”\n(Chrysostom 1979, 132; for the Greek, see Migne 1857–1866, 48:898).13 Theodoret of\n12 Two scholars who have recently expressed more confidence that al-B īrūnī et al. can be taken at face value\nare Fossum 1993, 151–152, and de Blois 2004, 46. Fossum asserts, perhaps a bit sweepingly, that “the Muslim authors\ncannot be understood as attributing titles of Muḥammad to Mani.” De Blois notes that the Cologne Mani Codex 72\n(Koenen and Römer 1988, 50) calls the disciples of previous apostles or messengers the “seal of their apostleship”\n(sphragis autou tēs apostolēs), and he infers that the Qur’an and Manichaeism both inherited the phrase “seal of the\nprophets” from Jewish Christ iani ty. Thus, while accepting that “seal of the prophets” is pre-I slamic Manichaean\nlanguage, de Blois does not imply that the Qur’an’s original recipients would have connected Q 33:40 to Mani.\nAgainst this hypothesis, I find it more convincing to consider Mani’s use of the phrase sphragis autou tēs apostolēs\na borrowing from 1 Cor 9:2, in line with Stroumsa 1986, 70–71. Moreover, to say that Muhammad or Mani was the\n“seal of the prophets” (as per Q 33:40 and al-B īrūnī) has a very dif ere nt meaning from describing the disciples\nof Paul or of some prophetic messenger, respectively, as the “seal” of their master’s “apostleship” (as per 1 Cor\nand the Cologne Mani Codex): disciples stand in a derivative relationship to their teachers, which is not how the\nQur’an understands the relationship of Muhammad to his prophetic forerunners.\n13 Note that the Greek text of Daniel cited by Chrysostom is not the Septuagint one but rather the version\nattributed to Theodotion, which has the more literal wording sphrangisai horasin kai prophētēn (Colpe 1984–1986,\n82, n. 45).\nkhatama 253", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Such affirmations must be placed against the background of ancient\nArab poets’ stress on the futility of human striving for per sis tence (kh-l -d ) and on the\ninevitability of settling, at most, for some attenuated surrogate of it. Before turning to\nQur’anic usage, it will therefore be helpful to examine relevant poetic data.\nThe root kh- l- d in pre- Islamic poetry. The notion of indefinite per sis tence into the\nfuture, expressed by derivatives of the root kh- l- d, is a prominent aspect of the conceptual\nfabric of pre- Qur’anic Arabic poetry (ERCQ 47–54; Müller 1981, 97–110). Preoccupied by\na keen sense of h uman ephemerality, ancient Arabic poetry highlights the unattainability\nof such permanence: t here is “nothing enduring and remaining in the face of life’s fateful\nvicissitudes” (lā arā ʿalā l-ḥ awādithi bāqiyan wa- lā khālidan) except for “the mountains\nfirmly implanted,” the sky, the land, “our Lord,” and the alternation of days and nights,\nsays a poem that is attributed (though not uncontroversially so) to Zuhayr (DSAAP, Zu-\nhayr, no. 20:10–11; see Sinai 2019b, 34–37). The natu ral backdrop against which human\nexistence plays out will endure forever, then, but not so humans themselves: “I know\nthat man is not immortal” (wa- aʿlamu anna l- marʾa ghayru mukhalladī), says Durayd ibn\nal- Ṣimmah (EAP 1:76), and a poem in which ʿAbīd ibn al- Abraṣ laments the demise of his\npeople declares: “I have remained after them (fa- khaladtu baʿdahum), yet I will not remain\nforever (wa- lastu bi- khālidin); the destructive course of time (al- dahr) is full of changes\nand hues” (Lyall 1913, ʿAbīd, no. 16:9; cited in ERCQ 47; cf. EAP 1:65). It would be illusory\nto think, like a fictional female interlocutor haranguing al- Mukhabbal, that it is wealth\nthat grants people infinite remaining (inna l- tharāʾa huwa l- khulūdu): not even a hundred\ncamels “ will make me remain forever” (tukhallidūnī), the poet retorts, and nothing will\ndeliver him from his doom (al- maniyyah; Lyall 1918–1924, no. 21:36–39; cited in Müller\n1981, 100, and ERCQ 48).1\nHaving resigned himself to the realisation that indefinite per sis tence into the future\nis not humanly attainable, the poetic hero turns to martial exploits and to ostentatious\nprodigality instead (DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 4:54–55; cited in ERCQ 50 and PP 148–149):\n“O youS who scold me because I attend the uproar of war and partake in pleasures, can\nyou make me remain forever (hal anta mukhlidī)? // So if you are unable to avert my\ndoom (maniyyatī), let me hasten towards it with what my hand possesses.” While the\npursuit of permanence is h ere abandoned as futile, other verses suggest that conformity\nto the heroic ethics of ancient Arabic poetry ofers at least the hope of a surrogate kind\nof immortality, consisting in the glory consequent upon heroic deeds. Thus, ʿUrwah ibn\nal- Ward announces his intention to exchange his life for “fame that endures, even if young\nmen do not remain forever” (aḥādītha tabqā wa-l -f atā ghayru khālidin; Nöldeke 1863,\nno. 3:2–3, and EAP 1:129).

Like poetry, the Qur’an pre sents the basic human condition as\nimprinted by mortality: no human has ever attained eternal existence (khuld) in the sense\nof straightforward immortality (Q 21:34; see Müller 1981, 106), not even divine messengers\n(Q 21:8). Rather, “every one will taste death” (Q 3:185, 21:35, 29:57; see u nder → dhāqa).2\nThe Qur’an moreover shares the poetic assumption that h umans will naturally strive to\novercome their innate state of evanescence: Q 26:129 alludes to the attempt to achieve\nimmortality through monumental buildings (Müller 1981, 105); similar to poetry, Q 104:3\ncriticises the misconception that it is wealth that causes one to remain forever (akhlada;\nsee PP 148–149); and Adam is successfully tempted by the devil to eat of the “tree of im-\nmortality” (shajarat al- khuld), presumably because he is deeply attracted by the promise\nof gaining khuld (Q 20:120; cf. 7:20).\nYet from the Qur’anic perspective, it is only the eschatological admission to God’s\nother- worldly paradise—to the “garden of immortality (jannat al-k huld) that was prom-\nised to the God-f earing” (Q 25:15; → jannah)— that w ill satisfy the innate h uman quest for\neternal life. The kind of khuld that is available to humans, then, does not consist in elud-\ning death in defi nitely but rather leads through death, resurrection, and God’s ensuing\neschatological judgement. In fact, once the resurrection and the judgement are factored\nin, the Qur’an pre sents indefinite future per sis tence as downright inescapable, in so far\nas the damned, too, face the prospect of eternal perdurance, though they will spend it\nundergoing infernal torment: God’s “enemies” will have as their “eternal abode” (dār\nal-k huld) the fire of hell, Q 41:28 says (see also under → jahannam). Accordingly, some\nverses expressly insist that the inmates of hell will not die (Q 14:17, 35:36; cf. 43:77 and\n69:27), even if they cannot properly count as being alive either (Q 20:74, 87:13: lā yamūtu\nfīhā wa-l ā yaḥyā), presumably due to the abundance of their sufering and misery. The\nQur’an’s binary or “polarized” (Stetkevych 1994, 101) vision of human permanence,\nconsisting either in eternal fulfilment and community with God or in eternal torment,\nis underscored by the frequent and often verse- final formula that humans will “forever\nremain” (khālidūn/- īn) in paradise or in hell (e.g., Q 2:25.39.81.82.162.217.257.275), a\nphrase that begins to appear already fairly early in the Meccan period (e.g., Q 20:76.101,\n23:11.103, 72:23).\nThe Qur’an’s explicit insistence on the perpetuity of damnation agrees with the appar-\nent sense of New Testamental statements about the “eternal fire” of hell and the like (see\nMatt 18:8 and 25:41.46, 2 Thess 1:9, Rev 20:10). At the same time, it stands in contrast to\n2 Cf. also Q 28:88: every thing perishes except for God’s countenance (kullu shayʾin hālikun illā wajhahū)\nand similarly 55:26–27. Q 7:20— where the devil tells Adam and Eve that eating from the prohibited tree w ill\nmake them “angels or immortal” (an takūnā malakayni aw takūnā mina l- khālidīn)— seems to imply that angels\nat least are not mortal. Taking this into account, the point of Q 28:88 and 55:26–27 may only be to assert the\ngeneral perishability of all things other than God rather than to predict their factual perishing.\n256 khalada", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 11:107–108 may be read as softening the perpetuity of dam-\nnation and paradise with the qualifier “ unless yourS Lord wills other wise” (illā mā shāʾa\nrabbuka; see also Q 6:128). This could be deemed to support the view of Ibn Taymiyyah\nand Ibn Qayyim al- Jawziyyah that damnation in hell will not in fact be eternal (Reynolds\n2020, 148–150, and Khorchide 2012, 56–57; see in more detail Hoover 2009, Hoover 2013,\nHoover 2019, 137–139, and Lange 2016a, 168–171).

According to Q 2:30 and 38:26, God made or appointed (jaʿala) Adam (or\nperhaps humankind in general) and David a khalīfah “on the earth” or “in the land” (fī\nl- arḍi; see also under → arḍ). Whether the singular noun khalīfah means “successor” or\n“vicegerent” is a long-s tanding crux of Qur’anic interpretation, whose importance is rein-\nforced by the Umayyad use of the title khalīfat allāh, “deputy of God” (Crone and Hinds\n1986; see also the critique in Rubin 2003b, 87–99). A purely inner- Qur’anic examination\nof the root kh- l- f, as undertaken most comprehensively by Rudi Paret and presented in the\nnext section, could suggest that the concept of a khalīfah does indeed turn on the idea of\nsuccession. The pre sent entry nonetheless goes on to argue that by widening the scope to\ninclude relevant data in Epigraphic South Arabian or Sabaic, “deputy” emerges as the more\nlikely sense in the Qur’an’s historical milieu, with the verb istakhlafa being denominal and\nmeaning “to appoint s.o. as a deputy.” At the same time, Qur’anic occurrences of istakh-\nlafa and the frequent phrase jaʿala + acc. khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa (“to make a group of p eople\nkhalīfahs”) may well, by virtue of the under lying Arabic root kh- l- f, preserve connotations\nof succession and the substitution of a par tic u lar sinful human collective by another, in\nthe expectation that the latter w ill more satisfactorily live up to God’s moral and religious\nexpectations. The entry continues by showing that the designation of Adam as a khalīfah,\ni.e., as God’s vicegerent or deputy, in Q 2:30 functions as a deliberate alternative to the\nBiblical statement that Adam was created in God’s “image and likeness” in Gen 1:26–27.\nThe Qur’anic phrase in Q 2:30 is surmised to have a dual task: first, to avoid what could\nhave been perceived to be an excessively anthropomorphic image of the deity; secondly,\nto side with one par tic u lar understanding of Gen 1:26–27, according to which humanity’s\ncreation in God’s likeness consists in their God- given dominion over the earth.\nKhalīfah as “successor”: Paret’s root- based approach. In at least two of its five\nQur’anic occurrences, in Q 7:169 and 19:59, the first- form verb khalafa means “to suc-\nceed”: the Biblical Israelites (Q 7:169) or the prophetic descendants of Adam and Abra-\nham (Q 19:59), the text says, “ were succeeded by others following them” (fa-k halafa\nmin baʿdihim khalfun), which successors are then accused of vari ous ofences.1 That\nkhalafa + acc. can have the sense of “to succeed s.o., to follow s.o., to come after s.o.,\nto remain behind after s.o.” is widely reported in premodern Arabic dictionaries (AEL\n792–793), and this lexicographical claim is consistent with vari ous other Qur’anic de-\n1 The other three instances of khalafa are Q 7:142.150 and 43:60, which will be discussed later in the entry.\nFor the participle al- khālifūn, see immediately below.\n258 istakhlafa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, the singular khalīfah, which\nis applied to Adam in Q 2:30 and to David in 38:26, might be considered to operate like an\nactive participle of khalafa and to mean “successor” (e.g., Paret 2001 and CDKA 90). The\nlocution jaʿala (+ acc.) khalīfatan fī l- arḍi, which appears in both Q 2:30 and 38:26, w ill then\nhave the sense “to appoint (s.o. as) a successor on the earth / in the land.”3 In its plural form,\nthe same phrase figures in a number of late Meccan verses (Q 6:165, 10:14.73, 35:39: jaʿal-\nakum/jaʿalnākum/jaʿalnāhum khalāʾifa ±​<l-a rḍi / fī l-a rḍi>; 7:69.74, 27:62: jaʿalakum/\nyajʿalukum khulafāʾa ±​<l- arḍi>), for all of which the translation “to make youp/them”—\ni.e., the Qur’anic believers or some past group like Noah and his fellow flood-s urvivors—\n“successors on the earth / in the land” is contextually apt.4 Fin ally, the tenth-f orm verb\nistakhlafa + acc. (Q 6:133, 7:129, 11:57, 24:55; see also 57:7) is reasonably considered to be\nsynonymous with jaʿala + acc. khalīfatan/khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa, which would give it, too, the\nsense “to make s.o. a successor, to appoint s.o. as a successor.”\nSuch a unitary and root-b ased construal of khalafa, istakhlafa, and khalīfah as revolving\naround the basic notion of succession, which has been careful developed by Rudi Paret\n(Paret 1970; see also Fischer 2001, 148–150), undoubtedly has great systematic appeal.\nIt is not difficult, moreover, to rationalise God’s statement to David in Q 38:26 that “we\nhave appointed youS as a successor in the land” by noting that David would certainly have\nbeen understood to follow in the footsteps of previous rulers, whether Israelite or not.5\nHowever, Paret’s unitary approach runs into manifest prob lems at Q 2:30, where God\ndeclares to the angels that “I am establishing a khalīfah on the earth” (innī jāʿilun fī l-a rḍi\nkhalīfatan). Whom is Adam supposed to be succeeding if indeed khalīfah means “suc-\ncessor” (al- Qāḍī 1988, 401; Schenzle 2017, 140–141)? The post- Qur’anic Islamic tradition\nposits that prior to the creation of Adam the earth was populated by jinn and subsequently\nalso by certain angels (al- Qāḍī 1988, 399–400, and SQ 21–22; e.g., Muqātil 2002, 1:96),\nbut there are no explicit Qur’anic statements supporting this notion nor is there any late\nantique pre ce dent for the idea of angels inhabiting the earth prior to Adam.6 Still, within\n2 The general impression is that the passive of khallafa connotes being left b ehind due to unreliability.

Rab.\n1:3, 3:8, 11:9; see also Kugel 1998, 48–51).

Though this is not an impossible\nsuggestion, its lack of confirmation in the Qur’an and pre- Qur’anic lit er a tures makes it\nseem unsatisfyingly ad hoc.\nA Sabaic reading of khalīfah and istakhlafa. There is, however, an alternative inter-\npretation of khalīfah and istakhlafa that sidesteps the dilemma just outlined. Importantly,\nit re spects Paret’s impor tant insights that jaʿala + acc. khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa is equivalent to\nistakhlafa + acc. and that in the absence of countervailing evidence the singular khalīfah\nought to be assumed to have the same meaning as its plural forms khalāʾif and khulafāʾ.\nAs Ruben Schenzle has pointed out (Schenzle 2017, 141–142), Abraha’s inscription by the\ndam of Mārib (CIH, no. 541) from March 548 CE employs the noun ḫlft, corresponding to\nArabic halīfah, as well as the plural ḫlyf, corresponding to khalāʾif, in a sense that has been\nglossed as “viceroy,” “governor,” or “commander,” and the verb s1tḫlf to mean “to appoint\ns.o. as viceroy/governor” (ll. 11–13, 36; see Beeston 1982, 60, and, for an En glish translation\nof the inscription, Robin 2015a, 164–167). The verb s1tḫlf recurs in the same sense in one\nof Abraha’s inscriptions at Murayghān, known under the siglum Ry 506 (l. 8; see Robin\n2015a, 169).7 If the meaning of Arabic khalīfah is equated with that of Sabaic ḫlft, then the\nQur’anic term does not first and foremost mean “successor” but rather designates some-\nbody whom a royal superior has set up as his representative or deputy. The Sabaic data\nthus confirm those voices in the Islamic exegetical tradition who maintain that a khalīfah\nis a vicegerent, deputy, or lieutenant acting in God’s stead (e.g., Ṭab. 1:480 and Jal. 16)\nrather than a successor.8\nAs it turns out, “deputy” or “vicegerent” in fact yields a good contextual fit for all\nQur’anic occurrences of khalīfah and its plurals khalāʾif and khulafāʾ, though it must be\nunderlined that Qur’anic references to h uman deputies of God do not imply an absence of\ntheir divine overlord. Qur’anic istakhlafa, too, is convincingly equated with Sabaic s1tḫlf and\nrendered as “to appoint s.o. as a khalīfah or deputy,” i.e., may be regarded as a denominal\nverb whose meaning derives from that of the noun khalīfah. This makes particularly good\nsense where istakhlafa collocates with the preposition fī, as in Q 57:7, which enjoins the\nQur’anic addressees to “spend from that over which he”— namely, God— “has appointed\nyou as deputies” (anfiqū mimmā jaʿalakum mustakhlafīna fīhi; see also Q 7:129 and 24:55).\nIn fact, even though the prepositional complement fī l-a rḍ is in many cases appropri-\nately translated as “on the earth/land” (e.g., istaʿmara + acc. fī l- arḍ, “to s ettle s.o. on the\nearth,” in Q 11:61; → makkana), when following istakhlafa or khalīfah it should prob ably\nbe treated not primarily, or at least not exclusively, as a localising expression but also as\nhistory of the world— namely, before the flood— angels descended to the earth is not unfamiliar in the Biblical\ntradition, based on the enigmatic notice about sexual u nions between the “sons of God” and the “ daughters of\nhumans” in Gen 6:1–4 (Kugel 1998, 179–183 and 194–199). However, this antediluvian angelic presence on earth\ndoes not predate the creation of Adam.\n7 See also the results for the root ḫ- l- f under sabaweb.uni-j ena.de. That Qur’anic khalīfah has a Sabaic back-\nground seems to have been first proposed in Grimme 1912, 160.\n8 The question whether ḫlft is originally Sabaic or inversely a loanword from Arabic may be left open in the\npre sent context (Schenzle 2017, 142). What ever the origin of the word, its use in royal Sabaic discourse would\npresumably have left an imprint on the subsequent use of Arabic khalīfah.\n260 istakhlafa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

By way of an aside, Q 7:142\nprovides a further illustration of the remit-i dentifying rather than localising employment of\nfī following a derivative of kh- l- f. The same denominal understanding may be extended to\nanother occurrence of khalafa, in Q 43:60 (wa- law nashāʾu la- jaʿalnā minkum malāʾikatan\nfī l- arḍi yakhlufūn): “If it were our will, we would bring forth from youp angels to function\nas deputies/vicegerents over the earth.”11\nIn sum, the Qur’anic lexemes khalīfah and istakhlafa as well as the phrase jaʿala + acc.\nkhalīfatan/khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa are manifestly po liti cal terms referring to the dele ga tion of\nrulership and power by a higher authority. With the exception of Q 7:142.150, the direct\nsource of such del e ga tion is God, the ultimate sovereign of the cosmos, and the Qur’anic\nemployment of the verb istakhlafa and the noun khalīfah may accordingly be considered\nto tie in with the royal traits with which the Qur’an generally invests the deity (Schenzle\n2017, 132–133; see under → malik). As will presently emerge, being deputised by God and\nretaining this position is conditional on piety and righ teousness.\nGod’s replacement of sinful deputies by o thers. We have seen that Sabaic epigraphic\ndata strongly support translating Qur’anic khalīfah as “deputy” or “vicegerent” rather than\n“successor.” However, we also saw that the notions of succession and following are an\nimpor tant part of the native Arabic semantics of the root kh- l- f. This creates the possibility\nthat the expressions istakhlafa + acc. and jaʿala + acc. khalīfatan/khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa, despite\ntheir primary meaning of appointing a deputy, harbour simultaneous overtones of succes-\nsion and sequentiality. If so, then the Sabaic-i nspired interpretation of khalīfah and istakhlafa\nshould not be regarded as incompatible with aspects of Paret’s inner- Qur’anic analy sis.\n9 In the two Sabaic occurrences of s1tḫlf mentioned above, this remit- identifying role is performed by the\npreposition ʿly.\n10 That fī l- arḍ does not primarily have a localising function is perhaps also suggested by the fact that two\ninstances of jaʿala + acc. khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa are not followed by fī l- arḍ (as in Q 10:14 and 35:39) but rather by\na genitive nomen rectum of khalāʾif/khulafāʾ: jaʿalakum khalāʾifa l-a rḍi (Q 6:165), yajʿalukum khulafāʾa l-a rḍi\n(Q 27:62), literally “he made/makes youp deputies of the earth.”\n11 Ambros prefers “to be a successor” h ere (CDKA 89). But the syntagm fī l- arḍ supports bracketing Q 43:60\ntogether with the vari ous Qur’anic instances of istakhlafa fī l-a rḍ and khalīfah/khalāʾif/khulafāʾ fī l-a rḍ, all of\nwhich hinge principally on deputyship. It is in any case likely that the specific wording of la-j aʿalnā minkum\nmalāʾikatan fī l- arḍi yakhlufūn in Q 43:60 is in part motivated by rhyme and approximately equates to la- jaʿalnā\nmalāʾikatan khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa l- arḍi min baʿdikum.

For instance, Q 10:13–14\nruns: “We destroyed generations before youp when they did wrong and their messengers\ncame to them with clear proofs and they would not believe. Thus do we recompense\npeople who sin. // Then we made youp deputies over the earth/land a fter them (thumma\njaʿalnākum khalāʾifa fī l- arḍi min baʿdihim), so that we might see how you would act.” The\nfact that being designated as God’s deputies tends to involve replacing unsatisfactory fore-\nrunners is also evident from passages employing the verbs adhhaba + acc., “to remove s.o.,”\nsuch as Q 6:133, asserting God’s ability to “remove youp and appoint whomever he w ills as\ndeputies a fter you, just as he produced you from the ofspring of another p eople” (in yashaʾ\nyudhhibkum wa-y astakhlif min baʿdikum mā yashāʾu ka- mā anshaʾakum min dhurriyyati qa-\nwmin ākharīn; for other relevant cases of adhhaba, see Q 4:133, 14:19, 35:16). Other verses\nthreaten the Qur’anic addressees that God might put in their stead (istabdala; CDKA 35)\nsome other people should they fail to live up to God’s expectations (Q 9:39 and 47:38; see\nal- Qāḍī 1988, 402, and Fischer 2001, 151). A linear historical sequence of such replacements\nis specified in the narrative middle section of Surah 7: ʿĀd were appointed deputies “ after”\n(min baʿdi) the people of Noah (v. 69), and Thamūd were appointed deputies after ʿĀd\n(v. 74; see al- Qāḍī 1988, 400, and Fischer 2001, 150–151). L ater in the same surah, Moses\naddresses the Israelites, who are sufering under Pha raoh, with the words, “Perhaps your\nLord w ill destroy your e nemy”—to wit, Phar aoh and his notables (→ malaʾ)— “and appoint\nyou as deputies over the land, so that he might see how you w ill act” (Q 7:129: qāla ʿasā\nrabbukum an yuhlika ʿaduwwakum wa-y astakhlifakum fī l- arḍi fa- yanẓura kayfa taʿmalūn).\nThe Israelites u nder Moses are thus described as succeeding Phar aoh and his supporters in\ntheir sway over the land of Egypt (Sinai 2017b).12 Overall, then, the Qur’anic employment\nof istakhlafa + acc. and jaʿala + acc. khalāʾifa/khulafāʾa is accompanied by a prominent\nstress on sequentiality and succession, and at least some of the Qur’anic recipients may\nwell have associated this aspect with the root kh- l- f itself.\nThe moral and religious misdeeds that might lead to a people being substituted for\nanother one and to be appointed deputies in their stead are often summarily designated\nas “wreaking corruption on earth” (→ ˻afsada fī l-a rḍ). A synoptic reading of the Qur’an\nbrings to light the understanding that history is governed by a responsive cycle consisting\nin God’s munificent “establishment” or “settlement” (→ makkana, askana, istaʿmara,\nbawwaʾa) of humans “on the earth” or “in the land,” which is potentially followed by\nhuman “wreaking of corruption” therein, which in turn results in God’s appointment\nof other humans as the culprits’ successors (see under → afsada). The scheme is predi-\ncated on the triple supposition, familiar from the Hebrew Bible and subsequent Jewish\nand Christian tradition, that God holds total sway over human history, that usufruct of\nGod’s earth or a part of it is conditional on satisfactory moral and religious per for mance,\nand that history, by virtue of being intelligible in terms of recurrent patterns of human\ntransgression and divine retribution, is invested with profound theological significance.\n12 The ministry of Moses is expressly dated a fter the destruction of the p eople of Noah, ʿĀd, the p eople\nof Lot, and Thamūd (Q 7:103: “Then after them we sent Moses to Pha raoh and his notables with our signs,”\nthumma baʿathnā min baʿdihim mūsā bi-ā yātinā ilā firʿawna wa- malaʾihi).

The remainder of the entry will focus on one par tic u lar\noccurrence of the term khalīfah, the characterisation of Adam as God’s deputy (khalīfah)\nin Q 2:30, and its relationship to older Jewish and Christian traditions. The narrative\ncontext of this occurrence of khalīfah is a divine announcement that would seem to\nprecede the creation of humankind: “I am establishing a deputy over the earth” (innī\njāʿilun fī l-a rḍi khalīfatan), God tells the angels, who then raise the objection that God’s\nnew creature will “wreak corruption (→ afsada) on earth” and “shed blood.” As has been\nobserved previously (e.g., Schreiner 2003, 34–37; Crone 2004, 40; Reynolds 2010a, 51;\nReynolds 2018, 35), this pre- creation announcement recalls Gen 1:26, according to which\nGod declared, in a similar narrative context prior to bringing forth Adam, “Let us make\nman in our image (ṣelem), according to our likeness (dәmût); and let them have domin-\nion (wәyirdû) over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle,\nand over all the wild animals of the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps\nupon the earth.”13 The following verse, Gen 1:27, doubles down on the idea of human\ntheomorphism by reiterating that “God created man in his image, in the image of God\nhe created him, male and female he created them.” A strand of rabbinic exegesis takes\nGod’s utterance in Gen 1:26 with its puzzling plural (“Let us make man”) to be addressed\nto the angels,14 and Genesis Rabbah reports how God gave the angels a demonstration of\nAdam’s superior wisdom by inviting him to name the animals previously created (Gen.\nRab. 17:4). Q 2:30–33 manifestly repro cesses this scene (BEQ 52–54; Reynolds 2010a, 47;\nHCI 148–150). There is, accordingly, a palpable link between Q 2:30 and the reception\nhistory of Gen 1:26. At the same time, the Qur’anic passage does not repeat the Biblical\nassertion that humans were made in God’s “image” and “likeness,” instead describing\nman as God’s “deputy.” Are we entitled to consider this Qur’anic omission of the imago\ndei phrase a deliberate eschewal?\nAn affirmative answer to this question is supported by the fact that a number of further\nQur’anic verses, too, do not adopt the Biblical concept of humankind’s creation in God’s\nimage or indeed voice implicit rebuttals of it. Thus, the early Meccan passage Q 95:4–5\ndeclares that God created or creates man “in the best constitution” or perhaps “in the\nbest posture” (fī aḥsani taqwīm), after which God “reduces him to the lowest of the low”\n(thumma radadnāhu asfala sāfilīn), a reference to h uman decrepitude in old age (see in\nmore detail under → taqwīm). At least prior to their inevitable decline, then, God has\nfashioned humans in an optimal form; yet this form or constitution is not characterised\nin theomorphic terms. Similarly, according to another early Meccan passage, Q 82:6–8,\nGod has fashioned humans in a harmonious and balanced manner (v. 7: alladhī khalaqaka\nfa- sawwāka fa- ʿadalak) and in “what ever shape he willed” (v. 8: fī ayyi ṣūratin mā shāʾa\n13 The idea of human theomorphism is reprised in Gen 5:1 and 9:6 (the latter justifying the prohibition of\nshedding human blood by the fact that man was created “in God’s image”).\n14 This view is explic itly rebufed by Jacob of Sarug, for whom the plural in Gen 1:26 reflects non- linguistic\ncommunication between God the Father and God the Son; see Mathews 2020, 52–55, ll. 2211–2244. Note that\nthe view that the plural was addressed to the angels is not the only position taken by rabbinic interpreters; see\nFossum 1985a, 208–220, and Schreiner 1993, 132–133.\nistakhlafa 263", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In fact, one version of the Samaritan Targum renders Gen 1:26\nby employing ṣura, the Aramaic cognate of Arabic ṣūrah (Salvesen 1991, 5); Jacob of Sarug\nsays of Adam that “his form” (ṣūrteh) declared God’s wisdom (Mathews 2014, 16–17, l. 9);\nand the Samaritan work known as Memar Marqah or Tibat Marqe, too, speaks of Adam’s\n“form” by using ṣurta (Fossum 1985a, 223–224, citing Macdonald 1963, 1:86 = Memar Mar-\nqah 4:2).17 Th ese comparative data make it quite compelling to read the Qur’anic assertion\nthat h umans w ere created “in what ever shape (ṣūrah)” God “willed” (Q 82:8)— rather than,\nas one might add, in God’s own shape— and its subsequent echoes in Q 3:6, 40:64, and\n64:3 as a pointed revision of the idea of theomorphic creation from Gen 1:26–27.\nThe preceding reading may be complemented by the observation that the Qur’anic\nuse of the noun ṣūrah (only found in Q 40:64, 64:3, and 82:8) and the verb ṣawwara\n(only found in Q 3:6, 7:11, 40:64, and 64:3; 59:24 has the active participle al- muṣawwir)\nis virtually confined to the context of God’s creation of humankind (Dmitriev 2010, 361).\n15 Schreiner argues that Q 82:8 is continuous with de- anthropomorphising tendencies in some of the tar-\ngumim and also in the Greek translation of Symmachus, which renders the Hebrew text corresponding to “God\ncreated man in his image” (Gen 1:27) as “God created man in a dif er ent image (en eikôni diaphorô), upright he\ncreated him” (Schreiner 2003, 30–31; see also Salvesen 1991, 2–3 and 6; my translation of diaphorô follows Sal-\nvesen rather than Schreiner, who opts for “excellent”). Symmachus does faithfully render the possessive suffixes\nin Gen 1:26 (“in our image, according to our likeness”; Salvesen 1991, 2–4). But as Schreiner explains, v. 26 was\nless problematic than the explicit reference to man’s creation “in the image of God” in v. 27, since the suffixes in\nv. 26 could be taken to refer to the angels whom God was understood to address h ere (see also Salvesen 1991, 5,\nand Schreiner 1993, 136).\n16 Arabic ṣūrah may be loaned from its Aramaic cognate ṣurta (Syriac: ṣūrtā), although ṣwr, “image,” is also\nattested in Sabaic. See Fraenkel 1886, 272–273; FVQ 201; http:// sabaweb . uni - jena . de / SabaWeb / Suche / Suche\n/S earchResultDetail ?i dxLemma​=​5230&showAll​=​0 (accessed 19 March 2021). Ambros, however, considers it\nmore probable that Arabic ṣūrah is “a cognate, not a loan” (CDKA 165).\n17 There are further occurrences of ṣurta in connection with Adam; e.g., Macdonald 1963, 1:88 and\n2:142 = Memar Marqah 4:2; Macdonald 1963, 1:46 and 2:73 = Memar Marqah 2:10. According to Ben- Ḥayyim, it\ncannot be excluded that books 3–6 of Memar Marqah / Tibat Marqe might date to the early Islamic centuries.\nBooks 1 and 2 he is prepared to date to the lifetime of Marqah, although he notes that book 2 contains “sev-\neral interpolated sections written in a language and style characteristic of the eleventh to thirteenth centuries”\n(Ben- Ḥayyim 1988, v; on the composition and date of the work in general, see also the relevant section of Hjelm\n2016).

The Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd, too, uses the\nverb ṣawwara in connection with God’s creation of Adam (al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 103:7:\nṣawwara l- rajulā), and Dmitriev credibly posits that this is to be understood in line with\nGen 1:26 as creation in God’s image (Dmitriev 2010, 360–362). At Q 59:24 (huwa llāhu\nl- khāliqu l- bāriʾu l- muṣawwiru), it is admittedly plausible to consider al- muṣawwir to be\nsynonymous with the preceding two participles, which refer to divine creatorhood in gen-\neral (al- khāliq, al- bāriʾ; see u nder → khalaqa). Yet a more specific reading of al- muṣawwir\nin the sense of “the shaper of humans” is not contextually impossible, and arguably pref-\nerable in light of the other Qur’anic instances of ṣūrah and ṣawwara. Hence, the divinely\nbestowed shape designated by ṣūrah and ṣawwara appears to be the shape of humans in\npar tic u lar, reinforcing the supposition that Q 82:8 and the other verses examined above\nemploy language that had come to be an established way of rendering the scene of Adam’s\ncreation from Gen 1:26–27 in Arabic.\nThe interim conclusion that arises from the preceding, in any case, is that passages like\nQ 2:30, 82:8, and 95:4 bespeak a Qur’anic reluctance to explic itly espouse the notion of\ncreation in the image of God. This notion may safely be presumed to have been known\namong Arabophone Jews and Christians, given that the idea is a prominent part of the\nrabbinic narrative repurposed in Q 2:30–33 and that ʿAdī ibn Zayd appears to be alluding\nto it as well. Thus, instead of asserting that h umans were fashioned in a “shape” (ṣūrah)\ncorresponding to that of God himself, vari ous Qur’anic passages conspicuously limit them-\nselves to underlining that the creator endowed h umans with an optimal constitution, in\nline with God’s sovereign w ill. Why might the Qur’anic texts display such a guarded stance\nvis- à-v is the idea of theomorphic creation? Gen 1:26 has been interpreted in a wide variety\nof ways, and from Philo on many Biblical interpreters have located the likeness obtaining\nbetween humans and God in certain rational or spiritual aspects of h uman personhood,\nsuch as endowment with reason (e.g., Colson and Whitaker 1929, 54–57 = Philo, On the\nCreation 69–71; see succinctly Clines 1968, 54–55; de Lacey 1979, 13–14; Schreiner 1993,\n137–138; Janowski et al. 2000). In the rabbinic tradition, however, the imago dei phrase is\nunderstood to involve not only m ental or spiritual features of h uman existence but also the\nlatter’s corporeal dimension; it has, moreover, been argued that for tannaitic interpreters\nthe creation of humans in God’s image entailed that God was in some way pre sent in his\nhuman image (Lorberbaum 2015; see also Schreiner 1993, 134–135). Indeed, a prominent\nstrand of modern Biblical research agrees that the original sense of the imago dei phrase\nfrom Gen 1:26 was to posit a corporeal resemblance between God and h umans (e.g., Gun-\nkel 1922, 112; see also Clines 1968, 55–59, and Miller 1972, 291–293).18 In light of this, it is\n18 In favour of his contention that the creation of Adam in God’s “image” and “likeness” implies corporeal\nresemblance, Gunkel compellingly points to Gen 5:3, according to which Adam begot a son “in his likeness, ac-\ncording to his image.” It is vital to add that despite my argument that the Qur’anic engagement with Gen 1:26–27\nand its interpretive tradition displays a concern to rule out a high degree of corporeal similarity between God\nand humans, the divine- human corporeal resemblance that ancient readers gleaned from Gen 1:26–27 could\nhave been quite vague, and thus not dissimilar to the Qur’an’s own “transcendent anthropomorphism” (see\nunder → allāh and further on in the main text). This caveat is supported by Ezek 1:26–28, a theophanic account\nthat overlaps with Gen 1:26 in the crucial term dәmût: “and seated above the likeness (dәmût) of a throne was a\nlikeness resembling the appearance of a h uman (dәmût kә- marʾēh ādām)” (Ezek 1:26). This passage from Ezekiel,\nit seems, accepts that there is a basic corporeal resemblance between God and humans, but at the same time\nsuggests that “the appearance of God’s glory defies adequate description” (Miller 1972, 291).\nistakhlafa 265", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

To be sure, the Qur’an is itself not free of an-\nthropomorphic tendencies: despite the declaration that “nothing is like” God (Q 42:11:\nlaysa ka- mithlihi shayʾun), the Qur’an depicts God as an embodied being and as having\ncertain humanoid traits, such as a face, eyes, and hands (see under → allāh). None-\ntheless, Qur’anic anthropomorphism remains cautious and fairly abstract throughout\nand is appropriately qualified as “transcendent anthropomorphism” (Williams 2009).\nNotably, the Qur’an gives no indication of considering God’s body to be a body made\nof flesh and instead appears to envisage God as a luminous being (see Q 7:143, 24:35,\n39:69). Moreover, the general point of Qur’anic anthropomorphisms would seem to be\nto stress God’s personhood rather than to convey any precise sense of his corporeal ap-\npearance (see again under → allāh). Hence, it would very much accord with the Qur’an’s\ngeneral theological profile to shun established Biblical language that could be taken to\nimply an undue degree of concrete similarity between God and his human creatures, or\nlanguage that might give succour to quasi- theophanic depictions of the newly created\nAdam along the lines of what one finds in the Cave of Trea sures, which stresses Adam’s\ndazzling splendour (Ri 1987, ch. 2).20\nAssuming that Q 2:30 deliberately replaces the notion that humans were created in\nGod’s image by the notion of human deputyship, how radical a break with the Biblical\ntradition does this constitute? In assessing the issue, it is helpful to bear in mind that apart\nfrom attempts to locate humankind’s affinity with God in certain corporeal or intellectual-\nspiritual attributes, humankind’s similarity to God could also be identified with dominion\nover the world. This understanding is set out, for example, in Ephrem’s Commentary on\nGenesis. Ephrem argues that humanity’s creation in God’s image and likeness, as formu-\nlated at the beginning of Gen 1:26, is in fact explicated by the rest of the verse, in which\nGod declares that h umans are to “have dominion” (Hebrew: wәyirdû, Peshitta: neshlṭūn)\nover the animals populating the earth (Ephrem 1955, 23 = Ephrem 1994, 94): “It is the\ndominion (shūlṭānā) that Adam received over the earth (ʿal arʿā) and over all that is in it\nthat constitutes the likeness of God, who has dominion over the heavenly t hings and the\n19 See also Chrysostom 1986, 109, attacking those who, based on the formulation “in our image” would\n“speak of the divine in h uman terms, which is the ultimate example of error, namely, to cast in h uman form him\nwho is without shape, without appearance, without change, and to attribute limbs and forms to the one who\nhas no body.”\n20 Q 2:34 and other Qur’anic passages share with the Cave of Trea sures the motif of angelic prostration to\nAdam; but in the Qur’an, the rationale is not Adam’s immanent glory but rather the fact that God o rders the angels\nto fall down before Adam (e.g., Q 2:34). The scene of the angels’ prostration is thus recast as a test in obedience\nto God (see HCI 145–147). On the date, provenance, and fluid textual transmission of the Cave of Trea sures, see\nnow Minov 2021, 18–48, which complicates use of this source by Qur’anic scholars.\n266 istakhlafa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This functionalist position was\nreasonably current among late antique Christians. Thus, Chrysostom similarly maintains\nthat the first half of Gen 1:26 is to be understood in light of the second half, although he\nidentifies h uman dominion specifically with creation in God’s “image” (Chrysostom 1986,\n110): “So ‘image’ refers to the matter of control (archē), not anything else, in other words,\nGod created the human being as having control of every thing on earth, and nothing on\nearth is greater than the human being, under whose authority (exousia) every thing falls.”\nThe view that creation in God’s image refers to human dominion was also espoused by\nother figures associated with the school of Antioch, including Diodore of Tarsus and\nTheodoret of Cyrus (McLeod 1981, 459–460, n. 13). Moreover, as Ana Davitashvili has\npointed out to me, Narsai explic itly declares that God set Adam up as a “stewart,” “vice-\ngerent,” or “deputy” (apeṭropā, from Greek epitropos) over his creation (McLeod 1981,\n459, translating from Mingana 1905, 1:17; see in par tic u lar l. 13). This statement forms\nan especially riveting counterpart to the Qur’anic term khalīfah. Jacob of Sarug, too,\nrepeatedly underscores Adam’s dominion and rulership over the world (Mathews 2020,\n70–73, ll. 2376–2378, 2385, 2395–2400).23\nThe Qur’anic description of Adam as God’s khalīfah unmistakably stands in the tradition\nof this Biblical and Biblically based emphasis on human dominion (thus already Cragg\n1968, 27). More specifically, when Q 2:30 substitutes the Biblical imago dei phrase by the\nterm khalīfah, this achieves several t hings. First, Q 2:30 overwrites the Biblical imago dei\nphrase and thereby avoids any suggestion that t here might be concrete and far- reaching\ncorporeal similarity between God and humans, or that Adam is to be considered a sort of\nreplica of his divine creator. Secondly, Q 2:30 does so by drawing on established Qur’anic\n21 Reynolds discerns a similar view in the Cave of Trea sures (Reynolds 2010a, 51), although it is less explicit\nthere than in Ephrem’s commentary. See in par tic u lar Ri 1987, Eastern manuscript group, ch. 2:19, according to\nwhich God “gave dominion” (ashleṭ) to Adam.\n22 In the post- Qur’anic period, this view was also embraced by Saadia Gaon (Schreiner 2003, 33–34). For\nsome words of caution regarding the merits of this position, see Miller 1972, 294–297, who notes that “the motif\nconcerning man’s dominion over the animals could be transmitted and expounded without any reference at all\nto his creation in the ‘image of God’ ” (see Ps 8:5–9), while Gen 9:6 (where the prohibition of shedding human\nblood is justified by humankind’s creation in God’s “image”) demonstrates that “the motif of man’s similarity to\nGod could be transmitted without any reference to his dominion over the other creatures” (Miller 1972, 296–297).\nThis suggests that Gen 1:26 is putting forward two separate (though perhaps linked) notions.\n23 These references to Jacob are likewise due to Ana Davitashvili.\nistakhlafa 267", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thirdly, the manner in which the Qur’an replaces the Biblical imago dei phrase\nin fact enshrines one par tic u lar understanding of it, namely, the functionalist interpreta-\ntion that human likeness to God consists in human dominion over the world. Fourthly, by\nhaving recourse to the term khalīfah, Q 2:30 efectively highlights the derivative nature of\nhuman dominion: a khalīfah does not only wield authority, but is himself subordinate to a\nsuperior authority. By contrast, when Ephrem invokes the concept of h uman “dominion”\n(shūlṭānā), the crucial aspect that this dominion is derivative or vicarious requires being\nadditionally stated. The Qur’anic concept of a khalīfah thus foregrounds God’s ultimate\nsupremacy over humans and the fact that their exalted position is rooted in an act of del-\ne ga tion that may be revoked at any moment.\nIt is instructive in this regard to juxtapose Q 2:30 with the manner in which the idea\nof human dominion over the world is formulated by the Christian Arabic poet ʿAdī ibn\nZayd, according to whom God made humans “lords over creation” (al- Muʿaybid 1965,\nno. 103:18: li- yajʿalanā fawqa l- bariyyati arbāban).24 Unlike ʿAdī, the Qur’an does not pre-\nsent humans as “lords” in their own right— the title → rabb being mostly reserved for God\nin the Qur’an25— but casts them merely as deputies of the true Lord, God. Much closer to\nthe Qur’anic understanding of what it means for Adam, and through him humankind at\nlarge, to be God’s khalīfah is a statement by Philo. He remarks, on the general subject of\nman’s dominion (hēgemonia), that God made man “as a sort of driver and pi lot, to drive\nand steer the things on earth, and charged him with the care of animals and plants, like a\ngovernor subordinate (hyparchos) to the chief and g reat King” (Colson and Whitaker 1929,\n70–73 = Philo, On the Creation 88, cited in Papoutsakis 2017, 77).26 Eusebius subsequently\ntransfers the title of hyparchos to Constantine (Crone 2004, 194; Papoutsakis 2017, 77), a\nlink recalling the fact that the Qur’an casts not only Adam as a khalīfah but also a prominent\nsubsequent ruler, David. But of course, as noted earlier, Philo does not explic itly identify\nman’s creation in God’s “image” and “likeness” with this h uman station of governorship,\npreferring instead to equate man’s likeness to God with the h uman mind or nous (Colson\nand Whitaker 1929, 54–57 = Philo, On the Creation 69–71).\nThere is one more terminological link to consider. The Qur’anic application of the term\nkhalīfah to Adam may be compared with a passage from Jacob of Sarug’s verse homily on\nTamar (con ven iently edited and translated in Brock 2002). When Adam was created, Jacob\nsays, he was given the “likeness” of Christ, so that by virtue of it he might “reign” (namlek)\nover God’s creatures; and by breathing into him, as recounted in Gen 2:7, God “anointed”\nAdam so that the latter might function as a “vicar” or a “place- keeper” (nāṭar dukktā) in the\nworld u ntil the coming of the true anointed one, Christ (ll. 41–46; see Papoutsakis 2017, 7\nand throughout).27 As Papoutsakis explains in a monograph-l ength study of the passage,\nJacob h ere “glosses ‘image’ with ‘vicarius’ ” (Papoutsakis 2017, 140), by making use of a Syriac\n24 But note that Toral- Niehof 2008, 249, considers it pos si ble that this verse is a later Islamic addition.\n25 At Q 12:41.42.50 (perhaps also at 12:23), rabb is exceptionally used for a human “master.”\n26 For a detailed analy sis of the term hyparchos, as used by Philo and Eusebius, see Papoutsakis 2017, 75–77.\nFor a further occurrence in Philo, awareness of which I owe to Marianna Klar, see Colson and Whitaker 1929,\n116–117 = On the Creation 148 (where the word is rendered “viceroy”).\n27 Brock’s translation difers from Papoutsakis’s by rendering mshīḥā ʿabdeh as “Christ made him” rather\nthan “he [God] made him anointed” = “he anointed him.”\n268 istakhlafa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Papoutsakis moreover identifies a place in Ephrem’s com-\nmentary on Genesis (specifically, on Gen 49:10) where the label “vicars” (nāṭray dukktā) is\napplied to David and his descendants, on the logic that they reigned in lieu of the coming Son\nof God (Papoutsakis 2017, 55–69; see also Ephrem 1955, 113–114 = Ephrem 1994, 203–204).\nPapoutsakis himself is aware of the potential contribution that the material studied by him\nmight make to elucidating the Qur’anic employment of khalīfah (Papoutsakis 2017, 194).\nTaking up his clue, one is bound to be struck by the parallelism between the Qur’an’s theo-\nlogical uptake of what seems to have been a technical military term (Abraha’s ḫlft), on the\none hand, and Ephrem and Jacob’s theological uptake of a technical administrative term\n(Greek: topotērētēs, Syriac: nāṭar dukktā), on the other. W hether the parallelism indicates\nreal historical contact remains unclear for the time being, given that the use of po litic al\nlanguage in a theological context is a general phenomenon.28 Irrespective of the issue of\ndependence, however, it is clear that the Qur’an’s rationale in calling Adam and David a\nkhalīfah “over the earth” or “over the land” (fī l- arḍ; Q 2:30, 38:26) is at least partly similar\nto that which informs Ephrem and Jacob’s use of the concept of a “vicar” or “place-k eeper”\n(nāṭar dukktā): Adam and David w ere not kings in their own right, seeing that it is only\nGod who is the “true king” (Q 20:114, 23:116: al- malik al-ḥ aqq; see u nder → malik). Though\nAdam and David are equipped with the plenitude of kingly authority over the earth (or\nperhaps, in the case of David, over the Israelite realm), the authority conferred upon them is\nirreducibly vicarious. H uman rulership is thus subjected to a terminological “downgrading\nor diminution” (Papoutsakis 2017, 192; cf. ibid., 74).\nA diference remains, however. When Ephrem and Jacob speak of human “vicars” or\n“place- keepers,” this points forwards in time to the eschatological coming of Christ the\nKing. The Qur’an, too, posits that God’s kingship w ill most fully manifest itself on the day\nof judgement (e.g., Q 40:16; see under → malik); but this eschatological expectation is not\nexplicit when Adam and David are called a khalīfah in Q 2:30 and 38:26. Instead, at least\nin the latter case the focus is unequivocally on David’s responsibility to discharge the au-\nthority conferred upon him in a morally satisfactory fashion (Q 38:26): “O David, We have\nmade you a deputy over the land; so judge between the p eople in truth according to what\nis right (fa-ḥ kum bayna l-n āsi bi- l-ḥ aqqi) and do not follow desire, for it w ill lead you astray\nfrom God’s path. Those who go astray from God’s path w ill have a violent punishment for\nhaving forgotten the day of reckoning.” What occupies the centre stage h ere is the moral\naccountability that follows from being God’s khalīfah, not a khalīfah’s eventual relief by\nthe divine king; and the eschatological aspect that is undeniably pre sent in Q 38:26 pivots\non the danger of damnation, not on the expectation of immediate divine rulership. This\nis entirely in tune with the general Qur’anic use of the root kh- l- f and the theme of God’s\nreplacement of sinful deputies that was analysed above. The Qur’anic concept of a khalī-\nfah thus lacks the temporal dimension that Papoutsakis convincingly discerns in Ephrem\nand Jacob’s use of nāṭar dukktā (Papoutsakis 2017, 76–77).

God is “the creator of all things”\n(khāliqu kulli shayˈin; Q 6:102, 13:16, 39:62, 40:62; cf. ho pantōn ktistēs in 2 Macc 1:24 and\nsimilarly Sir 24:8), and the power to bring something into existence is an exclusive pre-\nrogative of his (e.g., Q 35:3: “Is there a creator other than God?”). By contrast, the partner\ndeities venerated by the Qur’an’s pagan adversaries (→ ashraka) are denied any creative\nefficacy (e.g., Q 7:191: “Do they venerate as partner deities something that does not create\nanything but is itself created?”). Since the Qur’an‘s general conception of God is treated\nelsewhere (→ allāh), the pre sent entry focusses on the diction employed in affirmations\nof divine creation. The entry begins with an overview of the Qur’an’s three main verbs of\ncreation khalaqa, baraʾa, and faṭara. This is followed by discussions of the Qur’an’s lack\nof any unequivocal statement to the efect that God’s creation of the cosmos proceeded ex\nnihilo or from nothing, of the Qur’anic tendency to understand divine creation as an on-\ngoing and pre sent real ity, and of the link between creation and resurrection. The Qur’an’s\neschewal of the Biblical notion that humans were created in God’s “image” and “likeness”\n(Gen 1:26) is treated under → istakhlafa.\nKhalaqa. Usage of the verb khalaqa to denote divine creation, especially of humans, is\nalready attested in some credibly pre-I slamic verses of Arabic poetry (Sinai 2019b, 27–28).\nMoreover, judging by the Qur’an’s portrayal of the pagan “associators,” they too accepted\nthe notion of a divine creator (QP 54–55; → ashraka, → allāh). Unsurprisingly, therefore,\nthe general outlines of the Qur’anic doctrine of divine creation are in place already in the\nearly Meccan surahs, which contain frequent reminders that God has “created” (khalaqa)\nhumans (Q 15:28.33, 26:78.166.184, 37:11.96, 51:56, 53:45.46, 55:3.14, 56:57.59, 70:19.39,\n74:11, 79:27, 90:4, 75:38, 77:20, 78:8, 80:18–19, 82:7, 86:5–6, 90:4, 92:3, 95:4, 96:1–2).\nLess often, early Meccan surahs highlight God’s creation of other beings, such as camels\n(Q 88:17) and the jinn (Q 55:15), and assert that he “built” or “created” the heavens (Q 67:3,\n78:12, 79:27; see also 91:5). Q 15:85 and 44:38 first articulate the tripartite claim that God\n“created the heavens and the earth and what is in between them” (cf. also Q 52:36), a\nformula that is reminiscent of Gen 1:1 (“In the beginning, God created the heavens and\n270 khalaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:293", "title": "Page 293", "locator": "pdf_page:293", "text": "the earth”) and goes on to recur as a whole (e.g., Q 21:16, 25:59, 30:8, 32:4, 50:38) or in\npart (e.g., Q 2:164, 3:190.191, 6:1.73, 7:54, 9:36) in numerous later Qur’anic verses (see\nunder → arḍ). In line with the Biblical account of creation in Gen 1, several verses main-\ntain that God’s creation of the cosmos occurred in six days (e.g., 50:38; see also below and\nunder → arḍ).\nThe Qur’an pre sents God’s creation as a perfectly crafted system that is f ree from faults\nand defects (Q 67:3–4 and also 50:6; see Zirker 1993, 95, 215, and → afsada; cf. Neuwirth\n2010, 439). A similar faith in the perfection of the cosmos, understood in the sense of\nconsummate proportionality, lies behind the early Meccan verse Q 54:49: God “created\nevery thing according to a specific mea sure” (innā kulla shayʾin khalaqnāhu bi-q adar),1\nan affirmation that resonates in Q 25:2 (wa- khalaqa kulla shayʾin fa-q addarahu taqdīrā,\n“He created every thing and endowed it with mea sure”; cf. 6:101).2 Another early Meccan\ngeneralisation about divine creation is found in Q 51:49, which declares that God “created\nevery thing in pairs” (wa-m in kulli shayʾin khalaqnā zawjayni; see Ambros 1990, 294), tying\nin with other verses stressing that humans were created “male and female” (Q 53:45,\n75:39, and 92:3; cf. Gen 1:27) and that fruit-b earing plants too were made in pairs (Q 13:3,\n55:52). As will be further illustrated below, the Qur’an consistently highlights the perfect\nsymmetry and proportion of God’s creation, obviating any need to hope that creation\nwill, as Paul puts it, “be set f ree from its bondage to decay” a fter having been “groaning\nin labour pains” (Rom 8:21–22; cf. Zirker 1993, 95). Despite its perfection, of course, the\ncosmic edifice that God has crafted w ill ultimately be dismantled when the eschatological\n“hour” comes (HCI 173), in order to be replaced by a new and eternal habitat, paradise and\nhell, which will accommodate the eschatological disaggregation of the morally mixed lot\nof con temporary humanity into the righ teous and the sinners.\nOther verbs for divine creation, especially faṭara and baraʾa. Apart from khalaqa,\nthe Qur’an deploys a considerable range of further expressions for acts of divine creation.\nThey comprise not only action verbs whose meaning, at least in the human domain, is\nrelatively concrete, such as banā (“to build”), mahada and daḥā (“to spread out,” namely,\nthe earth; see Q 51:48, 79:30, and under → arḍ), or akhraja (“to bring out, to bring forth”;\ne.g., Q 2:22.61, 3:27, 6:95.99, 7:57); Qur’anic verbs of creation also include a number of\nmore general terms that are marked by considerable semantic overlap with khalaqa, such\nas jaʿala, “to make” (e.g., Q 2:22, 77:25.27, 78:6.9.10.11.13; see Peterson 2001, 477–478) and\nanshaʾa, “to produce, to bring forth,” an exclusively Meccan expression (e.g., 6:6.98.133.141,\n11:61, 13:12; see Peterson 2001, 478–479).\nEspecially close to khalaqa, and difficult to render in any other way than as “to create,”\nare the verbs faṭara and baraʾa. Like anshaʾa, faṭara is conspicuously l imited to the Meccan\nperiod. It occurs ster eo typically as the active participle fāṭir in the phrase fāṭir al-samāwāt\nwa- l- arḍ, “the creator of the heavens and the earth” (Q 6:14, 12:101, 14:10, 35:1, 39:46, 42:11).\n1 Cf. also 65:3 (qad jaʿala llāhu li- kulli shayʾin qadrā, “God appointed a mea sure for every thing”). As noted\nin CDKA 220, qadar and qadr— which in the Qur’an can mean not only “mea sure” but also God’s “ordainment”\nor “decree” (Q 33:38; see also the discussion of laylat al- qadr in Q 97:1.3 under → amr)— are prob ably “to be\nconsidered merely as variants of one lexeme.” On how these two meanings might be linked, see el Masri 2020,\n69–70; on qadar in the pre- Islamic sense of “ordainment, decree,” see Caskel 1926, 20–21.\n2 On qaddara, see CDKA 220 and also below, at the end of the section entitled “Creation as divine bestowal\nof form and shape. . . .” Elsewhere, such as Q 15:60 and 27:57, qaddara must mean “to ordain, to decree,” al-\nthough this may be thought of as the ordainment of the right time, rather than mea sure or amount, for something\n(CDKA 220).\nkhalaqa 271", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:294", "title": "Page 294", "locator": "pdf_page:294", "text": "Fāṭir corresponds to Ethiopic faṭārī, “creator” (NB 49; FVQ 221), an active participle like\nits Arabic counterpart. Derived from this usage, conjugated forms of the verb faṭara can\nbe employed in the denominal sense of “to create,” as in Q 6:79 (God faṭara l- samāwāti\nwa- l- arḍa, “created the heavens and the earth”) or 36:22 (where God is described as alladhī\nfaṭaranī, “he who created me”), while the noun fiṭrah (“creaturely constitution”) denotes\nthe natur al religious disposition with which the divine creator has endowed humankind\n(Q 30:30; see u nder → ḥanīf). The fact that other verses have khalaqa instead of faṭara in\nsimilar contexts (e.g., Q 6:1.73, 7:54, 9:36, 10:3, 11:7, according to which God “khalaqa the\nheavens and the earth”) confirms the two verbs’ far- reaching semantic equivalence.\nNonetheless, the synonymity of faṭara and khalaqa may not be complete. After all, the\nnative Arabic meaning of the consonantal root f-ṭ - r has to do with cleaving or being cleft,\nas indicated by the use of vari ous derivatives of it (namely, tafaṭṭara and infaṭara, “to be\nsplit,” and fuṭūr, “cracks”) in Q 19:90, 42:5, 67:3, 73:18, and 82:1. In view of t hese verses,\none may surmise that the original recipients of the Qur’an may have understood faṭara = “to\ncreate” to have semantic overtones of cleaving and sundering. This conjecture is far from\nnovel, in so far as Muslim exegetes sometimes gloss the verb faṭara as shaqqa, “to split”\n(Burge 2008, 56–58; see, e.g., Ṭab. 9:175–176, on Q 6:14). The hypothesis that Qur’anic\nfaṭara has a connotation of cleaving receives significant support from the assertion in\nQ 21:30 that “the heavens and the earth w ere fused together” before God “tore them apart”\n(fa- fataqnāhumā). This impor tant verse will be discussed in more detail below.\nWhereas faṭara is l imited to Meccan surahs, occurrences of baraʾa, “to create” (Q 57:22),\nof the corresponding participle bāriʾ, “creator” (Q 2:54, 59:24), and of the definite noun\nal- bariyyah, “the creatures” (Q 98:6.7), are all Medinan. Given that other Arabic deriva-\ntives of the root b- r-ʾ do not signify creation, the terms just enumerated are evidently used\nunder the semantic impact of Hebrew bārāʾ or Aramaic brā (FVQ 75–76; see also Mingana\n1927, 88), which figure prominently in the creation accounts of Genesis, whether in the\nHebrew Bible, the targums, or the Peshitta (Gen 1:1.21.27, 2:3, 5:1, 6:7). Thus, al- bāriʾ would\nseem to be an Arabisation of Syriac or Jewish Aramaic bāryā, “the creator” (cf. Hebrew\nborēʾ, from which CQ 20 would derive bāriʾ), while bariyyah may be linked with Syriac\nbrītā, “creation,” “world,” and “creature,” and also Hebrew bәriʾah/bәriyyah, “creation,”\nand Hebrew/Aramaic biryah/biryta, “creature” (see TS 600–601; SL 189; DTTM 193, 194;\nDJPA 112–113; DJBA 245). Although Jefery argues for a Syriac provenance of Qur’anic\nbaraʾa, bāriʾ, and bariyyah, the Medinan date of all their Qur’anic occurrences suggests\nrather that they reflect rabbinic diction as mediated by Medina’s Jewish residents, among\nwhom the Arabic terms in question may well have been in use. This fits well with the fact\nthat Q 2:54 employs the term bāriʾ in the context of an address that is uttered by Moses\nafter having discovered the Israelites’ worship of the Golden Calf. It is noteworthy that the\nHebrew verb bārāʾ was also loaned into Sabaic, as demonstrated by a Jewish inscription\nfound close to the Ḥimyarite capital Ẓafār (Beeston et al. 1982, 30; Robin 2000, 49–50;\nGajda 2009, 233 and 235).\nCreation as divine bestowal of form and shape rather than as creation ex nihilo.\nAlready the relatively common combination of khalaqa with the preposition min, “from,”\nthroughout the Qur’an (e.g., Q 3:49.59, 4:1, 5:110, 6:2, 55:14.15, 70:39) signals that the\nQur’an does not generally assume that divine creation proceeds ex nihilo. A similar ob-\nservation emerges from Q 75:38, where the verb khalaqa clearly designates a subsequent\nstage in the formation of a h uman fetus rather than its initial genesis: “then he [the h uman\n272 khalaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Given the importance of the issue, it is appropriate to\nundertake a more detailed review of some of the Qur’anic prooftexts that may be adduced\nfor or against creation ex nihilo.\nOne of the Qur’anic expressions that has been linked to the notion of creation from\nnothing is the epithet badīʿ al-samāwāt wa- l- arḍ, “the originator of the heavens and the\nearth,” which is twice (Q 2:117, 6:101) used instead of the more common phrase fāṭir al-\nsamāwāt wa- l- arḍ, “the creator of the heavens and the earth” (Q 6:14, 12:101, 14:10, 35:1,\n39:46, 42:11). However, it is difficult to marshal any positive evidence that the word badīʿ\nnecessarily connotes creation from nothing (van Ess 2017–2020, 4:504). A more prom-\nising argument for creation ex nihilo, at least on the face of it, is provided by another\nphrase in Q 2:117: when God “decides on [creating] something (idhā qaḍā amran), he\nmerely says to it, ‘Be,’ and it is (yaqūlu lahu kun fa- yakūn).” The phrase has close parallels\nin Q 3:47, 19:35, and 40:68, and the latter part of the formula—k un fa- yakūn, “ ‘Be,’ and it\nis”— recurs in a number of further verses (Q 3:59, 6:73, 16:40, 36:82). The idea that God\ncreates by, as it were, commanding entities into being is bound to recall the series of\nexistence- inducing utterances that God utters in Gen 1:3.6.9 etc., such as the order “Let\nthere be [≈ kun] light,” followed by the statement that t here “was [≈ fa- yakūn] light” (cf.\nalso m. Abot 5:1). The Qur’anic kun fa- yakūn topos also recalls a statement by Aphrahat,\nwho is concerned to show that God was not wearied by creating the world (cf. Q 2:255\nand 50:38) and who claims that when God “made (ʿbad) all of his creatures by the word\nof his mouth (b- mellat pūmeh), he spoke and they came into existence (emar wa- hway)”\n(Demonstrations 13:11 = Parisot 1894, 565–566; translation from Lehto 2010, 300). However,\neven this resemblance falls short of establishing that the Qur’an is presupposing creation\nex nihilo: it is quite feasible to read Gen 1 as having creation proceed from a watery chaos\n(see below), and the claim that the Qur’an is not espousing such a position would require\nan additional argument.\nIn fact, while the Qur’anic kun fa- yakūn passages did facilitate the Islamic reception\nof the idea of creation from nothing (van Ess 2017–2020, 4:502–503),5 they too on closer\n3 See also the remarks on divine creatorhood and the Qur’an’s occasionalistic portrayal of natur al pro cesses\nunder → allāh.

To be sure, in Q 16:40 the divine voice\ndeclares, “When we want to bring something into existence, we only say to it (innamā qaw-\nlunā li- shayʾin idhā aradnāhu an naqūla lahu), ‘Be,’ and it is” (similarly Q 36:82). This must\nrefer to God’s bringing into being something previously non- existent; but even so it remains\nunclear w hether in d oing so God operates on a prior substrate or not. Indeed, in Q 40:68\nthe context militates against reading the kun fa- yakūn formula to entail creation ex nihilo,\nconsidering that the preceding verse, 40:67, details how God creates h umans “from earth\n[namely, the first h uman Adam], then from a drop [of sperm], then from a clot [of blood]”\netc. Accordingly, at least in Q 40:68 the creative power of God’s word is likely to pertain to\nthe transformation (albeit the instantaneous, immediate, and wondrous transformation) of\nsomething into something e lse and not to God’s bringing something into being without any\nprior substrate of change. The same impression arises from Q 3:59, where Jesus and Adam\nare described as having been created by divine fiat: God “created him [namely, Adam] from\nearth, and then said to him, ‘Be,’ and he was”: once again, creation by fiat would seem to\noperate on and transform a pre- existing substratum, earth.6\nIn addition to the absence of any unequivocal Qur’anic statement in favour of creation\nex nihilo, t here are in fact two l ater Meccan passages, Q 21:30 and 11:7, that come close to\naffirming the opposite, i.e., creation from some kind of primal m atter or substrate. Accord-\ning to Q 21:30, “the heavens and the earth w ere fused together (kānatā ratqan)7 and we tore\nthem apart (fa- fataqnāhumā); and we made e very living t hing from w ater (wa- jaʿalnā mina\nl- māʾi kulla shayʾin ḥayyin).” H ere, creation manifestly proceeds via a divine act of sundering\n(verb: fataqa) some amorphous and primordial substrate, resulting in the formation of the\nheavens and the earth.8 The immediately following reference to creation from w ater allows\nfor two interpretations. On what is perhaps the most literal reading, “we made every living\nthing from w ater” is strictly delimitative and conveys that it is only plants and animals—i .e.,\nbeings who manifestly require w ater to survive—t hat are created from w ater. This under-\nstanding is not implausible, given that two other verses reiterate the same point specifically\nfor terrestrial animals and h umans (Q 24:45: God “created e very land animal from w ater,”\nwa- llāhu khalaqa kulla dābbatin min māʾin; 25:54: God “created h umans from w ater,” wa-\nhuwa lladhī khalaqa mina l- māʾi basharan).9 If the delimitative reading is correct, then\n6 On Q 3:59, see also n. 16 under → rūḥ. Another verse that might be read as implying creation ex nihilo yet\nprobably shouldn’t be is Q 52:35; see O’Shaughnessy 1985, 4–5 and 55.\n7 According to Muslim lexicographers, rataqa means the mending or closing of a breach (ilḥām al-f atq\nwa-i ṣlāḥuhu; al- Azharī [1964–1976], 9:53; cf. AEL 1027). Al- Ṭabarī glosses kānatā ratqan as meaning “ there\nwas no interstice between them; rather, they clung together” (laysa fīhimā thaqbun bal kānatā multaṣiqatayn;\nṬab. 16:254). It would seem that the verbal noun ratq (or the variant rataq; MQ 6:16 and MQQ 4:134) is used in\nthe sense of the passive participle martūq or rather its feminine dual martūqatayn (Zam. 4:140; cf. AEL 1027).\n8 The verb fataqa may be compared with a line in the creation poem attributed to Adī ibn Zayd (al- Muʿaybid\n1965, no. 103:3; see Dmitriev 2010, 356–357), according to which the primal mixture of w ater, wind, and darkness\nwas devoid of any rent (fatq) or gap (khalal).\n9 It is not immediately clear how Q 25:54 is to be reconciled with other passages describing the creation\nof humans from clay (e.g., Q 6:2, 7:12). One might solve the prob lem by proposing a distinction between the\nultimate origination of humans and land animals from water (as per Q 24:45 and 25:54) and their proximate\norigination from some other substance (as per Q 6:2 etc.). This would fit with the understanding, developed in\nwhat follows in the main text, that Q 21:30 and 11:7 pre sent water as the ultimate substrate of every thing, not\njust of living beings. Alternatively, one might point to Q 32:8, 77:20, and 86:6, where the creation of humans\n“from lowly water” or “from gushing water” (min māʾin mahīn, min māʾin dāfiq) plainly means “from sperm.”\n(Q 32:7–8 combines the creation of the first human from clay with the subsequent creation of his descen-\ndants from sperm- water.)

If this is correct, then the scenario evoked would seem to\nbe one in which the pro cess of creation commences with the creator being in the presence\nof a primordial watery hyle, from which he subsequently brought forth the heavens and the\nearth.10 As Geiger notes (WMJA 64), Q 11:7 recalls the first creation account in the book of\nGenesis, which can be summarised as saying that a “pre- existent watery waste (1:1–2) was\ndivided into two by the creation of a solid dome or vault (the sky, 1:6–8), so that there was\nwater both above and below it” (Barton and Muddiman 2001, 42).11 Indeed, at least some\nancient interpretations of Gen 1:2 took the statement that “the earth was a formless void\n(tōhû wābōhû)” to allude to primordial w aters (Kister 2007, 237–238).12 Similarly, according\nto 2 Pet 3:5–6 (referenced in BEQ 5), “by the word of God heavens existed long ago and\nan earth was formed out of water and by means of water (ex hydatos kai di’ hydatos), //\nthrough which the world of that time was deluged with water and perished” (referring to\nthe flood of Noah). H ere, at least the earth (though apparently not heaven) is held to have\nbeen formed from water. In view of all this, it is attractive to combine Q 11:7 and 21:30 and\nwater as a primordial substrate at all but rather about generation from sperm (KK 361, on Q 24:45). Against\nthis interpretation, however, Speyer notes that the sperm- water figuring in Q 32:8, 77:20, and 86:6 is always\nqualified by an adjective (mahīn, dāfiq; BEQ 45). By contrast, Q 24:45 and 25:54 speak of creation from water\nwithout an adjective, in one case also with the definite article. Q 25:54 (mina l-m āʾi) shares both features with\nQ 21:30 (wa-j aʿalnā mina l-m āʾi kulla shayʾin ḥayyin), where reference to a primordial substrate is contextually\nappropriate. Overall, a primordial rather than seminal reading of Q 24:45 and 25:54 remains likely, in my view.\n10 The alternative to Paret’s construal would be to consider the statement that God’s throne was “upon the\nwater” (wa- kāna ʿarshuhu ʿalā l- māʾi) in Q 11:7 to detail a state of afairs following the creation of the heavens\nand the earth: God first generates the heavens and the earth, after which act he resides above the waters that are\nin turn located above the celestial dome (see Droge 2013, 133, n. 12). However, the parenthetical position of wa-\nkāna ʿarshuhu ʿalā l- māʾi deserves to be noted: God “created the heavens and the earth in six days— his throne\nbeing upon the w ater (wa- kāna ʿarshuhu ʿalā l- māʾi)—in order to put youp to the test, [in order to discern] which\none of you will act best (li-y abluwakum ayyukum aḥsanu ʿamalan).” The parenthetical status of the throne clause\ngoes well with Paret’s view that it forms a circumstantial clause.\n11 Awareness that Gen 1:1–2 could be read to imply creation from some sort of pre- existing matter persisted\neven after the emergence of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo: this is how the passage is interpreted by Julian the\nApostate, in an attempt to undermine Christian dogma, and also by a pagan phi los o pher figuring in a literary\ndebate with Gamaliel II in Gen. Rab. 1:9 (Niehof 2006, 45–46; Kister 2007, 250). On the possibility of reading\nGen 1:1–2 as expressing the idea of creation ex nihilo, see Bockmuehl 2012, 255. See also Kister 2007, 241–247,\nwho notes that Jubilees stresses that t here were no uncreated elem ents (VanderKam 1989, ch. 2:2: among the\nthings created on the first day were “the heavens that are above, the earth, the waters,” and “the depths”).\n12 Note, though, that some of this material, such as a passage from Tibat Marqe, identifies God as the creator\nof tōhû wābōhû.\nkhalaqa 275", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In fact, one cannot even take it for granted that Q 21:30 and 11:7 necessarily describe\none and the same scenario. It may be that Q 11:7 considers water to be the primal ele ment\nfrom which every thing else was derived, while 21:30 envisages an even more indeterminate\nand formless substrate of creation, similar to an oft- quoted statement from the Hellenistic\nJewish Wisdom of Solomon 11:17 that the “almighty hand of God” created the cosmos “out\nof formless matter” (ex amorphou hylēs; see May 1994, 6).16\nThough a definite solution remains elusive, it is nonetheless illuminating to further con-\ntextualise Q 21:30 with a homily on creation by Jacob of Sarug. Unlike the Qur’an, Jacob is\nexplicit that the cosmos came into being “from nothing” (men lā meddem; Mathews 2020,\n20–21, l. 1942; see also Mathews 2009, 22–29, ll. 133–135, ll. 139–140, and ll. 167–177, or\nMathews 2019, 12–13, l. 1575, and 14–15, ll. 1585–1586). But Jacob also stresses that what God\nfirst created was a “ great something” (meddem rabbā) that he describes as a primordial\nblend from which the “entire world” would subsequently come forth (Mathews 2009,\n46–47, ll. 363–368). In par tic u lar, Jacob stresses that the four elem ents fire, w ater, earth,\nand earth, despite being “contrary” (saqqūblāyē), w ere “mixed in” with one another before\nbeing assigned their natur al places according to Aristotelian cosmology (ll. 369–370). Jacob\nmoreover ties this original state of fusion to the statement in Gen 1:2 that “the earth was a\nformless void” (ll. 371–374). The primordial “ great something” from which every thing e lse\nwas fashioned, according to Jacob, looks similar to the original agglomerate envisioned in\nQ 21:30, even though in the Qur’anic case t here is no equivalent stress that the primordial\nmixture was brought into being ex nihilo. Jacob’s primordial “ great something,” of course,\nis not water but rather a fusion of all four ele ments.\n13 Other Qur’anic verses distinguish between two kinds of water, sweet and salty (Q 25:53, 35:12; see also\n27:61, 55:19–20, and 77:27). Conceivably, the primordial water that appears to figure in Q 11:7 contains both of\nthese empirical va ri e ties of water.\n14 Another verse that could be connected to the question of the primordial stuf on which the creator oper-\nated is Q 41:11, which describes a stage in the pro cess of creation at which the sky was still smoke (dukhān; see\nalso BEQ 15). However, this does not appear to be the ultimate substrate from which the sky was crafted, since\nthe previous verses mentions God’s creation of the earth and the mountains (vv. 9–10). Hence, the sky must\nalready have been fashioned prior to Q 41:11, and its being in a state of smoke or vapour must be a transitional\none, perhaps preceding the creation of the celestial bodies. Note that Q 44:10 predicts a day of reckoning on\nwhich the sky will emit smoke.\n15 As regards fire, several verses state that the jinn, or Iblīs in par tic ul ar, w ere created from it (nār; see Q 7:12,\n15:27, 38:76, 55:15). If the Qur’an considers primordial w ater to be the ultimate substrate of all created beings, the\nfire from which the jinn w ere fashioned would itself need to have emerged from w ater (perhaps by heating?).\nPlato’s Timaeus (56c–57c) puts forward an account of how at least some of the elem ents can be transformed\ninto others (e.g., water into fire); the hypothesis that fire, too, was created from primordial water is therefore\nnot impossible or anachronistic. Unfortunately, the Qur’an is silent on such subtleties of natu ral philosophy.\n16 This was also the view held by Philo; see Niehof 2006, 43–44, and also Kister 2007, 246–247.\n276 khalaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

No. Just as the Qur’an does not explic itly assert creation ex\nnihilo, so it does not unequivocally deny it: to borrow Markus Bockmuehl’s description of\nhow Jews and Christians ultimately came to understand the primal chaos portrayed in Gen\n1:1–2, it is not impossible to interpret the aboriginal state (or states) of afairs described\nin Q 11:7 and 21:30 as “already the product of the act of creation, rather than merely its\nmaterial cause” (Bockmuehl 2012, 255). This is, for instance, how al- Zamaksharī reads\nQ 11:7: the throne and the w ater must have been created prior to the heavens and the earth\n(Zam. 3:184; cf. also the traditions in Ṭab. 12:330–331). An equivalent reading of Gen 1:1–2\nis found in the poem on creation attributed to ʿAdī ibn Zayd (al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 103:3;\nsee Dmitriev 2010, 356–357).17 As for al- Zamaksharī’s interpretation of Q 11:7, it may be\nreinforced by noting that the divine throne, too, is nowhere in the Qur’an said to have\nbeen created, even though it seems clear that it must have been.18 Moreover, the Qur’an\nexplic itly calls God “the creator of all t hings” (khāliqu kulli shayˈin; Q 6:102, 13:16, 39:62,\n40:62), which prima facie militates against attributing to it the notion of an uncreated\nsubstrate.19 Even if none of this clinches the issue (perhaps the eternal substrate of God’s\ncreation is so amorphous that it does not strictly speaking qualify as “a t hing”?), it will\nmake one wary of employing arguments from silence in order to infer the uncreatedness\nof certain entities in the Qur’an ( whether it be the primordial waters from Q 11:7, the\nprimordial mixture from 21:30, or the divine throne).\nDespite such considerations, however, it remains arresting that the Qur’an lacks any\nunequivocal endorsement of creation ex nihilo at a time when the latter had come to be\nexplic itly affirmed as standard Christian doctrine and had also begun to manifest itself in\nthe rabbinic tradition: Gen. Rab. 1:9 has Gamaliel II reject a phi los o pher’s allegation that\nGen 1 represents chaos, darkness, w ater, and wind as uncreated raw materials of the divine\ncreator (Niehof 2006; Kister 2007, 247–256), and b. Ḥag. 12a includes formlessness and\nvoid (tōhû wābōhû), wind, and w ater among the ten t hings created on the first day of the\nhexaemeron (Kister 2007, 243–244).20 In contrast with such pre ce dents, the Qur’an—\nnotwithstanding its general stress on God’s power and supremacy (see u nder → qadīr)—is,\nminimally, conspicuously unconcerned to avoid the impression that God’s creation of the\ncosmos acted upon a pre- existing hylic substrate. The sense of surprise just formulated is,\nif anything, heightened by the fact that the Qur’an ste reo typically maintains that God’s\ncreation of the cosmos was accomplished “in six days” (Q 7:54, 10:3, 11:7, 25:59, 32:4,\n50:38, 57:4).21 This has an obvious Biblical background. The same goes for the Qur’an’s\n17 According to this poem, the hexaemeron began with a constellation of raging water, wind, and darkness\nthat was devoid of any rent (fatq) or gap (khalal); but as Dmitriev notes, this constellation of primal ele ments is,\nin the preceding verse, described as God’s “first signs,” which suggests that they are products of divine creation.\n18 The Babylonian Talmud, at least, explic itly declares God’s throne to have been created (b. Nәd. 39b).\n19 Cf. also Q 57:3, calling God “the first and the last,” and the discussion thereof u nder → ākhir.\n20 However, Niehof also notes that the doctrine of creation ex nihilo “is not systematically maintained\nthroughout Genesis Rabbah,” since Gen. Rab. 10:3 teaches that God “took two balls, one of fire and the other of\nsnow, and worked them into each other, and from these the world was created” (Niehof 2006, 47). On creation\nex nihilo in Judaism, see generally Kister 2007 and Bockmuehl 2012, who qualify the view that the doctrine of\ncreation ex nihilo “has no substantial foothold in Judaism prior to the M iddle Ages” (Bockmuehl 2012, 257). For\ninstance, according to Bockmuehl, already Qumranic texts show that “the covenanters’ belief in the supreme\nCreator God is thoroughgoing and all-i nclusive, so that all that exists was created by him” (Bockmuehl 2012, 263).\n21 Q 41:9–12 could be understood to imply that the primordial creation lasted eight days. For two attempts\nto reconcile this with the standard time span of six days, see BEQ 8–9 and KK 433.\nkhalaqa 277", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This emerges not only from the\nstatement in Q 54:49, quoted above, that God created every thing bi-q adar, “according\nto a specific mea sure,” but also from other creation references employing the verbs qad-\ndara, “to endow s.th. with mea sure” (Q 10:5, 25:2, 36:39, 41:10, 73:20, 80:19),23 and sawwā,\nperhaps “to endow s.th. or s.o. with an even or uniform shape” (Q 2:29, 15:29, 18:37, 32:9,\n38:72, 75:4.38, 79:28, 82:7, 87:2, 91:7; see CDKA 142).24 Again, one might draw attention to\nQ 75:38, where khalaqa and sawwā jointly designate God’s transformation of an embryo\n(or a “clot of blood”) into a fully formed h uman (see similarly Q 82:7 and 87:2). The same\nstress on the form and order of the created world may also be in play where God’s creative\nactivity is described with the verb ṣawwara, “to shape” (Q 3:6, 7:11, 40:64, 59:24, 64:3), even\nif t here is good reason to posit that this word refers specifically to God’s shaping of h umans\nin par tic u lar (see under → istakhlafa). Only in the post- Qur’anic period did this Qur’anic\nconcept of creation as a bestowal of mea sure, shape, and form become “radicalised” (van\nEss 2017–2020, 4:505) into the notion of origination from nothingness. This will almost\ncertainly have occurred due to contact with Christian theology, where the idea was, on the\nwhole, conceptually explicit e arlier than in rabbinic Judaism.\nShould one say, then, that the Qur’an simply prioritises an emphasis on the marvellous\nand perfectly crafted structure of the existing cosmos over an emphasis on the absolute\ndependence of all things on God alone? Another look at Jacob of Sarug illustrates that\ncreation ex nihilo is by no means incompatible with stressing God’s wise bestowal of shape\nand form on the cosmos (see, e.g., Mathews 2009, 48–49, l. 385, and 50–51, l. 396). Hence,\nthe puzzle to which the lack of endorsement of creation ex nihilo in the Qur’an gives rise\nis not fully solvable in the way just intimated; especially given the demonstrable imprint\nof Syriac Christian traditions on Qur’anic eschatology (Sinai 2017a), it remains the case\n22 On istawā, see also the remarks under → allāh.\n23 In addition to the passages listed in the main text, see also Q 77:23, for which t here is a widespread read-\ning variant qaddarnā instead of qadarnā (MQQ 8:37; MQ 10:244–245). This is contextually very appropriate,\nalthough therefore hardly the lectio difficilior. In any case, the second- form verb qaddara does not accord with\nthe participle al- qādirūn at the end of the verse. The tradition does mention an isolated and anonymous second-\nform reading al- muqaddirūn (MQ 10:245), which obviously involves a divergence from the canonical rasm and\nmay have arisen as a secondary attempt at aligning the received text with the second-f orm reading qaddarnā.\nOne might contemplate the possibility that Q 77:23 is simply employing the first- form qadara in the causative\nsense of qaddara, but t here is no reason for resorting to poetic licence h ere, as muqaddirūn would have suited\nthe operative rhyme perfectly well (note that Q 77:24 ends in mukadhdhibīn).\n24 Note that Q 91:14 uses sawwā in the context of divine destruction rather than creation, as in 91:7. At\nQ 26:98, sawwā X bi-Y is used in the distinct though related meaning of “to deem X to be the equal of Y.”\n278 khalaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Given\nthis tension with con temporary Christian thought, the Qur’an’s non- committal stance\non creation ex nihilo is perhaps one among several features of Qur’anic theology that are\nbest placed against a Jewish rather than a Christian background (see also u nder → isrāʾīl).\nAfter all, in the rabbinic tradition an extensive adoption of Greek concepts, which arguably\nunderpins the idea of creation ex nihilo, took place only under the impact of post- Qur’anic\nIslamic thought. An alternative theory would be to surmise that the Qur’an resonates\nwith pagan Arabian notions of cosmic creation, though t here is precious l ittle we can say\nabout what these may have looked like. Be that as it may, the Qur’an’s comparative lack of\nconcern with driving home that divine creation proceeded ex nihilo does not entail that\nthe Qur’an therefore accepts “the archaic sense that there existed a consubstantiality\nbetween God, nature, and man,” to employ a formulation by Francis Oakley (Oakley\n2006, 54): the Qur’anic creator unmistakably stands over and apart from the world he\ncreates, in so far as he is “the Lord of the heavens and the earth and what is between\nthem” (e.g., Q 19:65; see under → arḍ).\nDivine creation as an ongoing reali ty. One impor tant feature of the Qur’anic under-\nstanding of divine creation that deserves more detailed comment is the fact that the Is-\nlamic scripture has a strong tendency to portray divine creation as an ongoing and pre sent\nreal ity rather than simply as a series of foundational acts in the primordial past (see also\nunder → allāh). Thus, when reference is specifically to the creation of h umans, God’s cre-\nation is not confined to his fashioning of Adam from clay at the beginning of the world (e.g.,\nQ 15:28 and 55:14) but extends to subsequent generations, for the gestation of human fetuses\nin the maternal womb, too, is conceived as an act of divine creation rather than merely as\nthe unfolding of an autonomous natu ral chain of causes and efects (e.g., Q 2:228, 19:9,\n23:14, 53:45–46, 77:20; see Peterson 2001, 472, 476; HCI 173–174). Echoes of such a view\nare already found in pre-I slamic poetry (Sinai 2019b, 28–29), and the idea that the forma-\ntion of a h uman fetus was an instance of divine creation seems to have been shared by the\nQur’an’s pagan opponents (Q 43:87; QP 54). Still, the Qur’an’s tendency to envisage God as\ncausally involved in many natur al pro cesses goes much further and inclines t owards what\none might call an occasionalistic understanding of nature that attributes a host of seemingly\nordinary occurrences to direct divine causality (see u nder → allāh). Indeed, even the mere\nmaintenance of t hings as they are requires divine involvement: God holds in place (amsaka)\nthe heavens and the earth (Q 22:65 and 35:41), and he is the one ensuring that birds remain\npoised in mid-a ir (Q 16:79, on which see Decharneux 2019, 259–263). God is thus continu-\nally engaged (cf. Q 55:29) in “preserving” the heavens and the earth, without being wearied\nthereby (Q 2:255: lā yaʾūduhu ḥifẓuhumā; Peterson 2001, 472), and heaven and earth only\n“subsist by his command” (Q 30:25: an taqūma l- samāʾu wa- l- arḍu bi- amrihi; Baljon 1958,\n9). A basic intuition of the Qur’an, therefore, is that the ongoing operation and existence of\nthe cosmic edifice rests on its active preservation (Q 2:255: ḥifẓ) by God. It is arguable that\nthe Islamic version of atomism whose foundations w ere laid by Abū l-H udhayl (d. 841; see\nvan Ess 2017–2020, 3:241–264 and 4:514–534) is, at bottom, a bona fide attempt to explicate\nand articulate this scriptural motif.\nCreation and resurrection. Besides highlighting God’s entitlement to gratitude and\nworship (e.g., Q 87:1–4; see Peterson 2001, 472), a primary function of Qur’anic references\nto divine creation is to repel doubts about the real ity of a universal judgement at the end\nkhalaqa 279", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is not, in other words, a tenable position to concede a divine creator of\nthe cosmos, as the Qur’an’s adversaries in the Meccan surahs seem to have done (→ allāh),\nyet deny that this divine creator will act as an eschatological judge, since the resurrection\nand the last judgement require nothing more of God than a renewed exercise of the same\ncreative powers that God is so amply displaying already in the pre sent. Later Meccan pas-\nsages express the claim of an integral link between God as creator and God as resurrector\n(on which see generally O’Shaughnessy 1985, 70–89) by describing God’s bringing h umans\ninto existence as the “first time” he created them, implying that their resurrection equates\nto nothing more than a second creation (Q 6:94, 18:48, 41:21: khalaqnākum/khalaqakum\nawwala marratin; 17:51: faṭarakum awwala marratin; 36:79: anshaʾahā awwala marratin;\nsee also awwal khalq / al-k halq al-a wwal in 21:104 and 50:15 and al- nashʾah al-ū lā in 56:62).\nOther verses declare, to the same end, that God “creates to begin with and then re creates”\n(Q 10:4.34, 27:64, 29:19, 30:11.27: yabdaʾu/yubdiʾu ±​<llāhu> l- khalqa thumma yuʿīduhu;\nsimilarly 21:104 and, more elliptically, 85:13; see also under → aḥyā).25\nA dif er ent terminology appears in Q 50:15, which contrasts “the initial creation” (al-\nkhalq al-a wwal) with “the new creation” (khalq jadīd): “ Were we wearied by the first\ncreation? Yet they are uncertain about a new creation.” The only other verses in which the\nresurrection is termed a “new creation” are in fact objections attributed to the Qur’an’s\nadversaries (Q 13:5, 17:49.98, 32:10, 34:7). This makes it probable that Q 50:15 should\nlikewise be understood to reflect the language of the Qur’anic opponents, as if the verse\ncontained implicit quotation marks: “Yet they are uncertain about [what they call, pre-\nsumably scoffingly,] a ‘new creation.’ ” The inference is substantiated by the fact that the\nQur’an’s own voice employs the term khalq jadīd in a slightly dif er ent sense, namely, in\norder to designate the prospect of a punitive replacement of pre sent creatures with o thers,\nwho may prove worthier (Q 14:19, 35:16: in yashaʾ yudhhibkum wa- yaʾti bi- khalqin jadīd;\ncf. the variants in 4:133 and 6:133). What Muhammad’s adversaries term a “new creation”\ncorresponds, in the Qur’an’s own diction, to an eschatological “recreation” of humans\n(aʿāda + khalq) or to the “the final bringing-f orth” (Q 29:20: al- nashʾah al-ā khirah; Q 53:47:\nal-n ashʾah al-u khrā; → ākhir). Hence, it is at least occasionally pos si ble to discriminate\nrather clearly between the language of the Qur’an or the Qur’anic preacher, on the one\nhand, and that of his opponents, on the other. Incidentally, the Qur’anic opponents’ use\nof the expression khalq jadīd has a fairly accurate parallel in a statement by Jacob of Sarug,\nwhich also links the notion of a “new creation” with the reconstitution of individual h uman\n25 At least Q 10:4 and 30:11 make it explicit that recreation serves the purpose of meting out rewards and\npunishments or of “returning” humans to their divine judge. One is accordingly entitled to assume that what\nGod re creates are the same humans whom he created initially.\n280 khalaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Per-\nhaps the Qur’anic doubters picked up the term “new creation” from Christian missionary\npreaching and then used it in a sarcastically inflected fashion in utterances casting doubt\non the claim of an eschatological reconstitution of defunct, decomposed, and dispersed\nhuman bodies.26\nkhalāq | share\nFurther vocabulary discussed: ummī | s criptureless, not hitherto endowed with a scrip-\ntural revelation b araʾa tr. | t o create (s.th.) a l- ākhirah | w hat is final or last, the final\nstate of things, the hereafter\nQ 2:102.200 and 3:77 threaten vario us kinds of p eople with having “no share in the here-\nafter” (mā lahu fī l- ākhirati min khalāqin or lā khalāqa lahum fī l- ākhirati). The noun\nkhalāq also occurs, in the general sense of “portion, share,” in Q 9:69, where it refers to\npeople’s “share” of goods in the pre sent life. Khalāq may reasonably be suspected of being\na loanword, given that it stands apart from the other wise prevalent semantics of the Arabic\nroot kh- l- q to do with creation (thus in the Qur’an; see under → khalaqa) or, outside the\nQur’an, with smoothness or with being old and worn out (AEL 800). Moreover, the word’s\nmorphological pattern faʿāl is usually associated with verbal nouns (e.g., fasād, dhahāb)\nand adjectives (e.g., jawād, jabān).\nWhat might be the word’s ancestor, then? Syriac ḥelqā means one’s allotted fate\n(FVQ 124–125; SD 460) and does not appear to be used in an eschatological context.\nInstead, at least at Q 2:102.200 and 3:77 the Qur’an’s diction is convincingly linked with\na rabbinic turn of phrase (BEḲ 87; Hirschfeld 1902, 114; JPND 198–199; FVQ 124–125;\nBEQ 459). The latter is exemplified, for instance, by a Mishnaic declaration that all of\nIsrael have “a share (ḥēleq) in the world to come (la- ʿolam ha-b a),” followed by a cata-\nlogue of vari ous groups of sinners said to have “no share in the world to come” (m. Sanh.\n10). The expression “a share in the world to come” (ḥēleq la- ʿolam ha-b a) has two more\noccurrences in the Mishnah (m. Abot 3:11 and m. Sanh. 6:2) as well as a great number\nof further attestations in the Tosefta (e.g., t. Sanh. 9:5), the two Talmuds (e.g., b. B.\nMәṣ. 59a), and Genesis Rabbah (e.g., Gen. Rab. 1:5). Hence, Q 2:102.200 and 3:77, while\ncertainly reflecting rabbinic diction, are unlikely to be a targeted allusion specifically\nto m. Sanh. 10.\n26 Describing the resurrection as a “new creation” recalls God’s creation of a new heaven and a new earth that\nis predicted in Isa 65:17 (see also Isa 66:22). Two other parallels are 1 Enoch 72:1 (Charlesworth 1983, 50), 2 Baruch\n32:6 (Charlesworth 1983, 631; both are pointed out in O’Shaughnessy 1985, 85), and 4 Ezra 7:75 (Charlesworth\n1983, 539). Still, all of t hese passages refer to a moment of creative renewal on a cosmic scale, rather than to a\nrecreation specifically of deceased humans, as in Q 13:5 etc. (even though 4 Ezra 7:75 at least is concerned with\nthe posthumous fate of h umans). The parallel from Jacob of Sarug is thus considerably stronger. Crone notes\nthat Christians reserve the term “new creation” for the resurrection of Christ (e.g., 2 Cor 5:17: “So if anyone is in\nChrist, t here is a new creation: every thing old has passed away; see, every thing has become new!”; QP 148–149);\nbut this needs to be qualified in light of the citation from Jacob (for which o thers may be able to marshal further\nparallels). It must be said, though, that the latter also uses the expression “new creation” in connection with the\nresurrection of Christ (Kollamparampil 2008, 12–13, l. 51).\nkhalāq 281", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

To be sure, one may query\nwhy Hebrew ḥēleq should become Arabic khalāq. As regards the long ā vowel, Horovitz\nnotes that the Hebrew word corresponds to Jewish Aramaic ḥulaqa (DJPA 191; DJBA 439),\nwhich is morphologically closer to the Arabic form (JPND 198–199). Like Hebrew ḥēleq,\nAramaic ḥulaqa is employed to refer to an individual’s share in this world and in the next\nin the so- called Second Targum on the book of Esther (ḥulaqa b- ʿalma haden wa- b- ʿalma\nd- ate; Grossfeld 1994, 42 = Esther 2:7; Ego 1996, 88; the passage is pointed out in JPND\n198–199).1 As regards the transition from word- initial ḥ to kh, there is at least some evi-\ndence that such a shift was not impossible: Arabic khardal, “mustard” (Q 21:47, 31:16), is\ndescended from Aramaic or Syriac ḥardlā (Fraenkel 1886, 141; Pennachio 2013, 94), and\nArabic khamr, “wine” (e.g., Q 2:219, 5:90–91), is generally derived from ḥamrā (Fraenkel\n1886, 160–161; FVQ 125–126; Pennachio 2013, 91–92). In sum, it seems safe to posit that\nthe word khalāq was employed, and very likely coined, by Arabophone Jews in order to\nrender a common rabbinic idiom about the prospect of salvation in the world to come.2\nLike → ummī, “scriptureless,” or baraʾa, “to create” (→ khalaqa), khalāq would seem to\nbe a case of the Qur’an employing terminology current among the Medinan Jews.\nWhat about the second component of the khalāq formula, namely, → al-ā khirah, the\nstandard Qur’anic expression for the hereafter? It cannot be regarded as certain that Jews\nin the Qur’anic milieu, in Arabising the Hebrew phrase ha- ʿolam ha-b a or its Aramaic\nequivalent, had recourse to al-ā khirah. Rather, it may be that the Qur’an is h ere resorting\nto its own established nomenclature for the afterlife, whereas the original Jewish version\nof the khalāq formula ran diferently.\nkhāfa tr. | to fear or be afraid of s.th. or s.o.\nkhāfa intr. | to be afraid\nkhawf | fear\n→ ittaqā\n1 Attempts to date the text have ranged from the fourth century to around 1200 CE, but Beate Ego has as-\nsigned it to the late seventh or early eighth century (Ego 1996, 21–25, with a survey of earlier views; see also the\npassing assessment in Kister 2018, 401). In any case, even if the work cannot without further ado be considered\nto be pre- Qur’anic, it may safely be ruled out that the formulation u nder consideration betrays Islamic influence.\n2 Against the need to posit a loan, one might point out that Safaitic has a derivative of the same root—\nnamely, ḫlqt—in the sense of a period (i.e., a “portion”) of time (Al- Jallad 2014b, 223–224, citing C 974 and\nC 2820). Moreover, the classical lexica report that Arabic khalaqa can signify mea sur ing and determining the\nproportion of a thing (AEL 799–800). Still, the morphological similarity between khalāq and its suggested\nAramaic ancestor as well as the contextual similarity between the Qur’anic and rabbinic phrases are compelling\nindications supporting a linguistic loan.\n282 khāfa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Unlike this-w orldly benefits, such ranks of eschatological\nrecompense are said to be apportioned on the basis of moral merit.\nMen occupy a “rank above” w omen. Q 2:228 says that w omen have both rights and ob-\nligations, as determined by what is customarily recognised to be right and proper (lahunna\nmithlu lladhī ʿalayhinna bi- l- maʿrūfi), but goes on to add that men nonetheless occupy a\n“rank” above them (li- l- rijāli ʿalayhinna darajatun; see Bauer 2015, especially 168). What this\nmeans is further clarified in Q 4:34: men “are maintainers of w omen (al- rijālu qawwāmūna\nʿalā l- nisāʾi) by virtue of the fact that God has favoured some of them over o thers (bi- mā\nfaḍḍala llāhu baʿḍahum ʿalā baʿḍin) and by virtue of what they spend of their possessions\n(wa-b i-m ā anfaqū min amwālihim).”2 Unsurprisingly for a premodern text, the Qur’an\npresupposes that gender relations are hierarchical, at least in the par tic ul ar historical milieu\naddressed by Muhammad’s proclamations (see generally Bauer 2015 and succinctly Cook\n2014, 171). Q 2:228, cited above, and other verses, such as the miscellaneous commandments\npertaining to the treatment of w omen in Surah 4, make it clear that this does not mean\nthat w omen are stripped of concrete and substantial rights and entitlements. Nor are they\ndenied the status of fully fledged religious and moral subjects (Rahman 2009, 49–50), as\nillustrated by the fact that the assurances of eschatological reward in Q 3:195, 4:124, 16:97,\nand 40:40 contain the explicit proviso “ whether male or female” (min dhakarin aw unthā).\nThe same point emerges from Q 33:35, promising divine forgiveness and wage to “men and\nwomen who surrender themselves, men and w omen who believe” e tc. (inna l- muslimīna\nwa- l- muslimāti wa- l- muʾminīna wa- l- muʾmināti . . .).\nStill, such religious equality does not lead to an explicit demand that existing disparities\nbetween men and w omen be abolished. Thus, women are expected to be obedient to their\nhusbands (Q 4:34, especially the phrase fa-in aṭaʿnakum), and the Qur’an even permits\nhusbands, as an ultima ratio, to enforce this expectation by physical vio lence.3 Moreover,\nthe testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man, ostensibly because she is consid-\nered to be more prone to error (Q 2:282: an taḍilla iḥdāhumā fa-t udhakkira iḥdāhumā\nl- ukhrā; see Rahman 2009, 48–49); and with regard to the division of inheritances Q 4:11\nlays down the general princi ple that daughters inherit half the share of sons (li- l- dhakari\nmithlu ḥaẓẓi l- unthayayni).4\nSocio- economic hierarchies in general, including slavery. The pronouncements on\ngender relations just surveyed illustrate that the Qur’an assumes, as a factual given, that\nhuman individuals and collectives difer in social status, control over economic resources,\nand po litic al clout. God’s rationale for creating such disparities is made explicit in Q 6:165:\nGod “has raised some of youp over others in rank in order to test you with regard to what\nhe has given you” (rafaʿa baʿḍakum fawqa baʿḍin darajātin li- yabluwakum fī mā ātākum).\nIn equality and disparities in social, economic, and po liti cal rank, one may explicate, form\n2 My rendering of qawwāmūn is inspired by Bauer 2015, 10 (see also ibid., 169).

It is noteworthy how unapologeticically the verse just cited\nattributes human in equality to the creator. The Islamic scripture does not expressly raise\nthe prob lem that such divinely produced in equality might be felt to be incompatible with\nGod’s justice or goodness (see also u nder → ẓalama). The reason for this is clearly that the\ntemporary circumstances u nder which h umans undergo the moral testing that determines\ntheir lot in the afterlife are considered to be of no ultimate importance.\nThat the God- given disparities between h umans include economic diferences in par tic-\nul ar is highlighted in Q 43:32: it is God who has “distributed” p eople’s “livelihoods among\nthem in the proximate life (qasamnā baynahum maʿīshatahum fī l- ḥayāti l-d unyā), and\nwe have raised some of them over o thers in rank (wa- rafaʿnā baʿḍahum fawqa baʿḍin da-\nrajātin), so that they may compel one another to work (li- yattakhidha baʿḍuhum baʿḍan\nsukhriyyan).” A literal rendering of the phrase li- yattakhidha baʿḍuhum baʿḍan sukhriyyan\nis “to take one another as a sukhrī,” with the noun sukhrī—s aid to mean “someone who is\ncompelled to work without recompense” (AEL 1324)—b eing explicable with reference to\nthe verb → sakhkhara, “to make s.o. or s.th. subservient to (li-) s.o.” (thus in Ṭab. 20:586).5\nMore concretely, the phrase I have translated as “so that they may compel one another to\nwork” has been interpreted as referring to the contrast between f ree persons (al- aḥrār) and\nslaves (al-ʿ abīd; Muq. 3:794; cf. Ṭab. 20:586). This reading coheres with the fact that the\nQur’an is clearly cognisant of the distinction between f ree persons and slaves, for Q 2:178\nstipulates that the law of talion or retaliation (al- qiṣāṣ) in cases of murder is to be applied\ndiferentially based on l egal status: “a freeman for a freeman (al-ḥ urru bi- l-ḥ urri), a slave for\na slave (wa- l-ʿ abdu bi- l-ʿ abdi), and a w oman for a w oman (wa-l -u nthā bi-l -u nthā).”\nSlavery— i.e., owner ship of a human person by one or more other person or persons\n(see Q 16:75, containing the expression ʿabd mamlūk, and also 39:29)—is of interest in the\npre sent context b ecause it constitutes the most extreme case of socio- economic in equality,\nwhich is presumably why it is singled out for mention in Q 43:32.6 The institution of slavery\nas one aspect of the world created by God is also taken for granted in Q 16:71: “God has\nfavoured (faḍḍala) some of you over o thers in provision (→ rizq); and t hose who have\nbeen favoured do not pass on their provision to that which their right hands possess (mā\nmalakat aymānuhum)”—i .e., to their slaves—“ such that they would be equal with regard to\nit” (fa- hum fīhi sawāʾun). That the Qur’an presupposes slavery as a social real ity, in the same\nway in which it presupposes the real ity of gender-b ased disparities, is further confirmed\nby multiple other Qur’anic verses containing commandments relevant to the treatment\n5 Ittakhadha sukhriyyan must not be confused with the similar- sounding expression ittakhadha sikhriyyan,\n“to ridicule or mock s.o., to treat s.o. as a laughing stock” (Q 23:110, 38:63). For a brief discussion of how Q 43:32\nfigures in discussions about social in equality in premodern Islamic culture, see Crone 2004, 341–342.\n6 For an erudite and comprehensive examination of slavery in Islamic law and practice, see Brown 2019.\nBrown rehearses the difficulties confronting attempts to forge a definition of slavery that is universally and\ntranshistorically applicable. But as Brown also points out, the Islamic tradition is quite close to the Western one\nin conceptualising slavery as hinging on the legal status of being owned in contrast to that of being “ free” (cf.\nQ 2:178). It is impor tant to bear in mind that, as Brown demonstrates, the legal status of being owned by another\nperson can have very dif er ent concrete implications, depending on the concept of property that is operative in\na given culture and the way in which this concept is applied to human persons in par tic u lar. In any case, Q 16:75,\nby paraphrasing an “owned servant” as someone who “has no power over anything” (lā yaqdiru ʿalā shayʾin),\nshows that being owned by another person is assumed to place extraordinarily grave limitations on personal\nagency.

Such passages include, for example, the\ninstruction that unwed members of the Qur’anic community may be married, or o ught\nto be married, to righ teous male and female slaves (Q 24:32: al- ṣāliḥīna min ʿibādikum\nwa- imāʾikum; cf. 4:25 and also 2:221).7 The Qur’an also stipulates that the manumission\nof slaves, or of believing slaves in par tic u lar, provides a way of expiating certain sins like\nunintentional manslaughter (Q 4:92, 5:89, 58:3). One passage pre sents manumission as\na paradigmatically charitable act, together with feeding orphans or the poor (Q 90:13).\nManumitting slaves—in Qur’anic idiom, “freeing” or “releasing” a “neck” (taḥrīr/fakk\nraqabah)—is thus deemed a deed of high moral merit. Moreover, Q 24:33 prohibits the\nbelievers from forcing slave girls into prostitution (Cook 2014, 173).\nWhy might God have allowed or even intended slavery to arise? Given that, according\nto Q 6:165, social in equality (w hether manifesting itself in relations of bondage or in social\ndisparities between men and w omen) is a divinely ordained moral test, the most likely an-\nswer is that slavery provides h umans with an opportunity to acquire moral merit or to atone\nfor misdeeds by undertaking acts of manumission and also of ordinary kindness t owards\nslaves, like vario us other categories of socially vulnerable persons (e.g., Q 4:36). This does\nnot, on the other hand, warrant imputing to the Qur’an a positive demand that institution-\nalised bondage be retained or that it be restored once abolished. Modernist interpreters\nlike Fazlur Rahman have gone further and maintained that Qur’anic injunctions to manumit\nslaves, like the restrictions that the Qur’an places on the practice of polygamy (see Q 4:3.129),\nformulate a “moral ideal t owards which the society was expected to move” (Rahman 2009,\n48): immediate abolition of polygamy or slavery not being a realistic possibility, the Qur’an\nnonetheless expresses real dissatisfaction with the status quo. While this may be a feasible\nway of coming to terms with the tension between cont emporary values and the social reali-\nties of seventh- century Arabia reflected in the Qur’an, from a purely exegetical perspective\ntwo remarks must be made. First, and rather self- evidently, the modern idea that h uman\nsocial structures are dynamic and capable of being consciously reshaped and re- engineered,\nrather than falling into static patterns like natur al pro cesses, is not overtly pre sent in the\nQur’an. Secondly, the Islamic scripture does not seem to demand, or indeed to consider it\npos sib le, that socio- economic inequalities in the pre sent world be eradicated altogether.\nThough its manifestations could perhaps change, verses like Q 6:165 imply that a mea sure\nof in equality and injustice is hardwired into the structure of pre- eschatological h uman soci-\nety, serving to confront h uman agents with sufficiently challenging circumstances in order\nto be able to demonstrate a real commitment to abiding by the moral demands that God\nmakes of them. Even if the Qur’an does not explic itly rule out that specific historic forms\nof in equality and exploitation could and should be overcome, from the vantage point of\nQur’anic theology one would predict that alternative forms of in equality and exploitation\nwill then take their place. In other words, and again unsurprisingly, the Qur’an does not\nenvisage a social utopia this side of judgement day.\nDisparity and in equality as a feature of cosmic order.

This alludes to the frequent Qur’anic theme that the world is optimised for h uman\nhabitation and that the divine creator has made plants and animals subservient to h uman\nneeds (see in more detail u nder → arḍ). Significantly, t here is no suggestion in Q 17:70 that\nthe favour received by humankind is due to h uman superiority.\nAs far as disparities among h umans themselves are concerned, the gifts unequally ap-\nportioned by God are not l imited to material goods but also include religious favours. Thus,\nafter describing how Abraham discovered the existence of a divine creator transcending\nthe heavenly bodies, Q 6:83 pre sents Abraham’s God- given “argument” (ḥujjah) as exem-\nplifying the general truth that God “raises in rank whomever he w ills” (narfaʿu darajātin\nman nashāʾu; see also 12:76). The Israelites too are said to have been “favoured” by God\n“over the world- dwellers” (Q 2:47.122, 7:140, 45:16: faḍḍaltukum/faḍḍalakum/faḍḍalnāhum\nʿalā l-ʿ ālamīn), by having received “the scripture” and prophecy but also divine provision\n(Q 45:16). Having been “favoured over the world- dwellers” is also predicated of a line of\nindividual figures from Biblical history, such as Ishmael, Lot, David, and Solomon (Q 6:86,\n27:15). Even within the exclusive group of God’s messengers it is said that he has “favoured\nsome of them over others; to some of them God has spoken, and some of them he has raised\nin ranks” (Q 2:253: faḍḍalnā baʿḍahum ʿalā baʿḍin minhum man kallama llāhu wa-r afaʿa\nbaʿḍahum darajātin; cf. also 17:55).\nAll such instances of divine favour (faḍl), it must be reiterated, are not necessarily based\non any intrinsic merit of the receiving party. This impor tant insight has been lucidly formu-\nlated by Sarra Tlili (Tlili 2012, 229; see also ibid., 232–233): “God’s faḍl refers to the bounties\nthat He extends to humans purely out of His generosity and not in return for deeds they\nperform or because of personal merit they possess.” Disparities in divine favour between\nhumans or other beings in the world are not, or at least not unfailingly, amenable to being\nrationalised in terms of the immanent desert or merit of the advantaged party over the\ndisadvantaged, though this is not to deny that the Qur’anic God w ill most definitely punish\nsinners already in the pre sent world rather than just in the hereafter (see u nder → istakh-\nlafa, → ʿadhdhaba, and → afsada). But the general focus of Qur’anic statements about\nthis-w orldly divine favours is not on what qualifies someone to receive a certain amount of\ndivine blessings but rather on the way in which the recipients of divine favour w ill respond\nto it—to wit, whether they will show appropriate gratitude to God and whether they are\nprepared to share the bounties they have generously received with persons who have fared\nless favourably, through charitable giving (see u nder → razaqa, → zakāh, and → ṣadaqah).\nThis is why the Qur’an can maintain both that the Israelites have been divinely “favoured\nover the world- dwellers” yet deny the claim imputed to Jews and Christians that they are\nespecially “beloved” to God (Q 5:18, also discussed u nder → allāh): while God has be-\nstowed manifold blessings on the Israelites, such as granting them prophets and delivering\n8 On the Qur’anic assumption that certain theological truths are mirrored or prefigured in the natur al world,\nsee also under → ajal.\ndarajah 287", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Apparently commenting on the stipulation\nthat dif ere nt groups of heirs are to receive dif ere nt inheritance shares (Q 4:32–33; see also\n4:11–12.176),9 the verse impresses upon the Qur’anic believers the general princip le that\npeople must not “covet that by which God has favoured some of you over o thers (wa- lā\ntatamannaw mā faḍḍala llāhu bihi baʿḍakum ʿalā baʿḍin): men have a share of that which\nthey have accrued and w omen have a share of that which they have accrued.” To be sure,\none may “ask God for some of his favour (faḍl),” as a l ater segment of the verse says, mean-\ning that one may hope and petition God for a greater share of inner-w orldly bounties. But\nin equality and disparity being a universal feature of the natur al and social world, h umans\nmust not feel envy and rancour t owards t hose who have received greater blessing. Instead,\nhuman agents are to set their sight on attaining eschatological reward and a high rank in\nthe hereafter, a theme examined in the next and final section of this entry.\nThe hierarchy of socio- economic fact and the hierarchy of eschatological merit.\nAs Q 17:21 declares, God has “favoured” some humans over others (unẓur kayfa faḍḍalnā\nbaʿḍahum ʿalā baʿḍin)— one may add: with regard to inner-w orldly goods—y et “the hereaf-\nter holds higher ranks and greater favours” (wa-l a-l -ā khiratu akbaru darajātin wa-a kbaru\ntafḍīlā). What is of ultimate consequence, then, are not the ephemeral amenities by which\nGod has contingently singled out some individuals over others in this world but to merit\npreferment in the afterlife. In addition to socio- economic disparities, which form a hier-\narchy of brute and contingent fact, the Qur’an accordingly assumes a hierarchy of ethico-\nreligious merit, corresponding to dif er ent ranks in the hereafter. As Q 3:162–163 affirms,\nthose who strive to please God are not equal to t hose who incur divine anger (v. 162), and\npeople will accordingly “have [dif er ent] ranks with God” (v. 163: hum darajātun ʿinda\nllāhi). These eschatological ranks, unlike socio- economic ranks in the pre sent world, will\nbe allocated according to the merits or demerits that individuals have accrued during their\nearthly lives: “for every one there are ranks determined by what they have done” (Q 6:132\nand 46:19: wa- li- kullin darajātun mimmā ʿamilū).\nAs one would expect, those who believe and do righ teous deeds will have “the highest\nranks” (Q 20:75: fa- ulāʾika lahumu l- darajātu l-ʿ ulā). But there also seem to be diferences\nof rank among the believers themselves. For instance, God “favours in rank” (faḍḍala . . .\ndarajatan) those who “contend (→ jāhada) by means of their possessions and their lives”\nover t hose who remain sitting at home (Q 4:95–96; cf. also 9:20), and according to Q 57:10,\nthose who have “spent and contended before the decisive success (al-f atḥ)”—m eaning\nprob ably before the conquest of Mecca10— are “greater in rank” than those who only did\nso afterwards. It follows that disparities of merit among believers must correspond to dif-\nfer ent levels of eschatological reward. It is true that the Qur’an is never quite as explicit as\n9 Note also the proximity of Q 4:32 to 4:34, partially quoted above.\n10 See CDKA 207 and KK 167 (on Q 7:89). The word’s basic meaning would seem to be “decision” (as in\nQ 8:19, 26:118, 32:28–29), which secondarily developed into the sense of a decisive success or victory that God\nbestows upon (li-) the believers or Muhammad (e.g., Q 4:141, 5:52, 48:1, 110:1).

Hence, when\nQ 8:4 promises the true believers, whose virtues are enumerated in vv. 2 and 3, “ranks\nwith their Lord” (lahum darajātun ʿinda rabbihim), this would seem to mean that dif ere nt\ndegrees of ethico- religious merit entail dif er ent degrees of eschatological recompense.\nThe same understanding is plausible for Q 58:11, promising that God will “raise” t hose who\nbelieve and have been given knowledge “in [dif er ent?] ranks” (darajāt). That paradise\ncomprises dif er ent ranks or o rders, incidentally, is also asserted by Ephrem (Beck 1957a,\nDe Paradiso, no. 2:10–13), and the vocabulary he employs in this context includes the Syriac\nword dargā, obviously a cognate of Arabic darajah.\nThe two hierarchies just distinguished— a this- worldly hierarchy of socio- economic\nprivilege, which is at least to some degree bestowed arbitrarily, and a hierarchy of merit\nleading to eschatological recompense— exist in parallel. No necessary link obtains be-\ntween the one and the other; and not letting the former distract one from the latter\nis crucial if one is successfully to pass the moral testing to which God subjects human\nagents. At the same time, it is surely no coincidence that the Qur’an understands both\nthe pre- eschatological world and the hereafter to consist of hierarchical tiers, just as the\neschatological antithesis of salvation and damnation is prefigured by the pervasiveness\nof dualities in the pre- eschatological cosmos, such as the opposition of day and night or\nof male and female (see also under → ajal). A similar mode of thought may be discerned\nwhen Ephrem maintains that the ranked configuration of paradise has vario us typological\nprefigurations in sacred history, such as Noah’s ark (Beck 1957a, De Paradiso, no. 2:13).\nIn the Qur’an, the stratified nature of nature and human society similarly anticipates the\nstratified nature of the hereafter.\nEventually, of course, the eschatological hierarchy of merit will override the earthly\nhierarchy of socio- economic privilege, and on occasion the Qur’an stipulates behavioural\nnorms that ensures that this crucial axiological fact becomes vis i ble already in the pre sent\nworld: believing slaves, w hether male or female, are better than f ree men or women who\nassociate other beings with God, which is why the former make for preferable spouses\n(Q 2:221: wa-l a-a matun muʾminatun khayrun min mushrikatin, wa- la- ʿabdun muʾminun\nkhayrun min mushrikin); and in so far as the distinction between free persons and slaves\nis transcended by the common bond of being believers (Q 4:25: baʿḍukum min baʿḍin;\nsee Brockopp 2006, 57), it is pos si ble for believing freemen to marry believing slave girls,\nand also conversely for believing f ree women to marry believing male slaves (Q 24:32). By\nattaching at least some tangible social consequences to the notional equality of believers\nqua believers, such statements go somewhat further than Paul’s affirmation in Galatians\n3:28 that “ there is no longer Jew or Greek, t here is no longer slave or free, there is no\nlonger male and female; for all of you are one in Christ Jesus”: although rhetorically more\nrousing than Q 4:25, it seems quite unlikely that Paul’s declaration was meant as a demand\nfor the implementation of complete social equality between men and women or slaves\nand freemen.\ndarajah 289", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This makes “the proximate life” an acceptable En glish equivalent of s imple al- dunyā\nas well,1 and it permits rendering the phrase fī hādhihi l- dunyā (Q 7:156, 11:60, 16:30,\n28:42, 39:10), combining al-d unyā with a demonstrative, as “in this proximate life.” A\nmore idiomatic rendering would be “the pre sent life,” but this has the disadvantage of\nobscuring that dunyā— the feminine of adnā (“nearer, nearest”; see Q 30:3 and 53:9)—is\na spatial rather than temporal term. Another translation of al-d unyā that is frequently\nencountered in En glish translations of the Qur’an is “this world.” While this can be a le-\ngitimate translational choice, it is impor tant to stress that no Qur’anic passage explic itly\ndescribes the pre- eschatological stage of h uman existence and the afterlife as a sequence\nof two “worlds” (Greek: aiōn, Hebrew: ʿolam, which would correspond to ʿālam in Arabic;\nsee in more detail under → ākhir).\nThe use of al-d unyā in poetry and by the Qur’an’s pagan opponents.

Yet Bravmann’s spatial understanding\nof the line (“They are men of noble striving, from a stem that leaves the near-by region and grows forth into\nthe distance”) is well substantiated by other verses cited by him that invoke the same heroic trope of striking\nout into the geo graph i cal distance. These parallels include a verse from the Lāmiyyat al- ʿarab attributed to al-\nShanfarā that contains the expression dhū l-b uʿdah (Bravmann 1972, 33), which el Masri renders as someone\nwho “subscribes to ‘the beyond,’ ” meaning “one whose concern is for the future or what lies beyond immediate\nconcerns in general, not the ‘ here and now’ of the dunyā” (el Masri 2020, 98–99).

On\nthe face of it, the Qur’an might here be putting its own diction into the mouth of Muham-\nmad’s adversaries. But it is equally conceivable, and in accordance with the occurrence\nof al- dunyā in poetry, that the Qur’anic resurrection deniers did indeed operate with\nthe term al- dunyā, without employing it as what Izutsu calls a “correlation word” that\nimplies its counterpart al- ākhirah, just as “husband” implies “wife” (GMK 85).4 Instead,\nit would seem that it is only in the Qur’an that this correlation becomes established.\nThe Qur’anic deployment of al-d unyā or al- ḥayāh al- dunyā in opposition to al- ākhirah\n(e.g., Q 2:86.114.130.200 etc., 23:33, 42:20, 43:35), which emerges as a per sis tent feature\nof Qur’anic language only after the early Meccan period, thus induces a dichotomy that\nreplicates similar oppositions in New Testamental and rabbinic language, which are dis-\ncussed elsewhere (→ ākhir).\nreason against simply glossing dhū l- buʿdah as “ ‘one who covers great distances’ (and exposes himself to danger\nin doing so)” (thus EAP 1:173–174).\n3 Zuhayr no. 9:33 is discussed and accepted as au then tic in el Masri 2020, 329 (see also Jacobi 1971, 94–95).\nThe verse has ḥayyun mina l- dunyā, “somebody alive in this world.” By contrast, el Masri is sceptical about the\nauthenticity of Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 63:13 (which includes the hemistich tamattaʿ mina l- dunyā fa- innaka fānin,\n“Enjoy this world, for you s hall pass away”). However, el Masri’s contention that the ninth- century philologist\nal- Sukkarī singled this verse out as having been “added l ater by al-A ṣmaʿī” (el Masri 2020, 333) does not seem to be\ntrue; al- Sukkarī merely notes that vv. 13 f. are specific to the recension of al-A ṣmaʿī, without casting any express\ndoubt on the latter’s editorial integrity (wa- rawā baʿdahu l- aṣmaʿiyyu; Abū Suwaylim and al- Shawābkah 2000,\n505). El Masri’s supplementary observation that the language of the verse is “uncharacteristically flat” seems too\nsubjective to stand. It is true that the collocation of al- dunyā with m- t-ʿ is also Qur’anic (e.g., Q 3:14.185, 4:77, 9:38,\n10:23.70.98, 13:26, 28:60.61); yet the stress there is generally that the enjoyment of the “pre sent life” pales in com-\nparison to the final abode, a point that is not explic itly made in the verse attributed to Imruʾ al- Qays. It is pos sib le,\ntherefore, that the Qur’anic affirmations just illustrated rely on an established collocation of al- dunyā and m- t-ʿ\nas exhibited by the poetic passage, a collocation that the Qur’an recasts from an eschatological a ngle. Bravmann\npresumes that the verse in question is genuine but maintains that al-d unyā merely means “a life of plea sure” here\n(Bravmann 1972, 36). I am doubtful that this will do as an adequate translation but would emphatically second\nBravmann’s general point that dunyā should not automatically be presumed to presuppose al-ā khirah, and thus\nto have “religious”—or, more precisely, eschatological— implications. As regards ʿAntarah, no. 20:8 (expressing\nthe possibility that there might be fairer women than the poet’s beloved fī l- dunyā, “in this world”), this passage\nis likewise deemed “questionable” in el Masri 2020, 331–332, though only for the somewhat generic reason that\nthe poetry of ʿAntarah is “notoriously suspicious.” The verse is part of al- Aṣmaʿī’s recension of the poetry of ʿAn-\ntarah that has recently been re- edited on the basis of several manuscripts by James Montgomery (see no. 7:8 in\nMontgomery 2018a and 2018b). For two other relevant occurrences of al- dunyā, see Lyall 1913, no. 30:28 (also\ncombining al- dunyā and m- t-ʿ ), which is cited in GMK 87 (and rejected as inauthentic, due to textual uncertainty\nand overlap with Qur’anic phraseology, in el Masri 2020, 326–327), as well as Abū l-F araj al-I ṣbahānī 1927–1974,\n3:105 (l. 3 and also l. 7, first identified in Margoliouth 1925, 438).

By contrast, in early Meccan passages the noun dīn denotes\nthe eschatological judgement at which God will mete out eternal damnation or salvation\nbased on individual merit, an event for which the Qur’an employs both al- dīn and yawm\nal- dīn (e.g., Q 51:6, 70:26, 74:46, 82:9.15.17.18, 83:11, 95:7, 107:1).1 The curious fact that dīn\nconveys two distinct meanings in the Qur’an is to be explained by the confluence of two\nwords of dif er ent origin, namely, Aramaic/Syriac dīnā, “judgement,” and M iddle Persian\ndēn (BEḲ 44–45; KU 62; FVQ 131–133). Since dīn as an analogue of “religion” is attested\nin pre- Qur’anic poetry (→ dīn2), it would be wrong to suppose that this meaning of the\nArabic word was unavailable at the time of the early Meccan surahs. Instead, the exclu-\nsive prevalence in them of dīn = “judgement” is primarily indicative of the early Qur’an’s\ndominant preoccupation with eschatology.\nAlthough eschatological notions remain impor tant throughout the Islamic scripture,\nthe phrase yawm al- dīn and indeed any use of dīn to designate the eschatological judge-\nment disa ppear from Qur’anic usage in the l ater Meccan period: dīn = “judgement,” which\nis still found in Q 38:78, does not occur in any surah whose mean verse length exceeds 52\ntransliteration letters.2 Instead, l ater texts refer to God’s “reckoning” (→ ḥisāb) or the “day\nof resurrection” (→ yawm al-˻ qiyāmah), while Medinan texts additionally speak of “the\nfinal day” (→ al- yawm al-˻ ākhir).3 Dīn = “judgement” is thus a distinctively early Meccan\n1 On Qur’anic eschatology, see in more detail HCI 162–169 and Sinai 2017a, with further references.

Consequently, even after the early Meccan period the Qur’anic\ncommunity would have remained exposed to the early Qur’anic employment of dīn to\nmean “judgement.”\nJewish and Christian precursors. The Arabic phrase “judgement day” (yawm al- dīn)\nis continuous with previous Jewish and Christian usage. Its cognate counterpart yawmā d-\ndīnā occurs in the Syriac New Testament (El-B adawi 2014, 189–190), e.g., in Matt 10:15 and\n11:22.24 or 2 Pet 2:9 and 3:7, in all of which it renders Greek hēmera kriseōs. Yawmā d- dīnā\nis also common in later Syriac works, such as the writings of Jacob of Sarug (Sinai 2017a,\n258), and is found in rabbinic lit er a ture (DJBA 530).

Nonetheless,\nthe Arabisation of yawmā d- dīnā into yawm al- dīn is likely to have occurred prior to the\nQur’an, most likely among Arabophone Christians and Jews. It is relevant in this context that\nearly Arabic can use the verb dāna to mean “to requite” (see GMK 221–222, citing a verse\nof poetry found in al-K haṭīb al- Tibrīzī 2000, no. 2:4, and the participle madīn, “judged,”\n“subject to judgement,” in Q 37:53 and 56:86; see also AEL 943).

In other passages, virtually all of which have a much higher mean verse length\nand are accordingly to be dated to the later Meccan period (e.g., Q 16:52, 29:65, 30:30.32.43,\n31:32, 40:14.26.65) or to the Medinan one (e.g., Q 2:132.193.217.256, 3:19.24.73.83.85), the\nword dīn approximates aspects of the modern notion of religion, which can therefore pro-\nvide a ser viceable translational analogue of the Arabic expression1—at least on the assump-\ntion that “religion” is not narrowly equated with what has been claimed to be the prevalent\nmodern understanding of the concept, namely, “a kind of inner disposition and concern\n4 On the phenomenon of lexical discontinuity between the early Meccan surahs and the rest of the Islamic\nscripture, see in more detail the final section under → kitāb.\n1 My use of the expression “analogue” h ere is inspired by Abbasi 2020, 190, who in turn draws on Jonathan Z.\nSmith.\ndīn 293", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The former instructs a generic Qur’anic believer to\ndemarcate himself (or herself) from the “repudiators” (al- kāfirūn; v. 1) by declaring that\nhe/she does not serve or worship (→ ʿabada) what the repudiators worship (vv. 2–5),\nculminating in the climactic utterance, “Youp have your mode of worship and I have mine”\n(lakum dīnukum wa- liya dīn). Q 110:2, meanwhile, alludes to the moment when h umans\nwill “enter into the worship of God (fī dīni llāhi) in crowds.” It is not clear, however, that\nmean verse length can be relied upon as a chronological indicator in the case of Surahs\n109 and 110 (HCI 131). If these two texts are disregarded, occurrences of dīn in the sense of\n“judgement” and occurrences in the sense of “religion” are only found in surahs separated\nby a substantial gap in mean verse length.3 Thus, dīn is not only a homonym in Qur’anic\nArabic, but faded out of Qur’anic use in one meaning and then, after some time, faded\nback into use with a new one.4\nA good introductory illustration of the Qur’anic employment of dīn in the sense of\n“religion” or “religious worship” is Q 40:26, where Pha raoh justifies his intention to kill\nMoses by expressing his alarm that the latter might “change the dīn” of the Egyptians\n(akhāfu an yubaddila dīnakum). However indeterminate the meaning of dīn may at first\nappear to be in this utterance, one would expect the word to have a more direct bearing\non some ele ments of Egyptian culture and society than others. Moreover, the ele ments\n2 Nongbri 2013 charts the emergence of the modern concept of religion and argues that it has no equivalents\nin ancient discourses, refusing to countenance it as an adequate rendering of Latin religio, Greek thrēskeia, or\nArabic dīn (on which see Nongbri 2013, 39–45). Nongbri’s book continues a line of thinking g oing back at least\nto Fitzgerald 2000, who deconstructs the concept of religion as a valid analytic category in cross- cultural inter-\npretation reaching as far as India and Japan. On this general question, I find myself squarely in agreement with\nBruce Lincoln’s statement that “the absence of a signifier does not imply the absence of the signified” (Lincoln\n2021, 71). As regards specifically the meaning of Qur’anic dīn, I would readily concede that it does not signify\nreligion in the privatised sense outlined in the quotation in the main text, a sense that requires drawing hard\nbound aries around an opposing domain of the secular; but I would dispute that this invalidates translating the\nword as “religion,” since the latter term, understood in a fairly unsophisticated everyday manner, surely includes\ncommunal ritual practice addressed to a deity or a plurality of deities, and in this sense can function as a reasonable\napproximation of Arabic dīn. An equivalence of dīn and religion is also denied in Ahmed 2016, 187–188, citing W.\nMontgomery Watt’s explanation that the Qur’anic concept of dīn denotes “a whole way of life.” In line with my\nreservations about Nongbri’s argument, I do not agree that this would disqualify rendering dīn as “religion”—at\nleast if a reasonable efort is made to allow for a notion of religion that does not, like post-E nlightenment Eu ro-\npean Christ iani ty, require as its counterpart the existence of a well- defined secular sphere that is to be rigorously\ninsulated from religious claims. For a general treatment of the Qur’anic and l ater Islamic understanding of dīn\nin the sense of religion, see Smith 1991, 80–118. On Qur’anic dīn in relation to the category of religion, see also\nDakake 2019, who accepts that dīn may correspond to “religion.” On the post- Qur’anic Islamic usage of dīn\nand of the adjectival opposition of dīnī vs dunyāwī, see Abbasi 2021 and Abbasi 2020, respectively, arguing that\n“premodern Muslims did indeed possess a concept akin to the modern sense of ‘religion’ long before the rise of\nthe modern West” (Abbasi 2021, 1).\n3 The chronologically latest occurrences of dīn = “judgement” are likely to be Q 26:82 (mean verse length\nof the surah: 36.71 transliteration letters), 15:35 (mean verse length: 43.12), and 38:78 (mean verse length: 51.98).\nBy contrast, the chronologically earliest occurrences of dīn ≈ “religion” are likely to be Q 30:30.32.43 (mean\nverse length: 87.2) and 40:14.26.65 (mean verse length: 89.2). Hence, the gap in mean verse length between\nthe two senses is minimally around 35 transliteration letters. This is substantial enough in order to be deemed\nchronologically significant.\n4 For a diachronic study attempting to trace how the Qur’anic employment of dīn can be seen as a pro cess\nof “progression of and accretion to its meaning,” see Haddad 1974 (citing p. 114).\n294 dīn", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, the fear that Pha raoh expresses by referring to the dīn of his sub-\njects in Q 40:26 is the fear that Moses— who was sent with “clear authority” and conveys\ndivine “truth,” according to Q 40:23.25— will undermine the Egyptians’ allegiance to\ntheir traditional gods and also to Pha raoh himself as a divine figure. This is not to rule\nout that the Qur’anic understanding of the dīn of the Egyptians may also encompass\nnorms governing relations between humans: at least according to one pos si ble construal,\nQ 12:76 says that Joseph would not have been able to “seize his brother according to the\nking’s dīn (mā kāna li-y aʾkhudha akhāhu fī dīni l-m aliki) had God not willed it.”6 But it\nis of course common for the gods to lay down how humans are to behave towards one\nanother and for violations of such rules to be deemed insults to their divine guarantors.\nOverall, “religion” and “religious worship” remain sensible glosses of the meaning that\ndīn would seem to convey at Q 40:26.\nPre- Qur’anic background. Dīn in the sense of “religion” or “religious worship” is cred-\nibly held to derive from M iddle Persian dēn (KU 62; CQ 34–35; FVQ 131–133; by contrast,\nGMK 225 prioritises an inner-A rabic derivation). According to one scholar at least, the\nAvestan word daēnā, from which Middle Persian dēn is borrowed, had by the Young Aves-\ntan period come to serve as a designation for the entire Zoroastrian system of rituals and\nbeliefs (Lankarany 1985, 149–158 and 170–171; more cautiously Rezania 2020, §§ 9–22).7\nSubsequently, Mani and his early successors in third- century Iran elevated the word dēn to\nan umbrella term for a range of dif er ent cultic practices, thereby leading to a “crystalliza-\ntion of the concept of ‘religion’ ” that was ultimately inherited by Islam (BeDuhn 2015 and\nRezania 2020, §§ 24–70 and 89–96; see also the classic treatment in Smith 1991, 92–102;\nfor a more sceptical note, see Nongbri 2013, 69–72). Unlike the third- century Zoroastrian—\nor, more accurately, Mazdayasnian— priest Kartīr, who left behind several inscriptions\n(see Skjærvø 2011; Smith 1991, 96–98; BeDuhn 2015, 263–266; Rezania 2020, §§ 71–74),\nManichaeans “did not avoid calling other traditions dēn, even in the context of critiquing\nthem; and therefore they could speak in the plural of dēnān” (BeDuhn 2015, 269; again,\nsee already Smith 1991, 94).8 In Pahlavi lit er a ture, at least some of which is post- Qur’anic,\ndēn means “both the entire religious tradition of Zoroastrianism, a Weltanschauung or\nworld- view in its most expansive sense, as well as signifying the corpus of sacred wisdom\nand learning” (Vevaina 2015, 214).\n5 Note that Q 40:26 has Pha raoh declare, immediately before the segment just cited, “I will kill Moses— let\nhim call upon his Lord (wa- l- yadʿu rabbahu)!”\n6 Izutsu renders the phrase “he could not have kept his b rother in the dîn of the Egyptian king” (GMK 224)\nand surmises that dīn means “obedience” here. This is a pos si ble meaning of the word, as shown by Zuhayr’s\nuse of the phrase fī dīni ʿamrin, “in a state of obedience to ʿAmr” (see below). I am nonetheless unsure that this\nmeaning applies at Q 12:76. My interpretation agrees with Paret 2001. Jones 2007 and SQ have “ under the king’s\nlaw,” similarly Zirker 2018.\n7 For further glimpses of the relevant scholarship, which is far too extensive to be reviewed h ere and also\ntranscends my competence, see Vevaina 2015, 213–214; Skjærvø 2015, 412; Lincoln 2021, 70–89.\n8 By contrast, Nongbri writes that Mani uses the plural of dēn to refer to “social groups, not disembodied\n‘religious’ systems” (Nongbri 2013, 69–70).\ndīn 295", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

By contrast,\nJefery identifies Syriac as the likely intermediary (FVQ 133; on the Syriac word, see also\nCiancaglini 2008, 152). However, it remains to be assessed how frequent Syriac dēn ac-\ntually is and w hether it was indeed employed as an umbrella term for dif er ent religious\ncommunities or systems of belief and cultic practice rather than being primarily associated\nwith the “dēn of magianism” (see SL 268 and the occurrences of dēn in Syriac martyr texts\ncited in Becker 2009, 322 and 325).9\nDīn in poetry. Although dīn in the approximate meaning of “religion” or “religious wor-\nship” does not come into view before the l ater Meccan surahs, it is attested in pre- Qur’anic\npoetry and must accordingly be assumed to have become established in Arabic prior to the\nQur’an. Thus, a poem by ʿUrwah ibn al- Ward mentions the “dīn of the Jews,” which the poet\ndismissively portrays as involving “crawling” (ḥabā) and “braying” (nahiqa; Nöldeke 1863,\nno. 13:1, referenced in KU 62). Nöldeke plausibly won ders w hether this could be a reference\nto prostration in prayer (Nöldeke 1863, 79, n. 1). Al-N ābighah al- Dhubyānī, meanwhile,\npraises the Christian Ghassānids for possessing a divinely granted scripture (majallah) and\na dīn that is upright or straight (wa- dīnuhum qawīmun; DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 1:24;\nsee also Sinai 2019b, 47, noting a variant)— a formulation that intriguingly foreshadows\nthe Qur’anic combination of dīn with an attribute derived from q- w- m, such as al- dīn al-\nqayyim (Q 6:161, 9:36, 12:40, 30:30.43, and 98:5; see also CQ 34–35). The term dīn also\noccurs with regard to pagan cults: an oath by Aws ibn Ḥajar swears “by Allāt and al-ʿ Uzzā\nand who adheres to their dīn (man dāna dīnahā), and by Allāh; verily, Allāh is greater\nthan they” (Geyer 1892, no. 11:2),10 while al- Nābighah says, in the context of embarking\non a pilgrimage journey, that “al-d īn has become our resolve (qad ʿazamā)” (DSAAP,\nal- Nābighah, no. 23:6; see also GMK 227–228 and Sinai 2019b, 54–55).11 A passage that is\nattributed, prob ably correctly, to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt describes the killing of a sacred\ncamel by the people of Thamūd as a disobedient assault on “the dīn” (tafattakati l- dīna\nʿutiyyan; Schulthess 1911a, no. 34:23 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 31:23; on the question of authentic-\nity, see Sinai 2011b and Seidensticker 2011b, 54–56). In addition, a poem attributed to Aws\nibn Ḥajar opposes al- dīn to al- qusūṭ, “injustice” (Geyer 1892, no. 32:7). A final prooftext\nby ʿAmr ibn Qamīʾah will be presented forthwith.\nTaken together, the preceding poetic prooftexts warrant the claim that dīn signifies a set\nof practices undertaken— and, as shown by Umayyah, taboos observed—in order to worship,\nimplore, sway, propitiate, retain the benevolence of, or other wise interact with some deity. It\nis quite apt, therefore, to gloss dīn as “a system of ritual practices,” with Izutsu (GMK 227).12 In\n9 Becker argues that in the texts analysed by him it is the concept of “fear” (deḥltā)—a nd not the term dēn—\nthat functions as a “general category to refer to both Christ ian ity and Zoroastrianism” (Becker 2009, 309). On\nthe other hand, the Syriac translation of Kalila and Dimna from Middle Persian seems to employ dīnīg < Middle\nPersian dēnīg (see SL 297 and Ciancaglini 2008, 152) to refer to an Indian ascetic or Brahmin, so apparently in\nthe general sense of a “man of religion” (Schulthess 1911b, 1:104–105.108–109; see also Schulthess 1911b, 2:209,\nn. 367). But would Syriac speakers who did not also have a command of M iddle Persian necessarily have perceived\ndīnīg as etymologically related to dēn?\n10 Dāna dīnan also occurs in Q 9:29 (lā yadīnūna dīna l-ḥ aqqi, “they do not observe the true religion”). Ac-\ncording to KU 62, dāna in the sense of observing or adhering to a dīn may be a secondary derivation from the noun.\n11 On ʿazama l- amru = ʿuzima ʿalayhi, see AEL 2037.\n12 Izutsu occasionally expands this paraphrasis by a reference to credal aspects when he speaks of dīn as\n“a w hole system consisting of a certain number of creeds and ritual practices that are shared by a community” or “a\nformal system of creeds and rituals” (GMK 228).

In so far as dīn refers to a set of traditionally\nestablished and socially approved behaviours, it is understandable that the poem by Aws\nibn Ḥajar can employ it as an apparent proxy for “virtue” or “piety.” References to the dīn\nof the Jews or that of the Ghassānids moreover suggest that the ritual behaviour in question\nwas understood to be communally shared and communally distinctive. All aspects of this\nsemantic hypothesis are very neatly corroborated by a passage from the dīwān of ʿAmr ibn\nQamīʾah: the poet has been driven away by his p eople despite the fact that “I see that my dīn\nagrees with theirs (wa- innī arā dīnī yuwāfiqu dīnahum) when they engage in [sacrificial?]\nrites (nasakū),13 both as to [the ofering of] firstlings (afrāʿuhā) and [other] sacrifices (wa-\ndhabīḥuhā); // and I am familiar with many other pilgrimage stations (manzilatin bi- l-ḥ ajji\nukhrā), which bring benefit (? nufʿah) and departure from which is not permitted” (Lyall\n1919, no. 2:9–10, with minor modifications of the translation).14\nBeyond a generic equation of dīn with “religion,” the poetic evidence thus supports\nunderstanding the word more specifically as referring to communal cultic practice, en-\ncompassing such diverse acts as prayer, pilgrimage, animal sacrifices, and the tabooing of\nanimals consecrated to a god (see similarly Goudarzi, forthcoming). When the term dīn\ncarries a possessive suffix referring to a deity (as in Aws ibn Ḥajar’s man dāna dīnahā, hark-\ning back to Allāt and al-ʿ Uzzā), reference is to the intended divine addressee or addressees\nof the rituals in question and the word connotes ritual allegiance. By contrast, when dīn\nstands in a possessive relationship with h uman individuals or collectives (e.g., dīn al- yahūd,\ndīnī, dīnuhum),15 this specifies the human subjects who habitually engage in the ritual\npractices at hand. The transreligious application of the term dīn to Judaism, Christ ian ity,\nand pagan cults, in line with Manichaean usage, deserves note. Dīn, it seems, is identifiable\nas a general dimension of human culture that may take a variety of specific forms.\nThe pre- Qur’anic usage of dīn does harbour some additional complexities. Thus, an elegy\nby Sāʿidah ibn Juʾayyah describes the poet’s ongoing grief by saying ʿāwadanī dīnī, “I am\nagain overcome by my habitual state” (Farrāj and Shākir 1963–1965, 1165, no. 4:2; the verse is\ncited in GMK 221).16 Dīn can thus have the sense of “custom” or “habit” (see also AEL 944).\nIn addition, dīn can signify “obedience,” “allegiance,” or “submissiveness,” corresponding\nto the verb dāna li-, “to obey s.o.,” “to serve s.o.,” “to submit to s.o.” (GMK 222–229; see also\nAEL 942 and 944). This acceptation is illustrated by a verse by Zuhayr (DSAAP, Zuhayr,\nno. 10:32), where fī dīni ʿamrin means “in a state of obedience to ʿAmr” (or “in the ser vice of\nʿAmr”), the king of al-Ḥ īrah (GMK 223). Th ere are dif ere nt ways of relating t hese additional\nmeanings of dāna and dīn (namely, “habit, custom” and “obedience”) to dīn as religion or\nmore germane to the term → millah; it is certainly the case that when the term dīn in a religious sense appears in\npoetry and is accompanied by specific details, the latter tend to relate to ritual behaviour (e.g., the per for mance\nof the pilgrimage or the “crawling” and “braying” that ʿUrwah ibn al- Ward attributes to the dīn of the Jews) rather\nthan to the espousal of doctrinal tenets. Izutsu also thinks that al-N ābighah’s wa- dīnuhum qawīmun (cited above)\nmay be employing dīn in the sense of personal faith rather than in re spect to the Ghassānids’ communal rituals\n(GMK 227). Yet he does not produce any poetry or Qur’anic material in which dīn must mean personal faith.

If we assume the latter to be a loan, w hether direct or\nindirect, of Middle Persian dēn, then it is conceivable that the connotations of established\ncustom and obedience to a superior that were latent in the idea of religious ritual subse-\nquently made it pos sib le for the noun dīn to be used in order to pick out t hese concomitant\naspects in par tic ul ar. Alternatively, one or both of the two additional meanings of dāna and\ndīn just discussed (“habit” and “obedience”) could have preceded the borrowing of Middle\nPersian dēn and perhaps even paved the way for it. Thus, we might envisage a native Arabic\nmeaning of dīn in the sense of “obedience,” “submission,” “ser vice,” onto which an additional\nmeaning, derived from M iddle Persian dēn, was secondarily layered.\nThe end result, in any case, is likely to have been a strong semantic colouring of the word\ndīn by associations of entrenched custom, on the one hand, and allegiance to a higher au-\nthority, on the other. Thus, rather than positing a clear semantic demarcation between dīn\nas religious practice (derived from dēn) and dīn as obedience (as assumed, e.g., in Donner\n2019, 136), it seems quite likely that t hese two significations would have blended into one\nanother when the issue at hand was obedience to or worship of a deity, with the one or\nthe other nuance being paramount according to the context at hand. A translator might\ncapture such fluid overtones by occasionally resorting to paraphrasis, and t here is bound to\nbe some scope for subjective decisions h ere. Thus, when Q 16:52 states lahu l- dīnu wāṣiban,\nthis could justifiably be rendered in more than one way: “it is to him [namely, God] that\nreligious worship/devotion/obedience/allegiance is always due” (cf. GMK 224).\nQur’anic usage. The semantic contours of dīn discerned so far match Qur’anic usage,\neven if the latter can only be adumbrated selectively h ere. (The question of the semantic\nequivalence or distinction between dīn and millah—b oth of which have been held to mean\n“religion”—is treated under → millah.) One pertinent observation, exemplified inter alia\nby Surah 109 (see above), is that dīn, when used in the general sense of “religion” or “re-\nligious worship” rather than “judgement,” often occurs in proximity to the verbs ʿabada,\n“to serve, to worship” (see Q 10:104, 12:40, 39:2.3.11.14, 98:5; see GMK 225–226) and daʿā,\n“to call upon” (namely, God; Q 7:29, 10:22, 29:65, 31:32, 40:14.65). This supports the view\nthat dīn signifies religion qua something that one does rather than qua something that\none believes. Moreover, in line with the poetic usage described above, in the Qur’an the\nword dīn frequently carries possessive suffixes referring to humans (e.g., Q 2:217, 3:24.73,\n4:146.171, 5:3.54.57.77, 49:16, 109:6), but can also stand in a possessive relationship with\nGod, in the phrase dīn allāh, “worship of God” or “religious obedience/allegiance to God”\n(Q 3:83, 24:2, 110:2). More precisely, dīn allāh might be paraphrased as “practices mandated\nby, and expressing exclusive allegiance to, God.” A fter all, the Qur’an clearly teaches that\ncertain modes of dīn, as opposed to o thers, are divinely commanded (Q 2:132, 3:19, 5:3,\n9:33, and 42:13),17 and it stipulates that ritual veneration or ser vice (al- dīn)—or, as one verse\nputs it even more explic itly, “religious worship in its entirety” (al- dīn kulluhu)— ought to\nbe addressed “to God” (li- llāhi) alone (Q 2:193, 8:39, 16:52, 39:3).18\n17 For an alternative perspective on Q 2:132, see Donner 2019, 136. Donner argues that dīn is here best read\nin the sense of “custom, “ser vice,” “obedience” (see Zuhayr’s fī dīni ʿamrin), which he considers to be the most\nfrequent meaning of the word in the Qur’an.

The crucial follow-on question then is to\nwhich of the vario us available candidates for religious worship human action and allegiance\nis to be properly and efficaciously directed. While the Qur’anic Messenger’s pagan oppo-\nnents spread worship out among a plurality of divine beings, the Qur’an urges that one’s\ndīn ought to be confined (akhlaṣa) to the one creator god, Allāh.\nAs illustrated by some of the preceding passages, the Qur’an can employ al- dīn with\nthe definite article in a way that resembles the indefinite En glish term “religion,” namely,\nas the general label for a certain sphere of h uman beliefs and practices, or as a “genus”\nthat contains a number of dif er ent species (Dakake 2019, 347–348; see also the verse by\nUmayya ibn Abī l- Ṣalt cited above). For example, Q 42:21 poses the polemical question\nwhether the Qur’an’s opponents have partner deities or “associates” (shurakāʾ) who have\n“established for them precepts of religious worship that God has not permitted” (sharaʿū\nlahum mina l-d īni mā lam yaʾdhan bihi llāhu).20 The individual species contained within the\ngenus dīn would be the distinctive ritual traditions and customs of dif er ent communities,\nwhich individual h umans may decide to uphold, opt into, or opt out of. Thus, when Q 3:24\ncondemns some of the scripture- owners for the fabrications that have “deceived them in\ntheir religion” (gharrahum fī dīnihim mā kānū yaftarūn), “their dīn” comes close to “their\nreligion” in the sense of one par tic u lar religion among others, though a less reified trans-\nlation like “their mode of religious worship/allegiance” could still be defended. Similarly,\nQ 3:73 speaks of “ those who follow yourp mode of religious worship” or “religion” (man\ntabiʿa dīnakum). The frequency of dīn + possessive suffix referring to h uman individuals\nor collectives, noted above, confirms the impression that the general human activity or\ncultural dimension of dīn comes in a multitude of dif er ent inflections that are e ither indi-\nvidually or communally distinctive.\nUnsurprisingly, however, the Qur’anic religion is deemed to be more than one peculiar\nmanifestation of human religious practice and is labelled “the true mode of religious wor-\nship” or even “the true religion” (dīn al- ḥaqq, literally “the religion of truth”), in contrast\nwith “all [other] kinds of religious worship” (al- dīn kulluhu; Q 9:33, 48:28, and 61:9; see\n19 On akhlaṣa and its passive participle mukhlaṣ, see also under → shayṭān and CDKA 89. According to\nIzutsu, in the phrase akhlaṣa l- dīna/dīnahu li- llāhi “the word dîn cannot but mean personal faith in God” (GMK\n228). But it seems perfectly satisfactory to construe dīn as meaning “religious worship” here, although the point\nof the phrase is of course a personal commitment to abstain from serving beings other than God. Given that\nIzutsu does not advance any poetic or Qur’anic prooftexts in which dīn must refer to individual faith, Ockham’s\nrazor would seem to dictate that we make do with t hose meanings of the term that are unequivocally attested.\nThe phrase is also discussed in Haddad 1974, 117–119, who translates mukhliṣan/mukhliṣīna lahu l-d īna as “in total\ncommitment” or “in devoted commitment” to God.\n20 On the verb sharaʿa, see n. 34 under → aslama.\ndīn 299", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Other verses similarly pre sent al- islām\nas a par tic u lar, albeit decisively privileged, kind of dīn (Q 3:83.85, 4:125, 5:3; cf. also 2:132).\nHence, even though the Qur’an is plainly not envisaging all forms of human religion as\nequal, it does indeed position the “true dīn” squarely within a wider genus of human\nreligious activity, whose dif er ent manifestations are categorised as functionally and phe-\nnomenologically kindred phenomena.\nal- madīnah | the town\n→ arḍ, → hājara\n21 Q 24:25 utters a threat combining dīn and ḥaqq that is not straightforward to understand: yawmaʾidhin\nyuwaffīhimu llāhu dīnahumu l-ḥ aqqa. In light of the other Qur’anic occurrences of dīn al-ḥ aqq, one might inter-\npret this to mean that “on that day God w ill fully repay them for their [adherence or lack of adherence to the] true\nreligion.” Ambros notes the possibility of translating “ will repay them for [what they maintained to be] their true\nreligion” (CDKA 292; cf. also Paret 2001, giving two alternative translations of which the first one corresponds to\n“for the religion they truly endorse”). But it is more likely that dīn is here either synonymous with dayn, “debt”\n(CDKA 102), or that the consonantal skeleton d- y- n should be vocalised as dayn in the first place. The statement’s\nmeaning, then, would be that God w ill see to it that p eople’s “true debt” is “fully settled,” which in the context of\nQ 24:25 has the ominous purport that God will unfailingly exact any outstanding moral dues (see also Q 24:39,\nwhich says in a similarly threatening context that God will “fully settle” an unbeliever’s “account,” fa- waffāhu\nḥisābahu). This reading of Q 24:25 corresponds to the alternative translation given in Paret 2001 (“wird Gott ihnen\nihre wahre Schuld (?) voll heimzahlen”). Unfortunately, consultation of two modern qirāʾāt encyclopaedias does\nnot produce evidence that a variant reading dayn ever existed (see MQ 6:250–251 and MQQ 4:245). Still, the\nconjecture that d- y- n in Q 24:39 should be read dayn is attractive because it is text- critically plausible that the\npresence of al-ḥ aqq should have occasioned conflation with false parallels like Q 9:29.33.\n300 al- madīnah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Gen 22:13). With a view to presenting the circumstantial evidence in\nfavour of this claim, the pre sent entry will review the main terms associated with animal\nsacrifice in the Qur’an.\nVerbs referring to animal sacrifice (dhabaḥa, naḥara, qarraba qurbānan). The two\nQur’anic verbs designating the act of sacrificial slaughter are dhabaḥa and naḥara.

Given its early date, this command-\nment must endorse participation in the pre- Qur’anic Meccan cult (PP 108), in which the\nveneration of Allāh played at least some role (→ ashraka). The verb dhabaḥa— which is\nalready attested in Safaitic inscriptions (Al- Jallad 2015a, 312; Al- Jallad 2022, 17–26)—is\nsomewhat more frequent.

With regard to the Qur’an’s own pre sent, the verb dhabaḥa occurs in\nQ 5:3, prohibiting consumption of “that which has been slaughtered on sacrificial stones”\n(wa- mā dhubiḥa ʿalā l- nuṣubi; on sacrificial stones, see below).\nA third verbal phrase that is once used for the act of sacrifice is qarraba qurbānan\n(Q 5:27). The context of this occurrence— namely, the dif er ent oferings made by Cain\nand Abel, or Qur’anically speaking by “the two sons of Adam” (Q 5:27)— does not make it\nclear that reference is specifically to animal sacrifice; a fter all, Gen 4:3–5 specifies that Cain\nbrought “of the fruit of the ground,” whereas Abel “brought of the firstlings of his flock,\ntheir fat portions.” Other Qur’anic occurrences of qarraba do not refer to sacrifice and are\ngenerally translatable as “to bring s.o. or s.th. near” (Q 19:52, 34:37, 39:3), and the same goes\nfor the passive participle muqarrab (e.g., Q 56:11.88; see also u nder → azwāj ˻muṭahharah).3\nThe noun qurbān, on the other hand, means “sacrifice” not only at Q 5:27, but also at 3:183.\nHowever, it must have a dif ere nt sense at Q 46:28, where something like “way of approach-\ning” fits better, drawing on the root q- r- b’s connotation of nearness (CDKA 222; cf. Q 39:3\nand the line of poetry cited in Hussain 2020, 106–107). It seems clear that qurbān in the\nsense of “sacrifice” rather than “proximity” or the like is derived from Aramaic, prob ably\nSyriac (FVQ 235), and the same holds for Arabic qarraba = “to sacrifice,” seeing that this is\none of the established senses of Syriac qarreb (e.g., Beck 1970a, no. 2:1179).\nThus, in the context of the Biblical story of Cain and Abel, we find the Qur’an express-\ning the idea of sacrifice by means of what may be described as a Syriacism rather than\nby one of the two usual Qur’anic words for sacrifice (dhabaḥa, naḥara), which are also\nemployed— though not exclusively so—in contexts dealing with cont emporary Arabian\nsacrificial rites (e.g., Q 5:3). The suspicion that the occurrence of qarraba qurbānan in\nQ 5:27 is not coincidental is confirmed by the fact that 3:183, the other Qur’anic instance\nof qurbān in the sense of “sacrifice,” may also have a Biblical background (BEḲ 74). In fact,\nthe Aramaicising expression qarraba qurbānan is only one among a number of lexical and\nother similarities between the Qur’anic account of Cain and Abel, on the one hand, and\na number of Syriac texts elaborating upon the same events, on the other (Witztum 2011,\n143–144). The Qur’an thus documents that in late antique Arabic one and the same ritual\nact, animal sacrifice, could either be referred to with an expression that had a tangibly\nBiblical ring (qarraba qurbānan), and accordingly seems to have been used primarily for\nsacrificial acts in the Biblical past, or could be designated in a more generic fashion that\napplied to con temporary sacrificial rites as well (dhabaḥa, naḥara). This lexical dualism\nis reminiscent of the observation made elsewhere that the Qur’anic corpus attests two\ndistinct notions of holiness or sacrality, expressed by the roots ḥ-r -m and q-d -s , one of\nwhich is associated with cont emporary Arabian ritual life while the other has clear Biblical\nassociations (see under → ḥarrama and → qaddasa).\nSacrificial stones (anṣāb) vs idols (aṣnām, awthān). Sacrificial stones or altars (sin-\ngular: nuṣub, plural: anṣāb) are mentioned not only in Q 5:3, referenced above, but also\nin 5:90 and prob ably 70:43 as well.

RAH 101). Such parallels\nconfirm that the anṣāb w ere stones functioning as sacrificial altars. The nouns nṣb and mnṣb\n(with the variants mṣb and mnṣbt), “cult stone,” and the corresponding verb nṣb, “to set\nup a cult stone,” also occur in Safaitic inscriptions (Al- Jallad 2015a, 331).5 In the Hebrew\nBible, stones set up as altars and resembling the Arabian anṣāb are designated by the word\nmaṣṣēbâ (e.g., Gen 28:18.22 and Deut 7:5); both words would seem to be derived from the\nsame Semitic root n-ṣ - b, connoting erecting or raising up (RAH 101; QP 69; Chabbi 2020,\n468–469). Nabataean inscriptions similarly employ the words nṣb and mṣbʾ (Wenning\n2001, 80).\nIt is impor tant to note that sacrificial betyls of the kind referred to by Arabic nuṣub\nwould have difered in function and appearance from carved or hewn statues of deities,\nor idols, designated by the terms ṣanam and wathan (RAH 102). The word ṣanam is prob-\nably cognate with the Semitic root ṣ- l- m (FVQ 199; Scagliarini 2007, 255) and specifically\nwith the word ṣlm, “statue,” that is found in vari ous corpora of Arabian inscriptions, such\nas Epigraphic South Arabian, Nabataean, and Dadanitic (Scagliarini 2007, 253–255). The\nQur’anic usage of the plurals aṣnām (Q 6:74, 7:138, 14:35, 21:57, 26:71) and awthān (Q 22:30,\n29:17.25) is consistent with the understanding that they are functionally distinct from\nsacrificial stones: unlike the anṣāb, the aṣnām and awthān figure as objects of veneration,\nindicated by formulations such as ʿabada + acc., “to serve or worship s.o. or s.th.” (Q 14:35,\n26:71, 29:17) or ʿakafa ʿalā + gen., “to cling or be devoted to s.o. or s.th.” (Q 7:138, 26:71).\nThat Arabic awthān, what ever the word’s etymology,6 w ere repre sent a tions of some kind is\nalso indicated by a verse of al-A ʿshā Maymūn in which bayt al- wathan designates a Christian\nchurch or chapel, perhaps on account of the icons or religious statues it contained (→ al-\nnaṣārā). In the Qur’an, the terms aṣnām and awthān appear almost always in connection\nwith Abraham, in one case in connection with an idolatrous p eople— presumably corre-\nsponding to the Biblical Canaanites— encountered by the ancient Israelites (Q 7:138; see\nFVQ 199). Given their similar contexts of occurrence, predominantly the life of Abraham,\nthe Qur’an does not aford evidence of a palpable semantic distinction between aṣnām\nand awthān (against Chabbi 2020, 52; see also Linnhof 2020, 24–25 and 48).7 Th ere is one\nverse in which the awthān figure as a cont emporary real ity, Q 22:30, urging the Qur’anic\naddressees to “shun the impurity of idols” (fa-j tanibū l-r ijsa mina l-a wthāni). But it is\n4 On the latter verse, see Sinai 2019b, 53.\n5 It is by no means the case that Safaitic inscriptions containing t hese words always mention sacrifices.\nRather, at least sometimes the impression is that a mnṣb/mṣb is simply a memorial stone (e.g., KRS 2914 in Al-\nJallad 2015a, 264: “came upon the cult stone”). See Macdonald 2012, 291, who suggests that standing stones or\nanṣāb were set up “as an act of piety or as a memorial of an encounter with the divine, as in the story of Jacob\nafter wrestling with the angel”; subsequently, he suggests, such stones “may have come to be identified as rep-\nresenting the divine being.” Nonetheless, t here are also inscriptions whose authors “erected [a cult stone] and\nsacrificed” (HH 1 and JaS 100.1; see Al- Jallad 2022, 20 and 28–29, as well as krc . orient . ox . ac . uk / ociana / corpus/\npages / OCIANA _ 0052449 . html).\n6 Arabic wathan has a cognate in Epigraphic South Arabian (FVQ 286–287), for which Beeston et al. 1982,\n166, give the meaning “stela; boundary stone, boundary mark; boundary, frontier”; see also Scagliarini 2007,\n256.

Animals\ndestined to be sacrificed are called budn in Q 22:36 (which together with the following verse\ncontains sufficient detail in order to confirm that the word does indeed carry this sense).\nSomewhat less certain are the meanings of the collective noun hady and of the plural qa-\nlāʾid, which are coupled in Q 5:2.97, with hady also occurring in Q 2:196, 5:95, and 48:25.\nThe plural qalāʾid is usually taken to refer e ither to necklaces by which sacrificial animals\nwere marked out (e.g., in Arberry 1955) or to the respective animals themselves (KK 113 and\nCDKA 229). Al- hady too is normally understood to mean sacrificial animals, but given its\nliteral meaning “ofering” (cf. hadiyyah, “gift, pre sent,” in Q 27:35.36), hady could well refer\nto oferings in general, w hether votiver oferings or sacrificial animals. That hady at least\nencompasses the latter category, even if it may not be restricted to it, is suggested by Q 5:95.\nThe verse stipulates dif ere nt manners of atoning for the intentional killing of game while in\nthe pilgrim state, and the first option set out is that the culprit is to ofer up “livestock that\nis equivalent to what he has killed, as judged by two just men from among youp, by way of\nan ofering (hady) that is to reach the Kaʿbah” (fa- jazāʾun mithlu mā qatala mina l-n aʿami\nyaḥkumu bihi dhawā ʿadlin minkum hadyan bāligha l- kaʿbati). Q 48:25 condemns t hose who\nprevent oferings (al- hady) from reaching their maḥill; assuming that the latter word does\nindeed denote a “(lawful) place of slaughter of animals as a sacrifice” (CDKA 77; similarly,\nBadawi and Abdel Haleem 2008, 232), which is consistent with its occurrence in Q 2:196\nand 22:33, hady in 48:25 too would specifically refer to animal sacrifices. In view of all this,\nthe pair hady and qalāʾid in Q 5:2.97 may perhaps be understood to overlap rather than\ndenoting two distinct categories, and could be rendered “sacrificial oferings and animals\nmarked out by ritual necklaces.” Incidentally, animals in the Qur’anic milieu do not only\nseem to have been sacrificed but also to have been subject to other taboos, as entailed by\nthe conventional reading of Q 5:103 (on which see Gräf 1959, 58–59).\nA final root connected with sacrificial rites is n-s -k . Q 2:196 instructs t hose who are\nforced to violate the prohibition of shaving one’s head during the ḥajj to atone by means\nof a fast, a charitable gift, or a nusuk (fa- fidyatun min ṣiyāmin aw ṣadaqatin aw nusukin). It\nwould make contextual sense here for nusuk to refer to an act of sacrifice or to an animal\nsacrificed (cf. the use of nusuk in DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 10:24, cited above). In support of\nthe same conjecture one may also point to Q 6:162, combining the terms ṣalāh (→ ṣallā),\n“prayer,” and nusuk: “Say, ‘My praying and my nusuk, my living and my d ying are all de-\nvoted to God, the Lord of the world- dwellers’ ” (qul inna ṣalātī wa-n usukī wa-m aḥyāya\nwa- mamātī li- llāhi rabbi l-ʿ ālamīn). It is plausible to interpret the pair ṣalāh and nusuk here\nto refer to the two principal types of ritual worship that were presumably known in the\nQur’anic milieu, namely: prayer, in the sense of worship by means of words and bodily\nmovements such as prostration (→ sajada), and the ofering of sacrifices, in par tic u lar of\nanimal sacrifices.9\n8 Some translators render the noun → al-ṭ āghūt as “idols,” in which case one might cite some of the occur-\nrences of this word in support of the existence of idols properly speaking in the Qur’anic environment. However,\nas explained in the respective entry, it may be preferable to translate al-ṭ āghūt more abstractly as “false gods.”\nSee also Linnhof 2020, 32.\n9 Thus construed, Q 6:162 would parallel the coupling of prayer and sacrifice in 108:2, quoted above.\n304 dhabaḥa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Taking into account that the context of at least three of\nthese occurrences (Q 2:128.200, 22:34) is concerned with the Meccan “house” (→ bayt)\nor the ḥajj (→ ḥajja), it is also conceivable that a mansak is chiefly a rite associated with\na sanctuary; there is in fact reason to assume a degree of equivalence between mansak,\nmanāsik and the plural phrase shaʿāʾir allāh, “God’s observances” (see under → ḥar-\nrama), both of which are employed in close proximity in Surah 22 (Q 22:32.34.36; see\nalso 22:67).10\nThe Qur’an’s interiorisation of the rationale of sacrifice. The Qur’an evidently pre-\nsupposes an environment in which sacrificial ceremonies w ere a regular part of ritual life.\nUnlike Christ ian ity and rabbinic Judaism, the Qur’an admits animal sacrifice in the literal\nsense as a legitimate part of God’s cult. At the same time, one Medinan passage, Q 22:36–37,\nradically transforms the religious rationale of the sacrificial act in comparison to what we\nmay surmise it to have been in pre- Qur’anic ritual (Sinai 2019c, 135–136, n. 68; Christiansen\n2019, 138–139). Q 22:36 affirms that God has appointed sacrificial animals (al- budn) as part\nof his ritual observances (shaʿāʾir allāh) and calls upon the addressees to “invoke God’s\nname” upon them and to share their meat with other members of the community. Q 22:37\nthen adds that “neither their meat nor their blood reaches God (lan yanāla llāha luḥūmuhā\nwa- lā dimāʾuhā); rather, it is yourp pious fear that reaches him (wa- lākin yanāluhu l- taqwā\nminkum). Thus God has made them subservient to you (sakhkharahā lakum) so that you\nmay magnify God for the guidance he has granted you (li- tukabbirū llāha ʿalā mā hadā-\nkum).” Accordingly, the point of sacrifice is not to bestow a gift on the deity, who is re-\npeatedly said to be free from any needs (ghaniyy; e.g., Q 22:64; see under → ḥamd), but\nrather to manifest h uman piety: sacrificial animals have been made available to h umans so\nthat the latter might “magnify God” and also in order to provide an occasion for charitable\nsharing. An expressivist explication of the rationale of animal sacrifice, according to which\nthe practice is a ritual vehicle by which humans are able to manifest and externalise their\ninward piety, is also suggested by an e arlier verse in the same surah, Q 22:32, according\nto which re spect for “God’s observances” (shaʿāʾir allāh) is due to or indicates “pious fear\nin people’s hearts” (fa- innahā min taqwā l- qulūb). The essence of sacrifice, therefore, is\nnot to be located in the external act itself but rather in the inner disposition giving rise\nto it and finding expression in it. It is worth adding that similarly interiorising comments\non certain cultic acts, which emphasise that righ teous conduct (al- birr) is not identical\nwith par tic u lar outward observances, are found in two other Medinan verses, Q 2:177.189\n(which share the phrase laysa l- birra an / laysa l- birru bi- an . . . , “right eous conduct does\nnot consist in . . .”).11\n10 On Q 22:34.67, see under → ummah.\n11 Together with Q 22:32, t hese two verses are insightfully referenced in Paret’s concordance on Q 22:37 (KK\n350). Note that in the case of Q 2:177 at least (right eous conduct is not identical with observing a specific direction\nof prayer), the observance in question is one mandated elsewhere in the same surah (Q 2:144.149–150). Hence,\njust as Q 22:37 is not d oing away with sacrifices altogether but simply relativising the ultimate significance of\noutward ritual acts, so Q 2:177 is not revoking the commandment to pray t owards the Meccan sanctuary but is\nsimply relativising the significance of individual ritual acts in comparison to such long- term virtues as belief in\nGod etc., charity, regular prayer, almsgiving, honouring agreements, and patience in adversity.\ndhabaḥa 305", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Late antique Christians certainly denied\nunequivocally that God had any need of sacrifices, meaning that it is not surprising to find\nthe Qur’an anticipating potential objections to its endorsement of animal sacrifice. For\ninstance, Justin declares that “we have received by tradition that God does not need the\nmaterial oferings which men can give, seeing, indeed, that He Himself is the provider of\nall things” (First Apology 10 = Roberts et al. 1995, 1:165). The Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum,\nmeanwhile, is concerned to show that God’s true law did not comprise sacrifices, of which\nGod had “no need”; rather, sacrificial commandments w ere only imposed on the Israelites\nas part of God’s punitive “second legislation” in the wake of the Israelites’ worship of the\nGolden Calf (Vööbus 1979, 243–245).\nHowever, mainstream Christians, unlike the Marcionites, w ere committed to a scriptural\ncanon that included the Old Testament with its detailed sacrificial instructions. At least some\nChristians, therefore, did not find it attractive simply to dismiss all sacrificial rites as pointless\nor as being a potential instrument of divine punishment. Thus, a hymn by Ephrem addresses\nthe apparent contradiction between Biblical statements implying that God craved animal\nsacrifices, such as Gen 8:21, and others denying that he had any desire for or need of them\n(Beck 1957b, no. 30:2). Ephrem resolves the ostensible conflict by intimating an interpreta-\ntion of the Hebrew Bible’s sacrificial commandments that bears considerable resemblance to\nthe Qur’anic position outlined above, in so far as sacrificial rituals are valorised as a positive\ndivine gift to h umans rather than a h uman gift to God: God enjoined sacrifices in order to\nencourage h uman prayer and repentance, which tend to be concomitant with the ofering of\nsacrifices; and it was only due to such concomitant manifestations of h uman piety that God\nrejoiced in sacrifices (Beck 1957b, no. 30:10–12). Th ere is, accordingly, no question of God\nhimself deriving any benefit from sacrifices; rather, it was God who “by means of the sacri-\nfices aided the sinner” (Beck 1957b, no. 30:11; cf. also nos 32:3, 33:5, 36:13, 50:3). The Qur’anic\nexplication of the rationale of animal sacrifice in Q 22:36–37 may therefore be regarded as\ndrawing on theological resources that are ultimately rooted in Christian reflections on the\npurpose of Pentateuchal sacrificial instructions.\ndhurriyyah | offspring\n→ ab, → ummah, → rabb, → shayṭān, → azwāj ˻muṭahharah, → nabiyy\ndhakara tr. | to remember s.th. or s.o.; to heed s.th.; to mention s.th. or s.o.;\nto invoke s.o. or s.th.

Derivatives of the root dh- k- r (see generally CDKA 103–104) are particularly\nfrequent throughout the Qur’an. They can be grouped into two broad semantic clusters, one\nto do with h uman remembrance and invocation of God, treated in the pre sent entry, and a\nsecond one to do with God’s exhortation of humans, treated under → dhakkara. There is an\nevident theological complementarity between t hese two broad sets: as becomes particularly\nmanifest in Q 37:13, 74:54–56, and 80:11–12, God’s revelatory reminders (verb: dhakkara,\nnoun: tadhkirah) demand and call forth a h uman response involving, among other t hings,\ninward awareness of God as well as outward invocation of him (dhakara). In many cases, it\nis morphologically evident w hether a word belongs to one or the other of the two clusters\njust distinguished: thus, the first-f orm verb dhakara is mostly “to remember” or “to invoke”\nGod, applied to h umans as the grammatical subject, while the second-f orm verb dhakkara,\nin line with its causative connotation, is “to cause s.o. to remember,” “to remind s.o.,” with\nGod serving as the grammatical subject. A notable case of ambiguity, however, is constituted\nby the noun dhikr, which can both refer to the act of invoking God (discussed further below\nin this entry) and to the hortatory reminders that God addresses to h umans (in which sense\nit is discussed u nder → dhakkara). In the course of examining the Qur’anic use of the root\ndh- k- r, further ambivalences— e.g., the question when dhakara designates inward remem-\nbrance or outward invocation—w ill also need to be addressed.\nPrior to a more detailed review of Qur’anic occurrences of dhakara and dhikr in what\nfollows, it is relevant to note that the Qur’an’s numerous allusions to human remembrance\nand divine reminding interlock with the Qur’anic assessment that h umans are continually\ndisposed to “forget” (→ nasiya) God or vital religious truths. God, by contrast, does not forget\n(Q 19:64, 20:52) or, alternatively, w ill only forget h umans by way of a proportionate penalty\nfor their prior forgetfulness of him or of the last judgement (e.g., Q 7:51, 9:67). Interestingly,\nin the Qur’an it is almost never God who figures as the agent of the verb dhakara. The only\nexception to this is Q 2:152, where the divine voice declares, “Remember me, and I s hall\nremember youp” (fa- dhkurūnī adhkurkum); but even here divine remembrance of humans\nis merely invoked as God’s proportionate response to h uman remembrance of him, thus\ninverting the nexus of forgetfulness underscored in verses like Q 7:51 and 9:67.1 The Qur’an’s\nalmost complete lack of references to divine remembering (as opposed to divine remind-\ning, on which see u nder → dhakkara) is especially notable when compared against Arabian\nepigraphy. For instance, Safaitic inscriptions beseech Allāt to “remember” or “be mindful”\n(ḏkrt) of certain humans (e.g., AAUI 406 and JaS 189.2 in Al- Jallad 2015a, 221 and 252), and the\nAramaic part of the first- or second- century CE Ein Avdat inscription contains the petition\n“May he who reads this be remembered for good (dkyr b-ṭ b) before Obodas (ʿbdt) the god”\n(Macdonald in Fiema et al. 2015, 400). Similar pleas for divine remembrance continue in a\nmono thei stic context: a pre-I slamic inscription in Arabic script, dated to 548/549 CE and\nprob ably Christian, contains the formula ḏkr ʾl-ʾ lh + name, “May God remember . . .” (Nehmé\n1 For the responsive nexus between certain h uman actions and a divine response in kind, see Q 2:160 and\nother verses (predicating the verb → tāba both of humans and of God), 17:8 (wa-i n udtum ʿudnā), and 47:7 (in\ntanṣurū llāha yanṣurkum).

The most likely answer is that it is simply\ntaken for granted that God w ill “remember” or, more generally, be unfailingly aware of what\nhumans do: it is a prominent Qur’anic posit that God “has knowledge of all t hings” (bi- kulli\nshayʾin ʿalīm; e.g., Q 2:29.231.282, 4:32.176), and to ask God to “remember” specific h uman\nindividuals or collectives could easily have given rise to the misunderstanding that there was\na risk that he might other wise be forgetful of them.\nThe meanings of dhakara. The first- form verb dhakara can generally signify (i) the\nmental act of remembering or thinking of something or someone or (ii) its verbal expres-\nsion, the act of mentioning or speaking of something or someone. Meaning (i) is repre-\nsented, for example, by Q 7:69, 8:26, or 19:67, in all of which dhakara is “to remember, to\nthink of, to bear in mind” (CDKA 103). Three early Meccan passages, already referenced\nabove, employ dhakara immediately a fter an occurrence of the second-f orm verb → dhak-\nkara or its verbal noun tadhkirah (Q 37:13, 74:54–56, 80:11–12). Dhakara here designates\nthe appropriate h uman response to divine reminders and exhortation, and is therefore\nbest translated as “to heed s.th.,” a meaning other wise conveyed by the fifth- form verb\ntadhakkara (see under → dhakkara). This employment of dhakara is clearly related to\nmeaning (i), though h uman remembrance is not a one-t ime mental act here but rather a\npermanent stance of being mindful of God’s reminding exhortation, of living by it. The\nsecond basic meaning of dhakara— namely, “to mention”—is exemplified by Q 47:20,\nwhich condemns the less than enthusiastic way in which some community members react\nto a divine revelation “in which fighting is mentioned” (dhukira fīhā l- qitālu).\nBut dhakara can also carry the further meaning of (iii) mentioning or calling upon God\nin a ritual or devotional setting, that is, of “invoking” him. The earliest Qur’anic occur-\nrences of dhakara in this sense take “the name of yourS/his Lord” (isma rabbika/rabbihi)\nas their accusative object (Q 73:8, 76:25, 87:15; see also under → ism). Chronologically\nlater verses have the variant dhakara sma llāhi (“to invoke the name of God”) rather than\ndhakara sma rabbika/rabbihi (Q 2:114, 5:4, 6:118.119.121.138, 22:28.34.36.40, and 24:36). In\nthese later passages, the context is often the pronunciation of God’s name over (ʿalā) food\nand specifically slaughtered meat (thus in Q 5:4, 6:118.119.121.138, and 22:34.36). It would\nperhaps not be impossible to regard this invocatory usage of dhakara as an evolutionary\nofshoot of meaning (ii). However, the collocation of dhakara with God or God’s name\nclearly amounts to an Arabisation of Biblical diction (CQ 39), corresponding to the em-\nployment of cognate verbs like zākar or hizkîr in Biblical Hebrew (see TDOT 4:64–82).\nFor example, Deut 8:18 (pointed out in CQ 39) commands the Israelites to “remember the\nLord yourS God,” with zākar in the Hebrew text, dkar in Targum Onqelos, and etdakkar\nin the Peshitta.3 It will have been under the influence of these cognates, rather than by\nway of an in de pen dent semantic development of meaning (ii), that Arabic dhakara came\nto be used for religious invocation. Beyond such terminological links, it is not impossible\n2 Nehmé 2017 also documents vario us inscriptions in Nabataean script that contain the formula dkyr + per-\nsonal name, “May . . . b e remembered” (Nehmé 2017, 136–138, 141; see also Nehmé in Fiema et al. 2015, 417–421).\nBut these do not contain an explicit reference to a deity as the agent of remembrance.\n3 See also Isa 26:13, where the Hebrew text has hizkîr and the Peshitta again employs etdakkar, and cf.

After all, the early Qur’anic practice of vigils also bears resemblance\nto monastic prayer (see under → ṣallā).\nDhakara as a mere act of the mind? If it is the case that at least some occurrences of\ndhakara clearly refer to acts of the mind, as noted above, how sure can we be that other\nQur’anic verses do indeed use dhakara in the sense of outwardly invoking God, as assumed\nin the preceding paragraph, rather than merely in the sense of internal remembrance and\nmindfulness of God? At least for the phrases dhakara sma rabbika/rabbihi and dhakara sma\nllāhi, contextual observations suggest that they are indeed to be understood as outward\nand to some degree audible speech acts of “calling upon” God. Thus, Q 76:25 commands\nits addressee to engage in the activity described by dhakara sma rabbika “in the morning\nand in the even ing” (bukratan wa- aṣīlā). This rules out at least that reference is to a general\nattitude of being mindful of God. In princip le, morning and even ing prayer might of course\nhave taken the form of entirely s ilent meditation; but this would neither be in keeping with\nthe strong affinities between Qur’anic prayer, on the one hand, and Judaeo- Christian forms\nof prayer, on the other; nor would it sit well with the combination of dhakara sma llāhi\nwith the preposition ʿalā, which surely refers to the invocation of God’s name over food\nrather than to silent moments of inward remembrance. When Q 2:114 (on which see n.\n27 under → arḍ) and 22:40 associate the phrase dhakara sma llāhi with places of worship\n(masājid allāh), this too is likely a reference to the per for mance of communal rites and\nprayers that involve concrete speech acts.\nMore difficult to determine is the question w hether the predominantly Medinan formu-\nlation dhakara llāha, without reference to God’s name, should likewise be understood to\ndenote invocation as opposed to an interior state of God-a wareness (see Q 2:198.200.203.239,\n3:41.135.191, 4:103.142, 8:2.45, 22:35, 26:227,4 33:21.41, 62:10; the only Meccan occurrence is\n39:45, but see also 18:24, which has wa- dhkur rabbaka). A fter all, where dhakara takes as\nits object God’s “grace” (niʿmah, on which see u nder → anʿama; Q 2:40.47.122.231, 3:103,\n5:7.11.20.110, 14:6, 33:9, 35:3, 43:13),5 dhakara is fittingly translated as “to remember,” raising\nthe possibility that dhakara llāha too could be a m ental disposition or act. But at least for\nsome occurrences of dhakara llāha such a reading would clearly not be tenable. For instance,\nQ 8:2, 22:35, and 39:45 share the temporal clause idhā dhukira llāhu (“when God is men-\ntioned”) followed by a description of the response exhibited by the “hearts” (qulūb) of t hose\nwho believe (Q 8:2, 22:35) or who do not believe (Q 39:45).6 In all three cases, reference must\nbe to a speech act that is audible to o thers pre sent, although “to mention” seems contextually\nmore fitting than “to invoke” h ere. Similarly, in the Meccan verse Q 18:24 dhakara rabbaka\nmust mean “to mention” or “to invoke,” given that it describes the utterance of a short\nsupplication comprising the expression “my Lord” (rabbī; see below); and when Q 2:198\n4 Q 26:227 is very likely a Medinan insertion (GQ 1:127–128; Neuwirth 2010, 721–722; Neuwirth 2017, 397).\n5 Q 43:13 speaks of the grace of “yourp Lord” (niʿmat rabbikum) rather than of niʿmat allāh. Q 7:69.74 have\nālāʾ allāh, “God’s wondrous deeds” (see under → afsada).\n6 For other verses combining dhakara, dhakkara, or dhikr with a reference to h uman hearts (qulūb) besides\nQ 8:2, 22:35, and 39:45, see 5:13, 13:28, 17:46, 18:28.57, 39:22–23, 45:23, 50:37, and 57:16.\ndhakara 309", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

One\nverse, Q 7:205, combines dhakara rabbaka with the prepositional phrase fī nafsika, “in your\nsoul” (see u nder → nafs), which appears to signal that the type of invocation at hand cannot\nbe readily overheard: “And invoke yourS Lord in your soul, humbly and in fear, without rais-\ning your voice, in the mornings and in the even ings” (wa-d hkur rabbaka fī nafsika taḍarruʿan\nwa- khīfatan wa- dūna l- jahri mina l- qawli bi- l- ghuduwwi wa- l-ā ṣāli).

As intimated\nabove, a peculiar ambiguity besets the verbal noun dhikr and the genitive construction\ndhikr allāh (“God’s dhikr”). In many Meccan passages, dhikr means revelatory exhortation\nprovided by God rather than remembrance or invocation of God (→ dhakkara). However,\nin at least some Medinan instances of dhikr allāh (Q 5:91, 24:37, 62:9) God is clearly not\nthe subject of dhikr but rather its object, since these verses feature dhikr allāh in close\nconnection to prayer or ṣalāh (see also below and CDKA 104). Like Q 24:37, 63:9 too\nemploys dhikr allāh together with the verb alhā ʿan, “to divert from.” This commonality\nmakes it plausible to carry over the understanding of dhikr allāh as invocation of God to\nQ 63:9 as well. By contrast, the context of two other Medinan instances of dhikr allāh,\nin Q 57:16 and 58:19, does not suffice to rule out dhikr- as- exhortation. In fact, given that\nQ 57:16 coordinates dhikr allāh with mā nazala mina l- ḥaqqi, “what has come down of the\ntruth,” one may prefer to equate dhikr allāh with divine revelation here. In any case, for\nthose verses in which dhikr allāh is unlikely to refer to divine exhortation, the preceding\nremarks on dhakara llāha make it preferable to translate dhikr allāh as “invocation of God”\nrather than “remembrance of God,” in order to underline that the Qur’an is likely referring\nto a concrete act of invocation rather than merely to a general inward disposition to be\nmindful of God. Arabic dhikr is h ere equivalent to Hebrew zēker or Syriac dūkrānā, which\nin Biblical passages like Ps 30:5, 97:12 or 145:7 refer to the liturgical affirmation of God’s\nholiness or abundant goodness.\nInvocation and prayer (ṣalāh).

At Q 20:14, God commands Moses to invoke him in prayer (aqimi l- ṣalāta li-\ndhikrī), which suggests, minimally, that the activities of invoking God and of performing\nprayer show some overlap. This is also the obvious implication of Q 7:205 when read in\n7 I am grateful to Saqib Hussain for pointing out the relevance of Q 17:110 to understanding 7:205. For\nexplicit criticisms of ostentatious prayer, see Q 4:142 and 107:6. Ostentatious piety, though not specifically with\nregard to prayer, is also condemned in Q 2:264, 4:38, and 8:47, which employ riʾāʾa l- nāsi, “in order to be seen\nby people” (see under → ṣadaqah).\n310 dhakara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Pointing in the same direction, the Medinan passages\nQ 3:41 and 33:41–42 couple the injunction to engage in plentiful invocation of God (3:41:\nudhkur rabbaka kathīran, 33:41: udhkurū llāha dhikran kathīrā) with the injunction to\nutter prayers of praise (sabbaḥa; see under → ḥamd) “in the eve ning and the morning”\n(3:41: bi-l - ʿashiyyi wa-l -i bkār, 33:42: bukratan wa-a ṣīlā).8 In view of the similarity to the\nMeccan verse Q 76:25 (wa- dhkuri sma rabbika bukratan wa- aṣīlā; the following verse\nemploys sabbaḥa) it makes sense to interpret Q 3:41 and 33:41–42 as employing pleo-\nnasm and to construe invoking God and praising him as one and the same thing.9 The\nexistence of a three- way nexus between dhikr, praise, and prayer (ṣalāh) is implied by\nQ 24:36–37, according to which “men who are not diverted by commerce and trade from\ninvoking God, performing prayer, and giving alms” (lā tulhīhim tijāratun wa-l ā bayʿun\nʿan dhikri llāhi wa-i qāmi l- ṣalāti wa- ītāʾi l-z akāti) are engaged in praising (sabbaḥa) God\n“in the mornings and the eve nings” (bi-l -g huduwwi wa-l - āṣāl). That the regular diurnal\nprayer ritual counts as a form of dhikr allāh is supported by two further Medinan verses:\nQ 5:91 pairs dhikr allāh and al- ṣalāh, and 62:9 even employs the former as a synonym\nfor the latter: “O believers, when there is a call to prayer on the day of assembly (idhā\nnūdiya li-l - ṣalāti min yawmi l- jumuʿati), then hasten to the invocation of God (fa-s ʿaw\nilā dhikri llāhi).”\nOn the other hand, Q 4:103, also Medinan, would seem to imply some kind of dis-\ntinction between ṣalāh and invocation, and to position the latter as something that takes\nplace or may take place after or outside the former: “when youp have completed the\nprayer, invoke God standing and sitting and [lying] on your sides” (fa-i dhā qaḍaytumu\nl- ṣalāta fa-d hkurū llāha qiyāman wa-q uʿūdan wa- ʿalā junūbikum).10 As highlighted by\nRivlin, Q 2:200 similarly charges the addressees to invoke God (fa-d hkurū llāha) “when\nyoup have completed” (idhā qaḍaytum) the pilgrimage rituals. Rivlin therefore suggests\nthat dhikr allāh designates the concluding part of the Medinan prayer ritual, similar to\nthe Jewish Qaddish (Rivlin 1934, 109).11 However, this is on balance not the most likely\nreading. Both Q 4:103, just cited, and also 3:191 enjoin the believers to engage in the\ninvocation of God “standing and sitting and [lying] on yourp/their sides” (qiyāman wa-\nquʿūdan wa- ʿalā junūbikum/junūbihim). The point of cata loguing these dif er ent postures\nmust be to urge the believers to engage in the “invocation of God” in a wide range of daily\nsituations, that is, constantly. Indeed, the formulation may well be an allusive reflection\nof Deut 6:6–7, where the divine voice commands the Israelites to “keep these words that\nI am commanding you today in your heart,” and to “talk about them when you sit in your\nhouse and when you walk on the road, when you lie down and when you rise”; the entire\npassage Deut 6:4–9 became part of the Shәmaʿ Yisraʾēl prayer, uttered as part of the daily\n8 One might consider construing bi-l - ʿashiyyi wa-l -i bkār and bukratan wa-a ṣīlā to be merisms meaning\n“all the time” and point to Q 25:5 in support of this. But in view of the Qur’an’s familiarity with the practice of\nregular diurnal prayer times (→ ṣallā), it seems more likely that this meristic understanding of the phrase is to\nbe limited to Q 25:5.\n9 On recurrent diurnal times of praising God, see also Q 20:130, 40:55, 50:39–40, 52:48–49.\n10 A Meccan verse that could be read as implying a distinction between dhikr and prayer is Q 29:45, which\nfirst enjoins the addressee to perform prayer and then proceeds to say that “God’s dhikr is greater/greatest.” But\nit is quite pos si ble that dhikr allāh here has the sense of exhortation by God, as it does in other Meccan verses\n(e.g., Q 39:22–23).\n11 On Q 2:200, see also under → ab.\ndhakara 311", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

If so, the most likely purport of idhā qaḍaytum l- ṣalāta in\nQ 4:103 is merely “outside the ṣalāh ritual” rather than literally “immediately after per-\nforming the ṣalāh.” This understanding is confirmed by Q 62:10: “when prayer has been\ncompleted” (fa-i dhā quḍiyati l- ṣalātu), the verse addresses its recipients, “then disperse\nin the land and seek God’s favour, and invoke God much (wa-d hkurū llāha kathīran),\nso that you may prosper.” As for Q 2:200’s command to invoke God “when youp have\ncompleted your rites” (idhā qaḍaytum manāsikakum), this too does not cast invocation\nas the concluding ele ment of the pilgrimage rites but rather urges pilgrims to engage in\nadditional devotions after the end of the pilgrimage proper. The most convincing way\nof accounting for the material just examined, then, is to say that at least in the Medinan\nsurahs, invoking God or dhikr allāh functions as a general category that includes, but is\nnot limited to, the regular diurnal prayers. Invocation of God being the purpose of the\nṣalāh ritual, the former concept can stand in for the latter (Q 62:9), but invocation may\nand should also take place outside the ṣalāh (Q 62:10). In fact, Q 4:142 provides a good\nillustration that outward participation in the ṣalāh does not invariably count as achieving\nthe ritual’s under lying objective: when the hypocrites rise to pray (idhā qāmū ilā l- ṣalāti),\nthey do so “lazily, [merely] in order to be seen by the people, and they invoke God only\na little (wa-l ā yadhkurūna llāha illā qalīlā).”\nInvoking God outside the ṣalāh ritual may have consisted in the enunciation of brief\nsituational blessings, prayers, and formulae at dif er ent junctures throughout the day, as\nfamiliar from Jewish and also l ater Islamic practice. It is unfortunately difficult to ascer-\ntain whether the Medinan practice of dhikr involved a range of fixed phrases and what\nthese might have been. A potential glimpse at the issue is aforded by brief paradigmatic\nutterances that some Qur’anic verses attribute to believers or other contemporaries. For\ninstance, Q 18:23–24 instructs the hearers to condition statements of intent, such as\n“I am going to do this tomorrow,” with the proviso “if God w ills” (cf. also 18:39); t hose\nwho forget to add this proviso are told to “invoke yourp Lord” (wa- dhkur rabbaka idhā\nnasīta) by saying, “Perhaps my Lord will guide me to something that is closer than this to\nthe right course of conduct” (wa- qul ʿasā an yahdiyani rabbī li-a qraba min hādhā rashadā).\nIt is admittedly a moot point w hether this verse should be regarded as reflecting a pro-\nnouncement that had acquired, or subsequently came to acquire, significant circulation\n12 That each of the three components of the Qur’anic phrase has a counterpart in Deut 6:7 is illustrated in\nthe table that follows.\nQ 3:191, 4:103 (reordered, numbering indicates\nDeuteronomy 6:7 original order)\nwhen youS sit in your house (ii) sitting (quʿūdan)\nwhen youS walk on the road —\nwhen youS lie down (iii) on yourp/their sides (ʿalā junūbikum/\njunūbihim)\nwhen youS rise (bә- qûmekā, Syriac: mā d- qāʾem att) (i) standing (qiyāman)\n312 dhakara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The verb dhakkara is derived from the root dh- k- r,\nwhose first-f orm verb, dhakara, means “to remember or think of s.th/s.o.” and “to mention or\nspeak of s.th./s.o.” (see CDKA 103–104 and the separate entry on → dhakara). From early\non, dhakara can also denote the invocation of God or God’s name in prayer (e.g., Q 73:8,\n76:25, 87:15; see under → dhakara). Dhakkara in the second verbal stem has the basic\nmeaning “to remind,” in line with the causative significance of many other second-f orm\n13 Note that the utterance fits the prevalent rhyme or verse- final assonance of the surah. This could indicate\nthat the formulation was designed to fit its Qur’anic context, meaning that it may simply form an ad hoc illus-\ntration of the required attitude of contrition. It is also conceivable that the expression was communally a dopted\nonly after the promulgation of Surah 18.\n14 See also some of the material collected in Samji 2018, 54–82.\ndhakkara 313", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Dhakkara can be employed in the mundane sense of jogging someone’s memory\n(Q 2:282); but in the Qur’an it normally figures in a theologically charged capacity, referring\nto the reminders of God’s benevolence, omnipotence, and eschatological reckoning that\nMuhammad or the prophets and messengers preceding him are bidden to address to their\nhearers (e.g., Q 6:70, 14:5, 50:49, 51:55, 52:29, 87:9, 88:21; the latter verse also applies to\nthe Messenger the participle mudhakkir). When used in this manner, dhakkara is seman-\ntically close to verbs like → andhara, “to warn,” and waʿaẓa, “to admonish” (e.g., Q 2:231,\n16:90, 26:136; see Schmid 2021).\nThere are relatively few instances in which dhakkara takes an explicit prepositional\nobject specifying the content of the exhortation at hand, forming the construction “to re-\nmind s.o. of (bi-) s.th.” In most of t hese cases, the prepositional object consists in the plural\nof → āyah, “sign” (see Q 18:57, 25:73, 32:15.22; 10:71 combines bi-ā yāti llāhi with the verbal\nnoun tadhkīr).1 This usage is to be distinguished from an instrumental use of bi-, “to utter\nhortatory reminders by means of (bi-) ,” in which case the prepositional object is e ither al-\nqurʾān, “the Qur’anic recitations” (Q 50:45), or a free-fl oating, antecedent-l ess pronoun\n(“it”) that also refers to the revelations proclaimed by Muhammad (Q 6:70).\nTadhakkara, “to heed God’s hortatory reminders.” The addressees of God- given\nreminders and signs are expected to pay heed to them, an attitude described by the fifth-\nform verb tadhakkara (e.g., Q 2:221.269, 3:7, 38:29, 40:13, 45:23, 69:42, 80:4, 87:10, 89:23).2\nThe Qur’an would seem to operate a general distinction between the passive dhukkira (“to\nbe reminded”), describing a human subject’s exposure to God’s hortatory reminders, and\ntadhakkara, signifying his or her active internalisation of t hese reminders.3 In the refrain\npunctuating much of Surah 54, the stance of paying heed to God’s sign-a cts in history or\nto the divinely revealed “recitation” (al-q urˈān) is described with the active participle\nmuddakir, derived from the eighth- form verb iddakara (e.g., Q 54:15.17.22 etc.).4 The\nfirst- form verb dhakara too is sometimes used as an equivalent of tadhakkara (Q 37:13,\n74:54–56, 80:11–12; see CDKA 103). When dhakara, tadhakkara, or iddakara are employed\nto describe human receptiveness to religious truths, they show partial synonymity with\na range of other verbs such as ʿaqala and faqiha (“to understand”; for ʿaqala, see, e.g.,\nQ 2:44.73.75.76.164.170.171.242, 37:138, 43:3, 45:5; for faqiha, see, e.g., 4:78, 6:25.65.98,\n7:179, 8:65, 9:81.87.127), tadabbara (“to reflect on”; Q 4:82, 23:68, 38:29, 47:24), ihtadā\n(“to be guided”; → hadā), or waʿā, “to consider attentively” (Q 69:12). Like tadhakkara,\nthese verbs often appear in verse-fi nal “so that” (→ laʿalla) clauses (for laʿallakum tadhak-\nkarūn or laʿallahum yatadhakkarūn, see, e.g., Q 2:221, 6:152, 14:25, 28:43.46.51, or 51:49).\nRevelation as recall. The Qur’anic use of dhakkara, tadhakkara, and iddakara manifests\nan understanding of revelation whereby the latter’s function is not to pre sent h umans with\noriginal knowledge not other wise available to them but rather to recall a set of theological\nand moral insights that are taken to be reasonably evident to any careful observer of the\n1 In Q 14:5, the prepositional object is bi- ayyāmi llāhi, “God’s days.”\n2 In the prefix conjugation (muḍāriʿ), the standard text has both yatadhakkaru/-ū n (e.g., Q 2:221, 13:19, 14:25)\nand yadhdhakkaru/-ū n, with assimilation (e.g., Q 2:269, 3:7, 6:126; see CDKA 104).\n3 While tadhakkara is usually intransitive in the Qur’an, one verse, Q 79:35, employs tadhakkara as a tran-\nsitive verb in the ordinary meaning “to remember” (thus CDKA 104 and many translations, including Arberry\n1955). But even here, tadhakkara denotes an act of the mind involving the conscious direction of attention and\nis therefore not equivalent to the passive of dhakkara.\n4 Like tadhakkara, iddakara can also have the non- theological sense “to remember,” as shown by Q 12:45.\n314 dhakkara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Divine exhortation counteracts the human tendency to forget\n(→ nasiya) essential religious truths, a disposition that is explic itly asserted in both Mec-\ncan and Medinan verses; and indeed the roots n- s- y and dh- k- r sometimes figure in clear\nopposition, as in the collocation nasū mā dhukkirū bihi / nasū ḥazzan mimmā dhukkirū\nbihi, “to forget that (or part of that) of which one has been reminded” (Q 5:13.14, 6:44,\nand 7:165; for other verses juxtaposing n- s- y and dh- k- r, see 6:68, 12:42, 18:24.57.63, 23:110,\n25:18, and 58:19). An equally impor tant concomitance obtains between the root dh- k- r and\nthe concept of God’s signs (→ āyāt), which like the notion of divine reminders is pre sent\nfrom the early Meccan surahs onwards (see Q 54:2.15.42, 83:13, 90:19). We saw above that\ndhakkara sometimes takes God’s “signs” as its prepositional object, and other verses too\ncombine dh- k- r with the word āyah in close proximity (e.g., Q 2:221.231, 3:58, 6:126, 7:26,\n16:13, 24:1, 33:34, 38:29, 54:15). Thus, God’s signs, God’s exhortation, and human forget-\nfulness form a triangular conceptual nexus: h umans are confronted with abundant natur al\nand historical indications pointing to an omnipotent divine creator and judge; yet their\npropensity to disregard and neglect these clues necessitates the provision of revelatory\nreminders. The Medinan surahs expand this early Qur’anic understanding of revelation in\nimpor tant ways, by adding the task of providing h umans with specific, quasi-l egal norms\nand stipulations (HCI 202–205). Nonetheless, what one might call the mnemonic dimen-\nsion of the Qur’anic understanding of revelation persists after the hijrah, as demonstrated\nby the fact that dhakkara and tadhakkara continue to figure in Medinan surahs.5\nVerbal nouns associated with dhakkara: tadhkīr, tadhkirah, dhikrā. The verbal\nnouns of dhakkara are tadhkīr, a Qur’anic hapax legomenon (see Q 10:71, where Noah\nmentions his activity of uttering hortatory reminders of God’s signs, tadhkīrī bi-ā yāti llāhi),\nand tadhkirah. The latter is employed as a descriptor of the Qur’anic revelations at a very\nearly stage (e.g., Q 56:73, 69:48, 74:49.54, 80:11) and thus forms one of the first Qur’anic\nself- designations (Sinai 2006, 110–112), appearing around the same time as the term qurʾān,\n“recitation” (e.g., Q 84:21, 85:21; → qaraʾa). But unlike qurʾān, occurrences of tadhkirah\ndo not endure much beyond the end of the early Meccan period, the latest appearances\nof tadhkirah being Q 76:29 and 20:3 (in the latter case paired with qurʾān in v. 2).6 In some\ncases, tadhkirah signifies not the homiletic activity of hortatory reminding but rather\nthe cosmic or historical phenomena to which such reminding draws attention: Q 56:73\ndescribes firewood as a tadhkirah and 69:12 applies the word to Noah’s ark. In both cases,\ntadhkirah appears in contexts where other passages employ → āyah, “sign” (cf. Q 69:12\nwith 29:15). This too indicates that the Qur’anic notions of God’s hortatory reminders and\nof his signs are intimately intertwined.\n5 It is noteworthy that almost all l ater Meccan and Medinan occurrences of dhakkara in a religious sense\n(thus excluding Q 2:282) are in the passive, whereas in the early Meccan period it is the active that is dominant\n(see Q 51:55, 52:29, 87:9, 88:21, and also the marginally later verse 50:45; the earliest appearance of the passive\nmay be the early Meccan verse Q 37:13). The trend t owards a passive use of dhakkara begins already in the l ater\nMeccan surahs; two rare active occurrences are Q 6:70 and 14:5.\n6 One also observes that tadhkirah mostly figures as a predicate (Q 69:48, 73:19, 74:54, 76:29, and 80:11:\n“this/it is reminding exhortation,” inna hādhihi / innahā / innahu tadhkiratun/la-t adhkiratun) or other wise func-\ntions as a qualifier of some other grammatical subject (Q 20:3, 56:73, 69:12); only a single verse has al- tadhkirah\nwith the definite article (Q 74:49), as opposed to almost fifty occurrences of al-q urʾān, starting as early as Q 84:21.\ndhakkara 315", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It may serve as the verbal noun or maṣdar of the first- form verb\ndhakara and mean something like “announcement” (e.g., Q 79:43; CDKA 104); but in\nother cases it would seem to stand in for the maṣdar of dhakkara in the second stem form,\nmaking it an efective synonym of tadhkirah (e.g., Q 87:9: fa- dhakkir in nafaʿati l- dhikrā,\n“So utter reminders, if there is any use to reminding”; see similarly Q 51:55 or 80:4).7\nGiven that what may be the three earliest Qur’anic instances of the word dhikrā occur in\nverse- final position (Q 80:4, 87:9, 89:23), this use of dhikrā in lieu of tadhkirah prob ably\nexemplifies the widespread Qur’anic phenomenon of cognate substitution in the interest\nof maintaining rhyme (see generally Stewart 2009, 20–25). Occurrences of dhikrā in the\nsense of “reminding” or “reminding exhortation” continue until the later Meccan period,\nbeyond the time at which tadhkirah fell into disuse (e.g., Q 6:68.69.90, 7:2; see also the\nlater insertion 74:31). Like tadhkirah, dhikrā is sometimes used synonymously with āyah,\nas one may infer from comparing Q 39:21 and 50:37, which have the phrase inna fī dhālika\nla- dhikrā li-, “in that t here is reminding exhortation for . . . ,” with the much more frequent\nformula inna fī dhālika la- āyatan/āyātin li- , “in that there is a sign / are signs for . . .” (e.g.,\nQ 2:248, 3:49, 10:67, 11:103, 13:3.4, 14:5, 15:75.77, 16:11.12.13.65.67.69.79).

A third noun that is in many verses appropri-\nately rendered as “reminding exhortation” is dhikr. As would be morphologically expected,\ndhikr can simply function as the maṣdar of dhakara and express the act of mentioning or\nspeaking of something or someone, as in Q 12:42 or 18:70.83. In Q 94:4 dhikr refers to the\nMessenger’s standing or reputation, constituted by the way in which he is cumulatively\nspoken of by others. But in many passages, dhikr clearly signifies divine revelation, as in\nstatements about God’s “sending down” (→ nazzala) of dhikr (Q 15:6.9, 16:44, 21:10.50,\n38:8, 65:10; see also 54:25, which has alqā ʿalā, “to cast upon,” instead of nazzala/anzala).\nIn many verses, dhikr could thus be construed as a synonym of tadhkirah, as in Q 36:11:\n“youS only warn t hose who follow the reminding exhortation (al- dhikr).” It is pos sib le that\nwe are h ere confronted with yet another case of cognate substitution; but if so, the latter is\nnot easily explicable by considerations of rhyme, given that only a small proportion of all\noccurrences of dhikr are verse-fi nal (Q 37:3, 38:1, 65:10, 77:5).8 This use of dhikr in the sense\nof “reminder” or “reminding exhortation” commences already in early Meccan verses:\nthe Qur’anic revelations are “a reminder for the world- dwellers” (dhikrun li-l - ʿālamīn),\naccording to Q 68:52 and 81:27 (for latter occurrences of this phrase, see Q 12:104 and\n38:87; 6:90 has dhikrā li- l-ʿ ālamīn).\nIn some verses, al- dhikr with the definite article, literally “the reminder,” comes close\nto operating as a name for the corpus of revelations conveyed by Muhammad. This applies\nin par tic u lar to statements about the “sending down” (nazzala, anzala) of “the reminder”\n(al- dhikr), such as Q 15:6.9 (see also the use of al- dhikr in Q 54:25 or 68:51).

Ps 37:29) as something that God has “written” or “de-\ncreed” (katabnā) “in the → zabūr” (which is almost certainly the same zabūr or “writing”\nthat is associated with David in Q 4:163 and 17:55) “ after the dhikr.” This may mean that\nlike the scripture revealed to Muhammad’s audience (see Q 21:10), the textual corpus\ngranted to David contained dhikr, divine exhortation. Alternatively, Q 21:105 positions the\nrevelatory corpus bestowed upon David as being chronologically later than the Mosaic\nrevelation, which in an earlier verse of the same surah (Q 21:48) is explic itly described as\ndhikr (Goudarzi 2018, 106).\nAt first blush, this use of dhikr in the sense of divine exhortation is largely Meccan\nand has only residual Medinan reverberations (Q 3:58, 65:10). A clear assessment of the\nissue is however complicated by the ambiguity surrounding the occurrence of dhikr\nas the first ele ment of a genitive construction whose second term is God (e.g., dhikr\nallāh in Q 29:45 and 39:22.23, dhikr al-r aḥmān in 43:36, and dhikr rabbihi in 72:17) or in\ncombination with a possessive pronoun referring to God (e.g., dhikrī in Q 38:8.32 and\ndhikrinā in 18:28 and 53:29). In at least some of the relevant verses, the sense would seem\nto be equivalent to the more explicit formulations dhikr min rabbikum/rabbihim (“a dhikr\nfrom yourp/their Lord”; Q 7:63.69 and 21:2) or dhikr min al- raḥmān (“a dhikr from the\nMerciful”; Q 26:5): the preposition min makes it clear that God’s dhikr here is exhortation\ndispensed by (min) God. On the other hand, the verb dhakara is from early on also used\nfor human invocation of God (→ dhakara). Possibly, then, some occurrences of dhikr\nallāh or the like designate human invocation of God (making dhikr allāh an objective\ngenitive) rather than God’s exhortation of humans (making it a subjective genitive; see\nCDKA 104).11 Indeed, a number of Medinan instances of dhikr allāh are contextually likely\nto mean invocation of God (Q 5:91, 24:37, 62:9), by way of a nominalisation of the verbal\nphrase dhakara llāha (e.g., Q 33:41). This buttresses the initial observation made above\n9 The only diference between the two verses is the use of min qablika in Q 16:43 as opposed to qablaka in\n21:7. The opening of the two verses also recurs in Q 12:109.\n10 Note that immediately following the reference to the ahl al- dhikr in Q 16:43, v. 44 affirms that “we have\nsent down reminding exhortation (al- dhikr) to youS so that you might clarify to the p eople what was sent down\nto them.”\n11 Dhikr + possessive suffix can also denote the recipient to whom an act of dhikr is addressed (see Q 12:42,\n21:10, 23:71).\ndhakkara 317", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

To\nbe sure, for Q 13:28 and 39:22–23 t here is a good argument in favour of a subjective read-\ning of dhikr allāh, that is to say, as meaning “God’s reminding exhortation,” and the same\nholds for dhikrī in Q 38:8 and for dhikr al- raḥmān in Q 43:36.12 Yet in other Meccan cases,\nsuch as Q 38:32 (dhikr rabbī), both “reminding exhortation by my Lord” and “invocation\nof my Lord” seem feasible (see also Q 29:45). Moreover, verses like Q 13:28 and 39:22–23,\nwhich describe the responses of believers and unbelievers to dhikr allāh (see also Q 57:16),\ncould be parallelised with similar verses that would seem to employ the temporal clause\nidhā dhukira llāhu instead of dhikr allāh (Q 8:2, 22:35, 39:45). Idhā dhukira llāhu could\nmean “when God is invoked” but also “when God is mentioned” (cf. the use of dhukira\nin Q 47:20). This gives rise to yet another possibility of construing dhikr allāh, namely,\nas mentioning God. But at least the Meccan collocation “to turn away from God’s dhikr”\n(aʿraḍa/tawallā ʿan dhikr + suffix / ʿan dhikr rabbihi / ʿan dhikri rabbihim . . . ; Q 20:124,\n21:42, 53:29, 72:17; see also 23:71 and 26:5) should prob ably be understood to mean disre-\ngard of God’s revelatory reminders rather than as insufficient invocation of God in prayer or\ninsufficient mentioning of him: aʿraḍa ʿan also combines with the noun tadhkirah (Q 74:49)\nand with God’s signs or āyāt (Q 18:57, 32:22), and one occurrence of aʿraḍa ʿan + dh- k- r has\nthe unequivocal dhikr min al- raḥmān, “a dhikr from the Merciful” (Q 26:5). Although the\nmatter could plainly do with a more detailed analy sis, it may be provisionally suggested\nthat the progression from Meccan to Medinan texts coincides with a tendency (though\nnot one devoid of exceptions) to shift from the hortatory sense of dhikr allāh and similar\nphrases to an invocatory one.\nDespite the necessity of attempting to pinpoint as far as pos si ble whether a given in-\nstance of dhikr is more appropriately translated as “reminding exhortation” provided by\nGod or as “invocation” of God, it is impor tant to appreciate that the word dhikr is not\nsimply a homonym expressing dif er ent meanings that are entirely unrelated. At least\nwhen Qur’anic verses containing the noun dhikr and other derivatives of dh- k- r are heard\nand read synchronically, as they prob ably began to be already during the lifetime of Mu-\nhammad, the text evokes the sense that there is a cycle of dhikr connecting God and\nhumankind: God “sends down” dhikr- as- exhortation to humans, and humans who let\nthemselves be reminded and exhorted by God will practice dhikr-a s-i nvocation—a nd\nalso, presumably, dhikr- as- mentioning, in the sense that they will speak and preach of\nGod. The fact that, shorn of context, dhikr allāh can have any one of these three senses\nis therefore not without potential significance, and it should not be ruled out that there\nmight be Qur’anic statements for which it is ultimately more fitting to let the ambiguity\nstand than to seek to resolve it.\n12 Q 39:23 speaks of divine revelation before describing the appropriate response of human “hearts” (qulūb)\nto dhikr allāh; this creates a contextual likelihood that the term dhikr allāh in vv. 22 and 23 is to be understood\nas dhikr provided by God. Q 13:28 too focuses on the response of human hearts to God’s dhikr, and due to its\nthematic resemblance to 39:22–23 is best understood along the same lines. As regards Q 38:8, “my dhikr” is pre-\nceded by the statement unzila ʿalayhi l- dhikru (“the dhikr was sent down upon him”), making it clear that dhikr\nhere refers to divine revelation rather than human invocation.\n318 dhakkara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Rather, the following discussion is l imited to the use of demonstratives in surah\nopenings, such as Q 2:2. Its main conclusions accord with and build on Birnstiel’s insight\nthat dhālika/tilka deixis usually serves an anaphoric function in the Qur’an: dhālika “refers\nin most cases to the propositional content of the preceding discourse or to an actant or\nobject characterized therein” (Birnstiel 2010, 191).\nThe use of dhālika/tilka deixis at the beginning of Q 2 and other surahs. Surah 2\nopens with three isolated Arabic letters, “Alif, Lām, Mīm” (→ ʾ- l- m; v. 1), and then con-\ntinues, in v. 2: “That is the scripture (dhālika l- kitābu) about which there is no doubt,\nguidance for the God- fearing.”1 Early Muslim exegetical authorities are credited with the\nview that dhālika l- kitābu is equivalent with hādhā l-k itābu, “This is the scripture” or “this\nscripture” (Ṭab. 1:228–229). This is in fact a rather natur al construal of Q 2:2 that interprets\nit as a sort of superscript for the remainder of the Qur’an. However, according to traditional\npre sen ta tions of Arabic grammar dhālika (masculine) and tilka (feminine), convention-\nally characterised as “far” or “distal” demonstratives, refer to something that is located\nat a spatial or temporal distance from the speaker, in contrast with hādhā and hādhihī,\n“this.” The wording dhālika l- kitābu therefore occasioned debate (e.g., Ṭab. 1:229–230;\nZam. 1:141): if the meaning of Q 2:2 is that this—to wit, the following—is “the scripture,”\nwhy does the verse not run hādhā l-k itābu rather than dhālika l-k itābu? To be sure, t here\nis no a priori reason to suppose that the standard distinction between near and far de-\nmonstratives is necessarily applicable to Qur’anic Arabic (Birnstiel 2010, 124–127). Still,\nmany self- referential Qur’anic statements employ hādhā, including sixteen occurrences\nof “this qurʾān” (hādhā l- qurʾān, e.g., Q 6:19, 10:37, 12:3, 17:9.41.88.89, 18:54, 25:30, 27:76,\n59:21; → qaraʾa), three instances of “this (hādhā) is a scripture that . . .” (Q 6:92.155 and\n46:12),2 over a dozen cases where the Qur’an’s opponents are quoted as saying, “This is\nnothing but . . .” (in hādhā illā . . . ; e.g., Q 5:110, 6:25, 25:4, 74:24–25), and a significant\nnumber of further cases in which “this” (hādhā, hādhihī) is combined with terms like\n1 The phrase dhālika l-k itābu can be parsed as a complete nominal sentence (“That is the scripture”) or as\nforming only a grammatical subject whose predicate consists in the ensuing phrase lā rayba fīhi (Zam. 1:143). This\nlatter construal would yield the translation “That scripture, t here is no doubt in/about it.” However, in view of\nthe parallel tilka āyātu l- kitābi (Q 10:1, 12:1, 13:1, 15:1, 26:2, 28:2, and 31:2), “ Those are the signs of the scripture,”\nthe first alternative is clearly preferable (KK 13). Lā rayba fīhi is then best viewed as forming an asyndetic relative\nclause dependent on al- kitāb (“in/about which t here is no doubt”; see also u nder → irtāba). Given the definiteness\nof the antecedent, one might of course have expected a relative pronoun, but there are further instances in the\nQur’an where lā rayba fīhi has a definite antecedent yet lacks a preceding pronoun. On asyndetic clauses with\ndefinite antecedents more generally, see Jones 2005, 146, and n. 34 under → ashraka.\n2 Q 45:29, which is superficially similar, refers to the divine rec ord book displayed at the last judgement.\ndhālika, tilka 319", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It remains apt, therefore, to won der why Q 2:2— and\nalso the parallel formulation tilka āyātu l-k itābi in Q 10:1, 12:1 etc.—do not conform to\nthis usage. What, if anything, is conveyed by dhālika/tilka here that would not have been\nconveyed by hādhā/hādhihī?\nSurah-i nitial dhālika/tilka deixis as a case of anaphora. Both al- Ṭabarī and al-\nZamakhsharī suggest that Q 2:2 employs dhālika in order to refer back to something pre-\nceding, such as the letter sequence immediately before (Ṭab. 1:229–230; Zam. 1:141). Loth\nassumes a similar backwards-l ooking construal for the phrase tilka āyātu l-k itābi (Loth\n1881, 603–604). Schwally takes Loth to imply that āyāt must therefore mean “letters” in\nQ 2:2 and similar surah introductions, and he objects that the word āyah does not have this\nsense anywhere else in the Qur’an (GQ 2:74–75). Yet while this is a valid objection as far\nas the Qur’anic meaning of āyah goes, there are nonetheless good grounds for supposing\nthat the demonstratives in both dhālika l- kitābu and tilka āyātu l-k itābi do indeed look\nbackwards rather than forwards.\nFor one, neither formulation ever occurs without a preceding letter sequence, unlike\nother superscripts such as “A sending- down of the scripture” (tanzīlu l- kitābi; → nazzala),\nwhich is found in Q 39:1 without a foregoing letter string, or “A surah that we have sent down\nand decreed, and in which we have sent down clear signs” (sūratun anzalnāhā wa- faraḍnāhā\nwa- anzalnā fīhā āyātin bayyinātin) at the beginning of Surah 24. This raises the possibility\nthat the referent of the demonstratives dhālika and tilka is indeed the respective antecedent\nletter sequence. Secondly, and more importantly, an overview of other Qur’anic passages\nestablishes that dhālika and tilka are regularly employed anaphorically, i.e., to refer back\nto a preceding statement or passage or to something mentioned therein (see in more detail\nBirnstiel 2010, 190–224). For instance, when Q 45:6 says that “t hose are the signs of God\nthat we recite to youS in truth” (tilka āyātu llāhi natlūhā ʿalayka bi- l-ḥ aqqi), this comments\non the natur al signs rehearsed in vv. 4–5 (which are preceded by the announcement that\n“in the heavens and on earth t here are signs for the believers” in v. 3). A similarly backward-\nlooking usage of the formula tilka āyātu llāhi natlūhā ʿalayka bi- l-ḥ aqqi may be perceived\nin Q 2:252 and 3:108, even if Schwally doubtfully takes the phrase to refer to what follows\nhere (GQ 2:75, n. 1).3 Six verses use the formula tilka ḥudūdu llāhi, “t hose are God’s bound-\naries,” with re spect to a preceding l egal prescription (Q 2:187.229.230, 4:13, 58:4, and 65:1).4\nA functionally similar employment of tilka in conjunction with anbāʾ al- ghayb, “tidings of\nthe hidden,” is found in Q 11:49 (“ Those belong to the tidings of the hidden that we reveal to\nyou”), pointing to the foregoing narrative about Noah (vv. 25–48; see also u nder → ˻asāṭīr\nal- awwalīn); and Q 29:43 says that “t hose are the similitudes that we relate for h umans,”\nwith reference to the preceding comparison of taking patrons besides God with the frailty\n3 Schwally may be considering Q 3:108 to preface v. 109: “And to God belongs what is in the heavens and\nthe earth . . .” (wa-l i-l lāhi mā fī l-s amāwāti wa-m ā fī l-a rḍi . . .). However, it is more likely that vv. 108–109 close\nout and retrospectively categorise vv. 100–107 (note especially the ocurrence of talā, “to recite,” + āyāt in v. 101\nas in v. 108). As regards Q 2:252, the verse clearly functions as a closer of the preceding account of the Israelite’s\ndefeat of “Goliath and his hosts.”\n4 On ḥudūd, see CDKA 67–68.\n320 dhālika, tilka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Such enigmatic\nletter sequences may in turn be understood to represent the Qur’anic proclamations’ celes-\ntial archetype, as argued in more detail elsewhere (→ ʾ- l- m). What Q 2:2 says, consequently,\nis that the preceding letter sequence (dhālika) stands for the transcendent scripture (al-\nkitāb) that is not empirically accessible to h umans and therefore admits, at most, of a kind\nof surrogate display by means of isolated letter symbols. An analogous construal can be\nextended to the phrase tilka āyātu l- kitābi (“ Those are the signs of the scripture”) in Q 10:1,\n12:1 e tc. These passages additional involve the term → āyah, whose basic meaning is a “sign”\nof God’s existence and power. Verses like Q 2:106 or 3:113 establish that the word āyah can\nalso designate a passage of divinely revealed text, presumably because such revelations\naccord a fundamental importance to manifestations of God in nature and history. When\nused in this textual sense, the plural āyāt is best rendered as “sign-p ronouncements.” If we\nplace the surah- opening phrase tilka āyātu l- kitābi against this background, it refers back to\nthe preceding letter sequence and identifies it as representing the “sign- pronouncements”\ncontained in the celestial scriptural archetype. The purport of a statement like tilka āyātu\nl- kitābi l- mubīn, “ Those are the sign-p ronouncements of the clear scripture,” would accord-\ningly be roughly equivalent to “That is the clear scripture with its sign-p ronouncements.”\nFi nally, there is the complex expression tilka āyātu l-k itābi wa-q urʾānin mubīn, “ Those\nare the sign- pronouncements of the scripture and of a clear recitation” in Q 15:1 and, in\na dif er ent permutation, in 27:1 (tilka āyātu l-q urʾāni wa-k itābin mubīn). Q 15:1 and 27:1\nexpress the notion that the Qur’anic recitations and their celestial source are in some\nsense identical (Sinai 2006, 124), just as we might think of a novel and its film or theatre\nadaptation as instantiations of one and the same artistic work. Accordingly, Q 15:1 and 27:1\nmay be paraphrased along the lines of “That is the scripture with its sign- pronouncements,\nmade accessible through a corpus of clear recitations.”\nAn alternative interpretation: dhālika/tilka deixis in surah superscripts as referring\nto what follows.

The verb dhāqa + acc., “to taste s.th.,” is used literally in the story of Adam\nand Eve (Q 7:22), but other wise has the meta phorical significance of having direct expe-\nrience of something. The most frequent object of experiential tasting is God’s “torment”\nor “punishment,” ʿadhāb (→ ʿadhdhaba; e.g., Q 3:106.181, 4:56, 6:30, 22:9.22.25, 34:12.42,\n38:8, 41:16.27.50, 46:34). This usually means God’s punishment in the hereafter, although\nQ 39:26 and 41:16 illustrate that the things God can “cause s.o. to taste” (adhāqa) also in-\nclude “humiliation (al- khizy; → ʿadhdhaba) in the proximate life” (see also Q 16:112, 17:75,\n32:21, referenced in Durie 2018, 51–52).1 This widespread Qur’anic meta phor of tasting\ndivine punishment is already found in early Meccan texts (Q 37:31.38, 54:37.39.48). As\nDurie has noted (Durie 2018, 48), the rhetorical stress would seem to be on being sub-\njected to a direct experience of something that an individual has previously denied, as\nevident from Q 32:20 and 34:42 (“Taste the punishment of fire that you used to dismiss\nas a lie!,” dhūqū ʿadhāba l-n āri lladhī/llatī kuntum bihi/bihā tukadhdhibūn)” or from\nQ 3:106, 6:30, 8:35 and 46:34 (“Taste the punishment for having repudiated, bi-m ā kuntum\n1 Employment of the fourth-f orm verb adhāqa is peculiar to l ater Meccan surahs (e.g., Q 6:65, 11:9.10, 16:112,\n17:75, 25:19, 32:21; see Durie 2018, 51–52, 67–68, and 97).

The Qur’anic employment of the meta phor of tasting is distinctive in its\npervasiveness though not without pre ce dent. When a number of Qur’anic verses predict\nthat “every one will taste death” (Q 3:185, 21:35, 29:57; see also 44:56), this makes use of a\nNew Testamental idiom (Rudolph 1922, 14; CQ 43; BEQ 451; El- Badawi 2014, 168–170).\nFor instance, according to John 8:52 the Jews say to Jesus: “Now we know that you have\na demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets; yet you say, ‘Whoever keeps my word\nwill never taste (mē geusētai, Peshitta: lā neṭʿam) death.’ ” The same formulation is also\nfound in Matt 16:28, Mark 9:1, Luke 9:27, and Heb 2:9. Nonetheless, the Biblical ring of\nQur’anic dhāqa should prob ably not be exaggerated and the meta phor may well have\nbeen standard in pre- Qur’anic Arabic. The verb ḏwq in the sense of “to experience” seems\nto occur in a Safaitic inscription reporting an outbreak of smallpox,3 and a verse in the\nMuʿallaqah of Zuhayr speaks of “tasting” war, with dhāqa employed in combination— i.e.,\nas a pleonastic synonym of— ʿalima (DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 16:28).4 Specifically the notion\nof tasting death (dhāqa l-m awta) occurs in a poem found in the dīwān of al- Nābighah\n(DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 27:28, pointed out in CQ 43 and BEQ 451).5 A poetic fragment\nattributed to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt describes the serpent as having “tasted” (dhāqat) the\nseriousness of God’s punishment, presumably for having seduced Adam (Schulthess 1911a,\nno. 28:7 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 69:7). Given that the preceding verse refers to God’s chastise-\nment of the snake by employing the verb ʿadhdhaba, the Umayyah fragment recalls the\nfrequent Qur’anic collocation of dhāqa and ʿadhāb that was noted above. Nonetheless, the\nUmayyah passage has generally been felt to have a good claim to authenticity (Seidensticker\n2011b, 49–50), so the parallel is significant.\n2 See also Q 8:14, 10:70, 41:27.50, 64:5.\n3 See SIJ 730 at krc .o rient .o x .a c .u k /o ciana /c orpus /p ages /O CIANA _0 017439 .h tml (accessed 10 Decem-\nber 2021). I am grateful to Ahmad Al- Jallad for pointing me to this inscription.\n4 Although the two immediately preceding verses of the poem are prob ably a post- Qur’anic accretion (Sinai\n2019b, 20–22), the tasting verse appears unsuspicious.\n5 The poem is however not included in al-A ṣmaʿī’s version of the dīwān.

Expressions\ninvolving the noun rabb, “lord,” are one of the Qur’an’s three primary ways of designating\nthe deity, the other two being the divine names → allāh (“God”) and → al- raḥmān (“the\nMerciful”). What one might call a secular use of rabb for a human master is rare in the\nQur’an though not entirely absent (Q 12:41.42.50, prob ably also 12:23). To call God a rabb\nis to mark him out as the only being meriting human ser vice and worship (verb: ʿabada;\nsee Q 2:21, 3:51, 5:72.117, 6:102, 10:3, 15:99, 17:23, 19:36.65, 21:92, 22:77, 27:91, 43:64, 106:3).1\nThe divine title rabb is thus the complement of ʿabd. In an interhuman context, the latter\nword can mean “slave” (Q 2:178.221, 16:75, 24:32),2 but when describing the relationship\nbetween humans and God it is best rendered “servant”: this translational choice is both\nin line with established En glish usage, since Hebrew ʿebed hā- ӗlōhîm / ʿebed YHWH and\nGreek doulos theou are commonly rendered “servant of God / the Lord” rather than “slave\nof God,” and reveals what an ʿabd of God is expected to do, namely: to “serve” (ʿabada)\n1 On ʿabada, “to serve, to worship,” see JPND 213–214 and CQ 20.

Ambros 2001, 11–12).\nIt is useful to observe that the word ʿabd, when applied to the relationship between\nhumans and God, figures in a dual capacity in the Qur’an, a universal one and a more\nexclusive one (Mir 1987, 3; see also u nder → al-r aḥmān; cf. Chittick 1989, 310–312). In\none sense all h umans are “servants” of God, in so far as they have been created by him,\nreceive manifold divine blessings from him, are unconditionally subject to God’s power,\nand therefore o ught to serve him (e.g., Q 17:5, 19:93, 34:13, 39:46, 41:46, 42:27).4 Servants\nof God in the proper sense, however, are only t hose humans who actually do serve God,\nwho do so exclusively, and who will accordingly receive eschatological reward (e.g.,\nQ 17:65, 43:68, 76:6, 89:29).\nGod’s lordship in Q 7:172–173. As just pointed out, all humans are God’s servants\nbecause they ought to serve him; and all humans are considered capable of realising this\nbasic truth. This becomes particularly clear in Q 7:172–173, which famously posit that\nGod extracted the “ofspring” (dhurriyah) of the “ children of Adam” from their “backs”\nor loins (wa-i dh akhadha rabbuka min banī ādama min ẓuhūrihim dhurriyyatahum),5 ap-\nparently before the descendants in question w ere conceived, and to have “made them\ntestify” (ashhadahum) that he is their Lord (rabb). The rationale given for this divine act is\nto preclude humans, on the day of the resurrection, from defending their failure to live up\nto the requirements of Qur’anic mono the ism by claiming to be the ofspring (dhurriyyah)\nof polytheistic ancestors and therefore to have been “heedless” of their divine Lord (an\ntaqūlū yawma l-q iyāmati innā kunnā ʿan hādhā ghāfilīn).6 The upshot is that all h umans\nare deemed to have undertaken a prenatal personal commitment to God’s lordship, quite\nirrespective of the rituals and beliefs to which their biographical descent has factually and\ncontingently exposed them.7 Read in context, the universal reach of the covenantal scene\nfrom Q 7:172–173 contrasts with the preceding verse, 7:171, describing how God threat-\nened the Israelites by shaking Mount Sinai above their heads and urged them to “hold\n3 Parenthetically, while the Qur’an insists on exclusive worship of the Lord, a religious use of ʿabd is not of\ncourse confined to a mono thei stic context; thus, the author of a Safaitic inscription identifies himself as a servant\n(ʿbd) of Allāt (Mu 550 in Al- Jallad 2015a, 275).\n4 As Mir remarks, in Q 17:5 the word ʿabd is “used as a value-f ree term”: God’s “servants”—an allusive ref-\nerence to the Babylonians conquering Jerusalem—a re called thus “not b ecause they w ere particularly right eous,\nbut simply because they served as an instrument for executing a certain divine scheme” (Mir 1987, 3).\n5 Note the recurrence of references to the “ children of Adam” in Q 7:26.27.31.35.172. Surah 7 is in fact the\nonly surah containing a series of banū ādam references.\n6 On the Islamic reception history of this passage, see Gramlich 1983; for a historical- critical analy sis, see\nHartwig 2008. Hartwig makes the compelling proposal that the entire verse group Q 7:171–174 might be a Me-\ndinan insertion (Hartwig 2008, 192–193). Although he does not elaborate on his rationale, it should be noted\nthat the parallels to the raising of the mountain over the Israelites in Q 7:171 (namely, Q 2:63.93 and 4:154) are\nalso Medinan.\n7 The scene described in Q 7:172–173 is often described as a “primordial” or “pretemporal” (thus SQ 467)\ncovenant between God and humans. This reflects a later ḥadīth that transfers the scene into a “state of pre-\nexistence” in which God extracts all of f uture humanity from the loins of Adam immediately a fter the latter’s\ncreation (Gramlich 1983, 205–207). Yet as some Islamic exegetes duly point out, the wording of Q 7:172 speaks of\nthe loins of the “ children of Adam” rather than of Adam (Gramlich 1983, 209). The scene accordingly seems to\npresuppose not only the creation of Adam but also the existence of a collective entity that can be referred to as the\n“ children of Adam.” If so, the scene w ill have to be set, at the earliest, in the generation of Adam’s “two sons” (Q 5:27).\nrabb 325", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

While the divine name al- raḥmān only emerges at a secondary\nstage of the Meccan Qur’an, rabb is frequent already in the early Meccan surahs. It is very\noften combined with a possessive suffix, as in “yourS Lord” (rabbuka; Q 84:6, 85:12, 87:1,\n89:6.13.14, 93:3.5.11, 94:8, 96:1.3.8, 99:5, 108:2; for other early Meccan instances of rabb + pos-\nsessive suffix, see, e.g., Q 83:15, 84:2.5.15, 87:15, 89:15, 91:14, 92:20, 100:6.11). God’s role as the\npatron deity of the Meccan sanctuary is reflected in the title “Lord of this h ouse,” rabb hādhā\nl- bayt (Q 106:3; → bayt). It is worth underlining that the prominence of rabb + suffix in the\nearly Meccan corpus does not mean that the divine name allāh is unattested in this layer of\nthe Islamic scripture (e.g., Q 82:19, 84:23, 85:20, 87:7, 88:24, 91:13, 96:14, 104:6). Some early\nMeccan surahs in fact alternate between rabb + possessive suffix and allāh.9 They should con-\nsequently be taken to refer to the same divine being. Overall, the early Meccan data warrant\nthe assumption that the early Qur’an’s dual nomenclature for God was well established in\nthe Qur’anic milieu prior to the beginning of Muhammad’s activity, which is further borne\nout by poetic evidence (see below). Rabb + suffix remains common in the Medinan period\n(e.g., Q 2:5.21.26.30.37.46.49.61.62.68 e tc., 3:7.8.9.15.16.35 e tc.).\nGod as rabb in pre- Qur’anic Arabic. It has been suggested that the Arabic word rabb\nwas borrowed from Aramaic (FVQ 136–137), but as in many similar cases such a transfer\nwould need to have occurred before the Qur’an. Early Arabic poetry indicates that the term\nrabb had become part and parcel of conventional religious language. For instance, a poem\nabout the creation of the world by ʿAdī ibn Zayd of al-Ḥ īrah refers alternatively to “the\ngod of creation” (ilāh al- khalq; al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 103:2), Adam’s “Lord” (al-M uʿaybid\n1965, no. 103:10), and allāh (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 103:14; see also Dmitriev 2010, 353,\n360, 366, 373); and a synonymous employment of rabb + suffix and allāh is also found in a\npoem from the corpus of Zuhayr (DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 20:11–12; see Sinai 2019b, 34–35).\nAnother verse attributed to ʿAdī ibn Zayd famously swears by “the Lord of Mecca and of\nthe cross” (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 3:10; see Sinai 2019b, 52). ʿAntarah invokes “the Lord\nof the house” (rabb al- bayt; DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 21:10; see Sinai 2019b, 53), resembling\nQ 106:3, where God is referred to as “the Lord of this h ouse” (rabb hādhā l-b ayt).10 Th ese\npoetic attestations receive additional credibility from a Palaeo- Arabic inscription north of\nal- Ṭāʾif that has recently been reinterpreted as containing the invocation “May our Lord\nbless you” (brk-[ k]m rb- nʾ; Al- Jallad and Sidky 2021) and from another Palaeo- Arabic in-\nscription, also from the Ḥijāz, that combines allāh and rabb (Al- Jallad and Sidky 2021, 9).\n8 See also Q 30:30, positing an innate “creaturely disposition” (fiṭrah) t owards monot hei sm (see\nunder → ḥanīf). The Qur’anic assumption that all of humankind may validly be judged with the yardstick of\nmono the ism is of course also grounded in the Qur’anic claim that every human community (→ ummah) has\nbeen sent a divinely authorised messenger dispensing mono the istic instruction (→ rasūl), as Q 10:47 and other\nverses maintain.\n9 According to Welch, the “absence of the name Allah is striking in passages that date from the beginning\nof Muhammad’s public ministry” (Welch 1979, 734). Yet this is doubtful. Especially Surah 104, which mentions\nnār allāh, “God’s fire,” in v. 6, may well belong to the very earliest group of Qur’anic proclamations.\n10 For other occurrences of rabb with possessive suffix or in a genitive construction in believably pre-I slamic\npoetry, see Sinai 2019b, 27, 31 (n. 144), 32, 33, 49, 51, 53.\n326 rabb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

At least when the word rabb is used by a Christian like ʿAdī ibn\nZayd, it would seem to echo Biblical references to “the Lord” (Hebrew: ӑdōnāy, Greek:\nkyrios, Syriac: māryā; see TDOT 1:59–72; NIDOTTE 1:275; TDNT 3:1039–1098; cf.

But rabb as a divine title was clearly in use beyond self- confessedly\nJewish or Christian communities.\nRabb al-ʿ ālamīn, “Lord of the world- dwellers,” and other genitive constructions.\nApart from combining with possessive suffixes, rabb can also occur in genitive construc-\ntions. As we saw above, an early Meccan surah speaks of “the Lord of this h ouse” (Q 106:3)\nand a l ater Meccan verse has “the Lord of this settlement” (Q 27:91). But God is not only\nthe master of a specific locale, his sovereignty has a universal cosmic extent: he is “the Lord\nof the throne” (Q 9:129, 21:22, 23:86.116, 27:26, 43:82; on the divine throne, see generally\nO’Shaughnessy 1973), “the Lord of the east and the west ±​<and what is between them>”\n(Q 26:28, 73:9: rabb al- mashriq wa- l- maghrib ±​<wa- mā baynahumā>; cf. 37:5, 55:17, and\n70:40), and the “Lord of the heavens and the earth” (rabb al-s amāwāt wa-l -a rḍ; e.g.,\nQ 13:16, 17:102, 18:14; see in more detail u nder → arḍ). Perhaps most importantly, God is\ncalled rabb al- ʿālamīn, a staple of Qur’anic terminology from the early Meccan period\n(Q 26:16.23.47.77.98.109.127.145.164.180.192, 37:87.182, 56:80, 69:43, and 83:6) u ntil the\nMedinan one (Q 2:131, 5:28), with par tic u lar frequency in the later Meccan surahs (e.g.,\nQ 6:45.71.162, 7:54.61.67.104.121, 10:10.37, 27:8.44, 45:36). As shown elsewhere (→ al-\nʿālamūn), the appropriate rendering of al-ʿ ālamīn in the Qur’an is undoubtedly “inhabitants\nof the entire world” or “world- dwellers” rather than “worlds.” In fact, the Qur’an nowhere\nmakes use of the singular ʿālam to mean the world or cosmos in its entirety, for which the\nIslamic scripture normally employs the merism “the heavens and the earth ±​<and what\nis between them>.” Hence, irrespective of the pre- Qur’anic evidence to be reviewed in\nthe next section, Qur’anic usage leaves one no choice but to translate rabb al- ʿālamīn as\n“Lord of the world- dwellers”: the point of the title is to assert divine lordship over persons\nrather than over the cosmos (for which latter notion the Qur’an deploys other epithets).\nIt is pos si ble that the peculiar Qur’anic use of the phrase rabb al- ʿālamīn to signify\n“Lord of the world- dwellers” rather than “Lord of the worlds” was facilitated by the fact\nthat ʿālmā, “world,” can also mean “every one” in Jewish Aramaic (DJBA 867), a similar\nusage being found in Syriac (TS 2899–2900: ʿālmā d- bnay nāshā = “a multitude of p eople”;\nkolleh ʿālmā = “every one”; see also SL 1105). To be sure, even this conjecture would lead\none to expect rabb al- ʿālam, with the second ele ment of the construct in the singular. But\nit is striking that with one exception (Q 25:1) all of the Qur’an’s seventy- odd occurrences\nof al- ʿālamīn, whether or not preceded by rabb, occur in verse- final position (which is\nalso the case for the verse by Labīd cited under → al-ʿ ālamūn). This suggests that at least\npart of the reason for the Qur’an’s preference of rabb al-ʿ ālamīn over a hy po thet i cal rabb\nal-ʿ ālam is a concern with rhyme, which has been shown to be a factor in Qur’anic diction\nand word order elsewhere too (Stewart 2009).\nPrecursors for the divine epithet rabb al- ʿālamīn. The expression rabb al- ʿālamīn is\nreminiscent of Jewish and Christian titles for God, which Nöldeke and Schwally document\nin some detail (GQ 1:112, n. 1; see also BEḲ 37), though in confronting this material it is im-\nperative to bear in mind that the Qur’anic employment of rabb al- ʿālamīn revolves around\ndivine lordship over persons rather than over the cosmos.

Moreover, Q 34:5 and 45:11 threaten those who strive against God’s\nsigns or who repudiate them with “a punishment of painful rijz” (lahum ʿadhābun min rijzin\nalīm), which also indicates a close semantic link between the words rijz and ʿadhāb. Of\ncourse, the two words’ interchangeability in verses like Q 7:135 and 43:50 does not entail\ntheir full synonymity. But minimally, virtually all Qur’anic occurrences of the noun rijz (with\nthe exception of Q 8:11, discussed below) are contextually compatible with a conjectured\nsignification “punishment.” Thus, when God sends or sends down upon the wrongdoers\nrijz “from the sky” or “from heaven” (Q 2:59, 7:162: anzalnā/arsalnā ʿalā . . . r ijzan mina\nl-s amāʾi; similarly 29:34), the word is comfortably translatable as “punishment.”\nIt is however notable that the noun ʿadhāb is never qualified by the addition mina l-s amāʾi\nnor does it ever figure as the accusative object of the verbs → anzala, “to send down,” or\narsala, “to send,” unlike rijz. Such minor diferences in the phraseological behaviour of\nʿadhāb and rijz suggest that the former is best understood as a general term encompassing\na broad variety of dif ere nt types of divine punishment, not all of which befall their victims\nfrom above, as would seem to be the case with rijz punishments. This is substantiated, for\ninstance, by Q 16:45, where being swallowed up by the earth appears to be singled out as\na par tic u lar kind of ʿadhāb, as well as the many verses in which the torments of hell are\ntermed an ʿadhāb, as is the case, e.g., in phrases like “the punishment of the fire” (ʿadhāb\nal- nār; e.g., Q 2:126.201) or “the punishment of burning” (ʿadhāb al-ḥ arīq; e.g., Q 3:181,\n8:50). Rijz, by contrast, would seem to signify a par tic ul ar type of punishment that descends\nvertically. This distinction is also reflected, albeit without use of the word rijz, in Q 8:32,\nwhere the repudiators are quoted as challenging God to e ither let stones “rain down” upon\nthem “from the sky” (fa- amṭir ʿalaynā ḥijāratan mina l-s amāʾi), corresponding to a rijz- type\npunishment, or to strike them down with a “painful punishment” (awi ʾtinā bi- ʿadhābin\nalīm), that is to say, with some other kind of punishment.1 This attempt at specifying the\n1 I owe my awareness of the pertinence of Q 8:32 to Saqib Hussain.\nrijz/rujz 329", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Perhaps the basic significance of rijz is\nindeed “commotion, agitation, convulsion,” as posited by other lexicographers (AEL 1036);\nbut given that the Qur’anic corpus does not, for instance, employ any verbal derivatives of\nthe same root, it is difficult to be sure. As we s hall see below, it is in any case highly likely\nthat the Qur’anic semantics of rijz was also afected by a Syriac cognate meaning “wrath.”\nRijz, rijs, and rujz. The semantics of rijz are further complicated by the fact that the\nQur’an’s canonical rasm shows some evidence of conflation between rijz and the similar-\nsounding noun rijs. It is obvious that the latter term properly signifies “filth, impurity,\nabomination.” Rijs is used to formulate the categorical prohibition of a l imited range of\nsubstances (such as wine and pork) as well as of certain activities and objects that seem to\nbe linked to pagan ritual (namely, the game of maysir, sacrificial stones, divining arrows,\nidols; see Q 5:90, 6:145, 22:30), and the word can also be used meta phor ically to vituperate\nthose unwilling to participate in the Prophet’s military campaigns or those whose hearts\nare said to be diseased (Q 9:95.125).2 However, when Q 7:71 has the messenger Hūd de-\nclare to the p eople of ʿĀd that “rijs and wrath (ghaḍab; → ghaḍiba) have come upon youp\n(waqaʿa ʿalaykum) from your Lord,” it is virtually certain that rijs is h ere being used in the\nmeaning normally associated with rijz, “punishment” (see KK 163 as well as Abū ʿUbaydah\n1955–1962, 1:218, and Jal. 572, equating rijs with ʿadhāb).3 The understanding that rijs is\nbeing used in the sense of rijz is also plausible for Q 6:125 and 10:100, though it is striking\nthat the phrase jaʿala l-r ijsa ʿalā (“to impose punishment on s.o.”?) is peculiar to these\ntwo verses and that rijz in the sense of punishment never figures as a direct object of\njaʿala. The opposite situation obtains at Q 8:11, where rijz is employed in the sense of rijs,\n“filth” (wa- yudhhiba ʿankum rijza l- shayṭāni, “and to remove the filth of Satan from you”;\ncf. Q 33:33, where adhhaba ʿankum takes as its direct object al- rijs; see also KK 184).\nAt least for Q 8:11, the Islamic tradition also documents the non- canonical textual\nvariant rijs instead of rijz (MQ 3:270–271; MQQ 2:441). Hence, it is conceivable that both\nin Q 7:71 and 8:11 the transmission history of the Qur’an’s canonical rasm sufered from\nminor errors caused by inaccurate transcription from oral dictation, a phenomenon for\nwhich the lower layer of the Sanaa Palimpsest provides additional evidence (Sadeghi\nand Bergmann 2010, 384–390; Sinai 2020b, 197).4 The alternative scenario would be to\n2 Cf. also Q 9:28, reviling the associators as “filth” (najas).\n3 In support of this, cf. Q 7:71 with 7:134, where the same verb waqaʿa ʿalā is used with rijz, “punishment,”\nas the grammatical subject. I owe this observation to Zellentin 2022, 297, n. 26, though Zellentin himself does\nnot think that rijs in Q 7:71 should be equated with rijz and proposes to gloss the meaning of the word as a\n“propensity to sin.”\n4 Unfortunately, the lower layer of the Sanaa Palimpsest, as edited by Sadeghi and Goudarzi, does not\ncontain either Q 7:71 or 8:11 (see the overview in Sadeghi and Goudarzi 2012, 37–39). Yet as shown in Zellentin\n2022, 300, n. 31, other Qur’anic manuscripts have rijs at Q 8:11.\n330 rijz/rujz", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This\nobservation supports the contention that the Qur’anic rijs/rijz ambivalence is not just a\nresult of minor and random inaccuracies in the Qur’an’s textual transmission but rather\nis rooted in a facet of pre- Qur’anic language.6\nA final passage entering into the issue is Q 74:4–5, where according to the Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim\nreading of the Qur’anic text the Messenger is commanded to “purify his clothes” (v. 4) and\nto “shun al- rujz” (v. 5: wa- l- rujza fa- hjur). Rujz, with a u vowel, is a hapax legomenon in the\nḤafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim version of the Qur’an, but t here w ere scholars like Ibn Muḥayṣin who reput-\nedly advocated reading the consonantal ductus r- j- z as rujz rather than rijz in other places as\nwell (see MQ 1:108–109 and MQQ 1:61, on Q 2:59, or MQ 3:143 and MQQ 2:395 on Q 7:134).\nWith regard to Q 74:5, too, t here is some textual uncertainty, in so far as Islamic sources\nreport that some of the canonical readers embraced the alternative reading rijz instead of\nrujz h ere (MQ 10:158; MQQ 7:259). Accordingly, the distribution of the vocalisations rijz vs\nrujz in in the Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim text may be largely accidental. It is therefore tempting to posit\nthat all nominal occurrences of r- j- z o ught to be vocalised identically, w hether one gives\npreference to rijz or as rujz. If one assumes the canonical rasm of Q 74:5 to be correct, the\nverse would need to be understood to mean “and shun the punishment (al- rijz/al- rujz).”\nHowever, the reference to purification in the preceding verse 4 (wa- thiyābaka fa-ṭ ahhir,\n“and purify yourS clothes”) might well lead one to read Q 74:5 as exhorting the Messenger\nto shun moral impurity rather than divine punishment; and the fact that transitive hajara\nmeans “to shun, avoid, forsake, or abandon s.th. or s.o.” (CDKA 278) is also more easily\nreconciled with the grammatical object in Q 74:5 being impurity.7 Such an understanding\nof Q 74:5, which arguably maximises contextual coherence, would fit most organically with\na hy po thet ic al emendation of the consonantal ductus of Q 74:5 from r- j- z to r- j- s, unless\none is prepared to adopt the view provisionally intimated above that the nouns rijz and rijs\nhad already under gone a partial semantic merger in the Qur’anic milieu. Against this line of\nreasoning, it is pos sib le to object that r- j- z in the sense of punishment is the more difficult\nand hence putatively original text for Q 74:5, seeing that it entails a certain disruption of\ncontextual expectations arising from the preceding verse. However, given the confusion\nsurrounding Qur’anic occurrences of r- j- s and r- j- z it is not immediately clear that customary\nlectio difficilior arguments are applicable h ere.\nRijz/rujz and Syriac rūgzā. Coming fin ally to the issue of a potential non-A rabic ety-\nmology, it has been suggested that the word rujz may derive from Syriac rūgzā, “wrath.” As\noriginally noted by Richard Bell, the Peshitta employs rūgzā in rendering John the Baptist’s\ndenunciation of the Pharisees and Sadduccees coming to be baptised by him in Matt 3:7\n5 See also Ṭab. 10:280, on Q 7:71, citing the view that rijz and rijs have the same meaning and that rijs\ndeveloped into the variant rijz.\n6 This develops a point made to me by Saqib Hussain.\n7 Cf. the translation of Q 74:5 in Arberry 1955 (“and defilement flee!”) and similarly Paret 2001.\nrijz/rujz 331", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is however the most questionable aspect of Bell’s conjecture, in so far as other\nQur’anic occurrences of hajara (Q 4:43, 19:46, 23:67, 73:10) are consistently amenable to\nbeing translated as “to shun, avoid, forsake, abandon” rather than “to flee.” Especially when\ntaking into consideration the general uncertainty besetting the alternative vocalisations rijz\nvs rujz across dif ere nt readings of the Qur’an’s consonantal skeleton, it seems reasonable to\nsever Bell’s proposal from the par tic ul ar context of Q 74:5 and to extend it to all occurrences\nof r- j- z, as already envisaged by Ahrens (CQ 28–29). The approximate rendering of rijz (or\nrujz) as “punishment” or a par tic ul ar type of punishment delineated at the beginning of\nthis entry could certainly encompass undertones of divine wrath.\nThis line of thought is buttressed by further comparative data. That Qur’anic rijz/rujz\nand Syriac rūgzā can function in a roughly equivalent capacity is demonstrated by the fact\nthat Ephrem applies the Syriac word to the divine punishment narrowly escaped by the\npeople of Nineveh (Beck 1970b, no. 1:732.1262; see also Beck 1970a, no. 2:87, and Beck\n1970b, no. 2:303). Even more compellingly, Witztum has collated vario us Syriac and other\nAramaic parallels that employ rūgzā or other derivatives of the root r- g- z in very similar\ncontexts to the Qur’an (Witztum 2020, 461–466). This includes, for example, the rendering\nof Gen 18:23–24— dealing with the impending destruction of Sodom—in Targum Onqelos\nand the Peshitta, which Witztum convincingly links with the announcement in Q 29:34\nthat “rijz from heaven” w ill descend on the wicked inhabitants of the “settlement” (qaryah)\nof Lot. Fi nally, we saw that Q 7:71 explic itly couples rijs—in the sense normally associated\nwith rijz (or rujz)— with the term ghaḍab, “wrath,” which is precisely the meaning of the\nSyriac term u nder discussion. The conjecture that the Qur’anic semantics of rijz/rujz is at\nleast informed by its Syriac cognate is therefore highly plausible. It is in fact quite conceiv-\nable that rijz/rujz is an outright loan, though it would be of interest to undertake a wider\nattempt to trace derivatives of r- j- z in early Arabic texts, in order to ascertain whether the\nArabisation of Syriac rūgzā might have been facilitated by the immanent semantics of\nthe Arabic root.\nrijs | filth, impurity, abomination\n→ rijz/rujz\nrajama tr. | to stone s.o., to pelt s.o. with stones\n→ rajīm\nrajīm | deserving to be pelted; accursed (?)\nFurther vocabulary discussed: shayṭān | devil a l- shayṭān | the devil, Satan j inn coll. |\ndemons, jinn r ajama tr. | t o stone s.o., to pelt s.o. with stones r ujūm pl. | p rojectiles\n332 rijs", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Rajīm has\nlong been linked with Classical Ethiopic rәgum, “accursed” (NB 25 and 47; CQ 39; FVQ\n139–140; Kropp 2007, 336–337; for the Ethiopic word, refer to Leslau 1991, 465). But quite\nin de pen dently of any etymological considerations, even from a purely inner- Qur’anic\nperspective the word rajīm exhibits a tangible semantic vacillation between pelting or\nstoning, on the one hand, and cursing, on the other, a fact that is succinctly registered\nalready by Ahrens (CQ 39). Thus, the verb rajama is well attested in the sense of “to stone”\nor “to pelt with stones” (Q 11:91, 18:20, 19:46, 26:116, 36:18, 44:20), and Q 67:5 speaks of\nthe rujūm or “projectiles” by which the dev ils or shayāṭīn are repelled from heaven (see\nin more detail u nder → jinn). All of these verses would support interpreting the attribute\nrajīm, especially when applied to demons in general in Q 15:17 and 81:25, in the sense of\n“pelted” or “deserving to be pelted.” It is pertinent to note in this context that Talmudic\nevidence suggests that late antique Jews too sometimes employed language implying “that\nSatan could be warded of by throwing things at him” (Silverstein 2013, 22–23).1 On the\nother hand, in two Qur’anic passages Satan or the devil is denounced by God as being\nrajīm (Q 15:34, 38:77), followed by the words, “The curse / my curse shall be upon youS\nuntil the day of judgement” (Q 15:35, 38:78: wa-i nna ʿalayka l-l aʿnata/laʿnatī ilā yawmi\nl- dīn). It would not be unreasonable to take this latter utterance to explicate the meaning\nof rajīm, giving us the equivalent “cursed,” which is in fact a gloss preserved as part of the\nearly Islamic exegetical rec ord (Ṭab. 14:67, on Q 15:35).\nOne way of explaining these shifting semantics of Qur’anic rajīm would be to posit,\nwith Adam Silverstein, that al-s hayṭān al-r ajīm reached the Qur’anic milieu as a fixed\nbut semantically opaque formula, with rajīm forming a sort of “fixed ‘surname’ ” of the\ndevil whose original meaning had been forgotten and was therefore amenable to being\nreconstructed in dif er ent ways, whether as “accursed” or as “pelted” (Silverstein 2013).\nSilverstein additionally hypothesises that the original meaning of al-s hayṭān al-r ajīm, or\nof what ever non-A rabic phrase stands b ehind it, was “Satan the accuser” (Silverstein 2013,\n28–32). It bears underscoring, in any case, that Arabic rajīm was apt to be understood as\na perfectly regular passive verbal adjective derived from rajama, just as qatīl or dhabīḥ\nmean “killed” and “slaughtered” (Wright 1974, 1:136). In fact, rajīm occurs in exactly this\nmeaning at the beginning of a poem from the dīwān of al- Aʿshā Maymūn, which laments\nthat during his entire life man is “a target of pelting (rajīm) by the uncertainties of de-\nstructive fate (rayb al-m anūn) and by disease befalling his f amily and grief” (Ḥusayn 1983,\n1 Kropp’s objection that the “invisible Satan can hardly be stoned” (Kropp 2007, 336–337), however con-\nvincing at first sight, should accordingly be qualified. In fact, while late antique demons were invisible, this\ndoes not mean that they w ere entirely immaterial, as illustrated by a Talmudic passage describing how some\nporters unwittingly place a barrel of wine on the ear of a demon, who responds by causing the barrel to burst\n(Ronis 2018, 15–16). Also of interest are two occurrences of the attribute rgima in Mandaic incantations designed\nto ward of curses and evil forces, which are noted by Silverstein (Silverstein 2013, 25, citing Yamauchi 1967,\n228–229 = no. 20:19, and 274–275 = no. 27:14). Rgima is predicated of “evil mouths” here, next to “muzzled” and\n“closed,” and Yamauchi renders rgima as “stoned” in both cases.

The verb raḥima (“to\nhave mercy”; e.g., Q 2:286, 3:32, 6:16.155, 67:28), too, invariably has God as its explicit or\nimplied subject. The centrality of divine mercy or compassion to the Qur’anic conception\nof God receives par tic u lar stress at Q 6:12.54, which programmatically declare that God\nhas “imposed mercy on himself” (kataba ʿalā nafsihi l- raḥmata).

The Qur’anic God is, after\nall, eminently capable of wrath (→ ghaḍab), too.\nExplicit Qur’anic statements about God’s mercy occur from the end of the early Meccan\nperiod onwards (see further below on issues of inner- Qur’anic chronology) and remain\nvery frequent thereafter: even if the basmalah— the surah- initial invocation → ˻bi- smi llāhi\nl- raḥmāni l- raḥīm, “In the name of God, the truly Merciful”—is excluded from the count,\nthe root r-ḥ - m appears in over three hundred Qur’anic verses, making mercy and com-\npassion one of the most common theological notions in the Qur’an.2 Mining this material\nin an inevitably condensed fashion, the pre sent entry begins with a general explication\nof the Qur’anic conception of divine mercy. Subsequently, the focus is specifically on the\ndivine name al- raḥmān: after reviewing the wider background against which the Qur’an’s\nuse of this appellation must be placed, the article tracks its Qur’anic emergence towards\nthe end of the early Meccan period and its frequent employment in a par tic u lar subset of\nthe later Meccan surahs, the so- called “raḥmān surahs.” Fi nally, the entry examines the\nsemantic relationship between al- raḥmān and the adjective raḥīm, “merciful,” which are\nmost prominently combined in the basmalah.\nGod’s mercy in the Qur’an: a synopsis. With regard to the concept of compassion\nor mercy in the Hebrew Bible, it has aptly been said that compassion is “something\nthat goes beyond what ought to be given” (NIDOTTE 3:1094). The Qur’an, too, under-\nstands God as someone who consistently bestows more than he rightfully owes (see also\nu nder → anʿama). God’s mercy is evidenced, inter alia, by his sending of messengers\nand revelations (→ nazzala; see also under → rasūl and → nabiyy), instances of which\nare expressly described as acts of divine mercy (raḥmatan; e.g., Q 7:52, 21:107, 45:20,\n46:12). The under lying rationale would seem to be that the preaching of messengers\nlike Muhammad provides their recipients with reminders (see under → dhakkara) of\nGod and his expectations, reminders that draw attention to the manifold cosmic “signs”\n(singular: → āyah) of God’s existence, power, and grace, and that ofer humans precious\nassistance in passing the moral scrutiny to which God subjects them during their earthly\nlives (see under → balā).3 Some scholars also consider the very act of creating the world,\nset up in such a way as to benefit humans, to manifest God’s mercy (Rahman 2009, 6;\nMarshall 1999, 79; Reynolds 2020, 97–101).4 While this connection is less overt in the\nQur’an than the merciful quality of God’s sending of messengers, the general idea is\nplausible.

Another passage that\ndetects divine mercy in the workings of nature is Q 7:57, which casts the winds bringing\nrain- bearing clouds as heralds of God’s mercy.\nA more explicit aspect of divine mercy in the Qur’an is God’s compassionate interven-\ntion in the life of deserving individuals, such as God’s granting the prayer of “his servant\nZechariah” for a child (Q 19:2–15) or his merciful response (verb: istajāba) to Job’s call\nfor relief from his sufering (Q 21:84; see also the remarks on ajāba and istajāba, “to\nrespond,” u nder → allāh). Fi nally, God’s mercy shows itself in his readiness to pardon\nsins (verb: ghafara) when humans beseech him for forgiveness (see also Reynolds 2020,\n104–107). This is indicated by the frequent collocation of the divine attributes ghafūr,\n“forgiving,” and raḥīm, “merciful” (e.g., Q 2:173.182.192 etc., 12:53.98, 14:36), and also\nby seven verses in which ghafara, “to forgive,” and raḥima, “to have mercy,” figure in\npleonasms like “forgive us and have mercy on us” (Q 2:286: wa-g hfir lanā wa-r ḥamnā;\nsee also Q 7:23.149.155, 11:47, 23:109.118).5\nThe notions of divine mercy and divine forgiveness are furthermore bound up with\nthat of divine love, expressed by the roots ḥ-b -b and w-d -d . All three concepts— divine\nlove, divine forgiveness, and divine mercy— intersect in the Medinan verse Q 3:31: the\nMessenger is commanded to urge those who “love God” to “follow me, so that God w ill\nlove youp [in return] and forgive you your sins (fa- ttabiʿūnī yuḥbibkumu llāhu wa- yaghfir\nlakum dhunūbakum); and God is forgiving (ghafūr) and merciful (raḥīm).” One infers\nthat God’s compassionate clemency towards certain persons is motivated by the fact that\nhe loves them: mercy- as- forgiveness is grounded in divine love. The association between\ndivine mercy, divine forgiveness, and divine love is also discernible in other passages.\nThus, God is given the epithet “loving” or “afectionate” (wadūd) in Q 11:90, together with\nraḥīm, and in Q 85:14, together with ghafūr, while Q 19:96 promises that “the Merciful\nwill assign afection” to those who believe and do righ teous deeds (sa-y ajʿalu lahumu\nl- raḥmānu wuddā; Jomier 1957, 377–378). This may be a promise that the inhabitants of\nparadise will be recipients of divine love.6 The fact that Q 3:31 casts divine love as a re-\naction to those who manifest their love for God by following the Qur’anic Messenger is\nsignificant, for the Qur’an generally depicts God’s love for h umans as commensurate with\ntheir ethico- religious desert (Rahbar 1960, 172–175; Reynolds 2020, 160–161). In the later\nMeccan and the Medinan surahs, this nexus of h uman merit and divine love (or, conversely\nhuman culpability and the absence of divine love) is inexorably driven home by verse-fi nal\naffirmations that “God loves the X” (inna llāha yuḥibbu l- X; e.g., Q 2:195.222, 3:76.159,\n5:13.42), where X stands for some collective virtue term like “ those who do good deeds”\n(al- muḥsinīn) or “ those who fear God” (al-m uttaqīn), and by the opposite formula “God\ndoes not love the X” (inna llāha lā yuḥibbu l- . . . ; e.g., Q 2:190, 3:32.57.140), where X\nrefers to some normatively objectionable trait.7 It is therefore quite clear that God’s love\n5 For a verse combining other derivatives of gh- f- r and r-ḥ - m, see Q 3:157.

Understood in a non- reductionist fashion, the Qur’an’s attribution of love to\nGod plays an impor tant theological role: it explains why the omnipotent creator of the\ncosmos should be sufficiently invested in human afairs in order to reward righ teousness\nand punish sins, rather than passing over them in sage indiference. God, the Qur’an is\nadamant, is emotionally attuned to and afected by the moral status of human actions\n(see also under → ghaḍiba).\nThe opposite of divine mercy and forgiveness is divine punishment, as illustrated by\nstatements in which raḥima and ʿadhdhaba (“to torment, punish, or chastise”) or raḥmah\nand ʿadhāb (“torment, punishment, chastisement”) function as antonyms (see Q 7:156,\n17:54.57, 29:21.23, 57:13, 76:31). As intimated earlier, in tandem with stressing God’s mercy\nthe Qur’an also portrays God as susceptible to wrath (ghaḍab; → ghaḍiba) and as chastising\nsinners and unbelievers (see u nder → rijz/rujz and → ʿadhdhaba). Such divine retribution\ntakes the form of inner-h istorical punishments like the annihilation of the p eople of Lot\n(i.e., Sodom and Gomorrah; e.g., Q 29:33–35) and of God’s condemning many h umans and\njinn to eternal torment in hell at the end of time (see u nder → khalada and → jahannam).\nYet as many Qur’anic verses underscore, nobody sufering divine punishment has reason to\ncomplain that he or she has thereby been “wronged” (verb: → ẓalama): “we did not wrong\nthem; rather, they wronged themselves” (Q 11:101: wa- mā ẓalamnāhum wa- lākin ẓalamū\nanfusahum; similarly, 16:118 and 43:76). The basic point is that inveterate unbelievers and\nsinners merely receive the penalty appropriate to their prior misdeeds. God’s judgement\nis unfailingly just (see Rahbar 1960 and Marshall 1999, 78–89, and also under → ḥisāb),\nas underscored already in the early Meccan passage Q 99:7–8: “Whoever does a speck’s\nweight of good w ill see it, // and whoever does a speck’s weight of evil w ill see it.” It is true\nthat the Qur’an has a marked tendency to express God’s justice in negative terms, e.g., by\ndenying that he might do wrong rather than by predicating of him the positive attribute\n“just” (Fakhry 1994, 14–15). But positive assertions of God’s “fairness” (qisṭ) are not entirely\nlacking (Q 3:18, 10:4.47.54; see u nder → ẓalama), and generally speaking the Qur’an’s em-\nphasis on divine justice is clear and consistent throughout.\nGod’s justice raises the question of the scope that God has for proving himself merciful\nand compassionate: is the Qur’anic God adequately described by an “unlimited readiness\nto forgive,” as maintained by a con temporary Muslim theologian (Khorchide 2012, 32)?\nAn affirmative answer might be inferred from Q 39:53: the Qur’anic Messenger is com-\nmanded to tell those of God’s “servants” who have “become guilty of excess to their own\ndetriment” (qul yā-ʿ ibādiya lladhīna asrafū ʿalā anfusihim) that they must not “despair of\nGod’s mercy” (lā taqnaṭū min raḥmati llāhi), for God “forgives all sins” (yaghfiru l- dhunūba\njamīʿan).9 This would seem to point to an unlimited and unconditional notion of divine\nmercy, and the fact that in Q 7:156 the divine voice affirms that “my mercy comprehends\nall things” (wa- raḥmatī wasiʿat kulla shayʾin) could be taken to point in the same direction\n(see Khorchide 2012, 45).

The suspicion\nthat the Qur’anic conception of divine mercy must, for the sake of theological consistency,\nbe of a conditional nature is borne out by a broader consideration of the mature theology\nof the later Meccan and of the Medinan surahs, undertaken in the following paragraphs,\nwhich yields the result that divine mercy has clearly specifiable preconditions and that\nentrenched repudiators and sinners are excluded from it (thus already Marshall 1999,\n78–89). In examining the issue, it is vital to bracket any instinctive temptation to regard\nunconditional and limitless mercy as a self- evidently superior divine trait than a conditional\nand limited conception of mercy.\nA first observation to make is that despite the Qur’anic stress on divine justice, God is\nnot represented as a niggardly accountant. Rather, God’s unfailing justice is exercised first\nand foremost where it benefits humans. Consequently, those who live a life that is charac-\nterised, or at least predominantly characterised, by belief and right eousness, will receive\nfrom God the just “wage” (→ ajr) that they have merited by virtue of their good deeds, or\neven more than their just wage. Their evil deeds, by contrast, will be graciously cancelled\nout (e.g., Q 29:7; see under → kaffara). This is why, as registered elsewhere, promises of\neschatological wage are often joined with promises of divine forgiveness (maghfirah; e.g.,\nQ 67:12; see again under → ajr). The upshot is that at least a fter the early Meccan period,\nand quite possibly already before this time (cf. Q 99:6–8 and 101:6–9), it is not assumed\nthat true believers w ill be able to steer absolutely clear of some mea sure of minor or in-\nadvertent wrongdoing. God, however, w ill mercifully forgo to take them to task for it.10\nWith regard to those who have acquired a claim to eschatological wage, God therefore\ncompassionately goes beyond what he owes.\nAt the same time, the Qur’an makes it clear that God’s forgiveness and cancelling out of\nevil deeds must not be taken for granted as if they w ere an automatic entitlement. Rather,\nthe availability of divine forgiveness alongside eschatological wages means that God is open\nto h uman repentance and pleas for divine forgiveness. Thus, Q 6:54 (one of the two verses\nproclaiming God’s self-i mposition of mercy that was partially quoted above; see also Reyn-\nolds 2020, 96) states: “whoever of you does evil in ignorance and then repents (→ tāba)\nafterwards and puts t hings right—he [namely, God] w ill be forgiving and merciful.” Hence,\nGod’s mercy is available to t hose sinners (specifically, inadvertent sinners) who sincerely re-\npent of their misdeeds, plead for God’s forgiveness (istaghfara; e.g., Q 3:135, 4:110, 5:74), and\ntake concrete remedial action. Even if one has “mixed right eous and evil actions” (khalaṭū\nʿamalan ṣāliḥan wa-ā kha ra sayyiʾan), as Q 9:102 memorably puts it, t hose who “penitently\nturn” (→ tāba) to God w ill find that God w ill turn to them in forgiveness. But it is crucial\nto appreciate that none of this means that God’s readiness to forgive is unlimited or uncon-\nditional. Accordingly, the Qur’an sometimes declares certain ofences to be unpardonable\nor beyond repentance, such as the sins of “partnering” or “associating” (→ ashraka) some\nother being with God (Q 4:48.116) or of relapsing into repudiation a fter having espoused\nbelief (Q 3:90; see again u nder → tāba). Moreover, h umans are expected to ask for God’s\nforgiveness in good time rather than leaving it u ntil the moment of their death (Q 4:17–18).\n10 However, note that the Medinan verse Q 3:30 still avers that at the final judgement every one will be con-\nfronted by the good and the evil he or she has done (yawma tajidu kullu nafsin mā ʿamilat min khayrin muḥḍaran\nwa- mā ʿamilat min sūʾin).\n338 al- raḥmān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:361", "title": "Page 361", "locator": "pdf_page:361", "text": "Already in the Meccan Surah 10, the figure of Phar aoh, who only submitted to God when\nfaced by the imminent prospect of divine punishment, exemplifies an act of conversion that\nsimply came too late in order to be efective (Q 10:90–92; see Sinai 2019a). Other passages,\ntoo, discount it as insufficient to believe in God only when “seeing” the deleterious conse-\nquences of one’s unbelief materialise (Q 6:158, 32:29, 40:84–85).\nAccordingly, the Qur’anic understanding of God’s mercy does not entail that God is\nunconditionally and limitlessly forgiving (Marshall 1999, 82; Reynolds 2020, 97), just as\nhe is not unconditionally loving. But what, precisely, are the factors that condition and\nlimit God’s mercy? The announcement in Q 39:53, quoted above, that God’s “servants”\nmay hope that God will “forgive all sins” ofers a clue: it is those who in princip le succeed\nin maintaining a functioning and meaningful relationship with God who are bidden not to\ndespair of his mercy. Similarly, Q 15:49 commands the Messenger to “announce” to God’s\n“servants” that God is “the one who forgives, the one who is merciful” (nabbiʾ ʿibādī annī\nanā l- ghafūru l- raḥīm). As noted elsewhere (→ rabb), the word ʿabd, “servant,” has a dual\nmeaning in the Qur’an, designating both humans in general, by virtue of the fact that they\nought to serve God, and those humans in par tic u lar who actually do serve God. It stands\nto reason that in Q 15:49 and 39:53 it is the latter meaning of “servant” that is applicable.11\nHence, qualifying as one of God’s “servants” in the sense that is contextually relevant may\nbe surmised to require mono the istic belief, a commitment to right eousness, and a dispo-\nsition to turn to God in genuine repentance when appropriate and to plead with him to\n“forgive” and “have mercy” on one, as the believers pray in Q 2:286. By contrast, obdurate\nrepudiators and sinners who choose not to cultivate an ongoing relationship with God w ill\nnot benefit from his merciful remission of sins.12 This interpretation is corroborated by a\ncloser look at Q 7:156, briefly referenced above, where the divine voice affirms, “With my\npunishment I strike whomever I will, and my mercy comprehends all things. I will decree\nit (sa- aktubuhā) for those who are God- fearing, who give the alms, and who believe in our\nsigns.” The verse makes it unequivocally clear that God’s mercy is bestowed on those who\nare already and demonstrably, though not necessarily unfailingly, committed to living a\ngodly life.13 Similarly, Q 7:56 encourages the hearers to “call” on God “in fear and longing”\n11 For other verses combining ʿabd and the root r-ḥ - m, see Q 9:104 (on which see below), 18:65, 19:2, 23:109\n(cf. also 21:84). In Q 27:19, Solomon prays to God to “let me enter, by your mercy, among your righ teous servants”\n(wa- adkhilnī bi- raḥmatika fī ʿibādika l- ṣāliḥīn). Read literally, this implies that God’s mercy or compassion may\nalready act upon somebody who is not yet among God’s “servants” in the narrower sense. But this does not raise\nany difficulties for the interpretation here developed, for it is clear that some aspects of divine mercy— such as\nthe sending of messengers—do indeed attain all h umans. It is only mercy-a s- forgiveness that would seem to be\nconfined to those who have already embarked on a godly life.\n12 As Marshall notes, unbelievers participate in God’s mercy only in the indirect way that they, too, receive,\nand would have been able to benefit from, certain “universal expressions of the divine mercy,” such as God’s\nsending of prophets (Marshall 1999, 83).\n13 That Q 7:156 does not undermine the general impression that God’s mercy has preconditions is confirmed\nby another verse combining the noun raḥmah, “mercy,” with the root w- s-ʿ , namely, Q 6:147, which affirms that\nGod is “endowed with comprehensive mercy (dhū raḥmatin wāsiʿatin), but his violent force w ill not be averted\nfrom those people who are sinners (wa- lā yuraddu baʾsuhu ʿani l- qawmi l- mujrimīn).” A third verse commenting\non God’s comprehensive mercy is Q 40:7, where the angels supplicating on behalf of the believers and petitioning\nGod to forgive t hose who repent commence their plea by saying, “Our Lord, you comprehend all t hings in mercy\nand knowledge (wasiʿta kulla shayʾin raḥmatan wa- ʿilman).” As regards specifically the comprehensiveness or\nuniversality of God’s mercy, expressed by collocating raḥmah and w- s-ʿ , there is no need to understand this to\nimply that God is unconditionally and limitlessly merciful and forgiving. With re spect to humans, the universal-\nity of divine mercy might, for instance, manifest itself in God’s sending of prophetic messengers and in the fact\nthat he generally provides humans with ample signs and reminders to guide them (see also Marshall 1999, 83).\nal- raḥmān 339", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In light of this, when Q 9:104 affirms that “God accepts repentance from\nhis servants” (anna llāha huwa yaqbalu l- tawbata ʿan ʿibādihi), the word “servants” ought\nto be again understood in its more exclusive sense.\nThe precondition for receiving divine mercy- as- forgiveness, then, is a prior commit-\nment to God, or being one of his “servants” in the more exclusive sense of the word;\none cannot hope to tap into the “trea sures” (Q 17:100, 38:9) of divine compassion and\nforgiveness from outside a confessional and moral rapport with God. This bond need\nnot date back far into the past, though: as Usman Shaikh has convincingly observed,14\nthe Qur’anic account of the Egyptian sorcerers’ conversion to God, in the wake of their\ninability to match the confirmatory miracles of Moses and Aaron (Q 7:120–126, 20:70–73,\n26:46–51), strongly implies a positive assessment of the sorcerers and the subsequent fulfil-\nment of their supplication for divine forgiveness (Q 20:73, 26:51; cf. Abraham’s statement\nin 26:82). A courageous act of conversion prior to the final judgement, therefore, can be\nsufficient to establish the rapport with God that permits someone to hope for the latter’s\ncompassionate forgiveness. Nonetheless, even so God’s merciful forgiveness is not uncon-\nditional. Inversely, certain objectionable acts, which are explicated in Q 4:17–18.48.116,\nwill eliminate the basis for receiving divine forgiveness: if one neglects to repent of one’s\nmissteps in a timely fashion, it will erode one’s relationship with God; and if one goes so\nfar as to “partner” or “associate” God with other allegedly divine beings, it will terminate\none’s bond of servanthood with God altogether.\nDoes the preceding entail that access to divine mercy is guaranteed by and confined\nto outward membership in the Qur’anic community, to the exclusion of other religious\ncommunities? One might conclude this from the promise of divine mercy to “ those who\nare God- fearing, who give the alms, and who believe in our signs” in Q 7:156, discussed\nabove, since it is followed by the further specification that the recipients of God’s mercy\nare those who “follow the prophet of those not hitherto endowed with scripture” (al-\nnabiyy al-u mmī; → ummī), namely, Muhammad (Q 7:157). Yet the fact that Muhammad’s\nfollowers are, unsurprisingly, assured of divine mercy is not necessarily equivalent to\nthe proposition that God’s mercy is bestowed only on Muhammad’s followers. It cer-\ntainly seems clear enough that Q 7:156–157 does not apply retrospectively, since the\nQur’an pre sents figures who lived well before Muhammad as beneficiaries of divine\nmercy (e.g., Q 7:72.151). As we just saw, this would seem to include even the Egyptian\nsorcerers. With regard to Muhammad’s contemporaries, too, some Qur’anic data call\ninto doubt an exclusivist reading of Q 7:156–157. For one, Q 7:157 is part of a Medinan\ninsertion to Surah 7 (see under → ummī), whereas the Meccan surahs do not draw hard\ncommunal bound aries between dif er ent mono the istic confessions (HCI 177–179). This\nmakes it unlikely that a Meccan verse like Q 15:49, when first proclaimed, would have\npresupposed a confessionally narrow notion of God’s servants. As regards the Medinan\nlayer of the Qur’an, too, certain statements tip the scales away from a confessionally\nexclusivist understanding of access to divine mercy. In par tic u lar, two Medinan verses,\nQ 2:62 and 5:69, unequivocally promise eschatological reward not only to the Qur’anic\n“believers,” but also to Jews, Christians, and → ṣābiʾūn who “believe in God and the final\n14 The observation is made in Shaikh’s unpublished Oxford MPhil thesis on divine responsiveness in the\nQur’an.\n340 al- raḥmān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Other verses, such as\nQ 3:110.113–114.199, similarly presuppose that there are at least some believers among the\n“scripture-o wners” (→ ˻ahl al-k itāb), i.e., among Jews and Christians. Such statements\nreflect what one might call the Qur’an’s mixed- bag assessment of con temporary Jews\nand Christians (see further under → ˻ahl al-k itāb). In the pre sent context, the patent\nassumption that there are believing Jews and Christians lends support to the contention\nthat the “servants” of God who may count on his compassionate forgiveness include at\nleast some members of the communities who are promised eschatological reward in\nQ 2:62 and 5:69, especially given the repeated association of eschatological wage (ajr)\nwith divine forgiveness (maghfirah).\nThis is not to overlook that the Qur’an does seem to expect Jews and Christians who\nare to be credited with genuine belief in God, and who may consequently hope for divine\nreward and forgiveness, to adopt a rigorous version of mono the ism incompatible with\nbelief in the divinity of Jesus and to subscribe to a prophetology incompatible with denying\nMuhammad’s prophethood (see again under → aslama). But generally speaking, the only\nreligious community in the Qur’anic environment whose adherents are eo ipso deemed\nto have no immediate access to divine forgiveness are the pagan “associators” (alladhīna\nashrakū, al- mushrikūn) or “repudiators” (alladhīna kafarū, al- kāfirūn, al- kuffār; → kafara).\nEven they, of course, have some access to divine mercy, namely, by “surrendering them-\nselves” (→ aslama) to the one God and becoming believers. Th ose, whoever, who miss\nthe opportunity and consequently end up in hell will indeed be irrevocably placed outside\nthe sphere of God’s mercy: as Q 57:13 says, in the afterlife the believers w ill be surrounded\nby a “wall with a gate, on the inside of which t here will be mercy and on the outside of\nwhich, opposite it, there will be punishment (bāṭinuhu fīhi l- raḥmatu wa- ẓāhiruhu min\nqibalihi l- ʿadhāb).”15 The claim that in the hereafter (→ al-ā khirah) many humans will be\npermanently cut of from any hope of divine compassion is surely the starkest limitation\nthat the Qur’an places on God’s mercy. Yet the fact that the Qur’anic text ofers virtually\nno compelling support for the idea of universal salvation (a claim denied in Khorchide\n2012, 47–57; see also under → khalada) is entirely consistent with the Islamic scripture’s\npervasive insistence that the pre sent life is a temporally l imited prelude to an eternity of\nconsequences: the finite number of choices that humans make during the finite span of\ntheir earthly existence is credited with infinite significance.\n“Merciful” as a divine epithet prior to the Qur’an. The remainder of this entry will\nturn from the Qur’an’s general understanding of divine mercy to the Qur’anic use of the\ndivine name al- raḥmān in par tic u lar. It is worthwhile to begin by probing this epithet’s\nchequered prehistory of a millennium and a half before the Qur’an, which illustrates the\ndepth of the Islamic scripture’s enrootedness in Near Eastern religious history. The word\nis first documented in the Akkadian- Aramaic inscription of Tall al- Fakhariyyah from the\nninth c entury BCE, whose Aramaic text calls the god Hadad a “merciful god” (ʾlh rḥmn; see\nGreenfield 2000, 381–382).

The first of t hese two verses includes a description of YHWH as “a merciful\nand gracious god” (ēl raḥûm wəḥannūn; see also Joel 2:13). Targum Onqelos and Targum\nPseudo- Jonathan render this by translating raḥûm as raḥmana.16\nThe word raḥmānā also figures in Syriac Christian lit er a ture: Ephrem prays that “the\nMerciful One” (raḥmānā)— i.e., God— might “cleanse” heretics (Beck 1957b, no. 22:16);17\nJacob of Sarug explains that God, on account of being merciful (mraḥḥem), is called “the\nMerciful One” (raḥmānā; Bedjan 1905–1910, 1:628, l. 10);18 and elsewhere Jacob depicts\nMary as imploring her unborn son to reveal to Joseph the truth about her virginal concep-\ntion with the words, “O Merciful One (raḥmānā), merciful as you are (da- kmā raḥmān),\nhave pity on his [i.e., Joseph’s] right eousness” (Kollamparampil 2010, 86–87, l. 676 of Syriac\ntext = l. 675 of En glish translation). Nonetheless, it appears that raḥmānā does not have the\nsame status of a major divine name in Syriac lit er a ture as in rabbinic discourse; according\nto some scholars, it appears less frequently than the form mraḥḥmānā (GQ 1:112–113,\nn. 1; Greenfield 2000, 385–386), which is, for instance, the Peshitta’s rendering of raḥûm\nat Exod 34:6 and Joel 2:13 (see also SL 831).19 The background to the Qur’anic divine name\nal- raḥmān may therefore surmised to be rabbinic, even if the general theme of God’s mercy\nis of course frequent in the Christian tradition as well.20\nWithin the Qur’an’s more immediate Arabian environment, the currency of al- raḥmān\nin Qur’anic discourse is reminiscent of, and most likely historically linked to, the use\nof rḥmnn = raḥmānān (“the Merciful”) in Jewish (or Judaising) and Christian Ḥimyarite\ninscriptions from the late fourth or early fifth century CE onwards (Greenfield 2000,\n387–389; Robin 2000, 57; Gajda 2009, 224–232; Robin and Rijziger 2018, 280–283). It\nwas very prob ably from South Arabia that the term raḥmān entered Old Arabic.21 This\ndevelopment predates the Qur’an, since al- raḥmān is already attested in poetry that has\na good claim to being either pre- Qur’anic or at least con temporary with (but not im-\npacted by) the Qur’an (e.g., Wellhausen 1884, no. 165:6, and Qabāwah 1987, 182, no. 3:36,\nboth of which are cited in Brockelmann 1922, 106; see al- Farāhī 2002, 185–189; Greenfield\n2000, 389–390; Sinai 2019b, 20, 29, 34, 53, 59). The poetic data reinforce, and are in turn\n16 On the date of Targum Pseudo- Jonathan, see Hayward 1989a and Hayward 1989b, who casts doubt on the\nclaim that the work must be post- Qur’anic.\n17 I owe this reference to SL 1457.\n18 I owe this reference to Yousef Kouriyhe; see https:// corpuscoranicum . de / kontexte / index / sure / 1 / vers\n/2 /i ntertext /1 246 (accessed 6 November 2021). For another instance in which Jacob calls God raḥmānā, see\nBedjan 1905–1910, 1:460, l. 1 (which has abā raḥmānā, “merciful f ather”). This latter reference goes back, via\nRobin 2020–2021, 77, to Jack Tannous.\n19 Christian use of the divine name raḥmānā is also reported or at least implied in texts describing the\nmartyrdom of the Christians of Najrān in 523 CE, such as the Book of the Ḥimyarites (Robin 2020–2021, 75–77).\nThis may reflect peculiarities of local usage, namely, the prominence of the divine name raḥmānān in Yemen, as\ndocumented by Sabaic inscriptions from the mono the istic period (see below in the main text).\n20 See, for instance, the liturgical invocation “Lord, have mercy” (kurie eleēson; e.g., Matt 17:15), or the quota-\ntion of Joel 2:13 in Apostolic Constitutions 7:33 = Metzger 1985–1987, 3:67, describing God as eleēmōn and oiktirmōn.\n21 Greenfield 2000, 389–390, is more doubtful and accentuates contact with the Jewish tribes of Yathrib.\n342 al- raḥmān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As Crone points out, the designation al- raḥmān figures in utterances that the Qur’an\nascribes to Muhammad’s pagan opponents, and verses that have often been understood\nas documenting the Qur’anic pagans’ lack of familiarity with the name al- raḥmān, such as\nQ 25:60, do not in fact warrant this inference (QP 66–68). It is true that Q 17:110 finds it\nnecessary to underscore that it is one and the same whether one calls upon allāh or upon\nal-r aḥmān: “Say, ‘Callp upon God or call upon the Merciful; whichever you call upon,\nto him belong the most excellent names.’ ” Nonetheless, the equivalence that the Qur’an\nassumes between the terms allāh and al- raḥmān cannot have been novel, since a poem\nfrom the corpus of al- Aʿshā Maymūn speaks interchangeably of al- raḥmān and of Allāh\n(Ḥusayn 1983, no. 15:36–37; Sinai 2019b, 20 and 59).22\nThe emergence of the divine name al- raḥmān towards the end of the early Meccan\nperiod and the “raḥmān surahs.” In the Qur’an, the divine name al- raḥmān occurs most\noften and most prominently as part of the basmalah. However, the basmalah may well be\na secondary addition to at least some surahs (see u nder → ˻bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm).\nIf it is disregarded, the expression al- raḥmān is completely absent from a significant num-\nber of early Meccan compositions, which indicates that it did not initially form part of\nthe Qur’anic lexicon. Possibly the earliest occurrence of the name comes in the opening\nverse of the early Meccan Surah 55, aptly known as Sūrat al-R aḥmān (vv. 1–4): “The Mer-\nciful! // He has taught the recitation (al- qurʾān), // has created man, // has taught him\nclear exposition.” If, as argued elsewhere (→ mathānī), Q 15:87 is a retrospective allusion\nto the first surah of the Qur’an, the Fātiḥah, then Surah 1 w ill qualify as another early\nMeccan attestation of al- raḥmān, since the latter appears in Q 1:3.23 Surah 15 itself does\nnot make use of al-r aḥmān, but includes two verses with other derivatives of the root\nr- ḥ-m (Q 15:49.56), the first one of which, quoted above, promises to God’s “servants”\nthat the deity is “forgiving” (ghafūr) and “merciful” (raḥīm). Two more early occurrences\nof al- raḥmān are found in Q 26:5 (early Meccan) and 50:33 (somewhat later). Surah 26,\nmoreover, includes multiple instances of the refrain “YourS Lord is the mighty one, the\nmerciful one (al- raḥīm),” which generally concludes accounts of historical acts of divine\npunishment (vv. 9, 68, 104, 122, 140, 159, 175, 191; see also v. 217).\nJudging by their mean verse length, which can serve as a rough and ready indicator\nof the Meccan surahs’ relative chronology (HCI 113–124), the instances of al- raḥmān just\ncited straddle the transition from the early Meccan period to the later Meccan one: Surahs\n55, 26, and 15 have a mean verse length of 32.97, 36.71, and 43.12 transliteration letters, re-\nspectively, putting them at the upper end of the early Meccan texts, while Surah 50 (50.82\ntransliteration letters) has the lowest mean verse length after what is con ven iently definable\nas the numerical cut- of point for early Meccan surahs (see HCI 161).24 Approximately\naround the same time— namely, relatively soon after the transition to the later Meccan\nsurahs— Surah 76 (mean verse length: 52.65 transliteration letters), though devoid of the\n22 See also the discussion of the Jabal Dhabūb inscription under → ˻bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm as well as\nthat of God’s “most excellent names” under → ism.\n23 And also, of course, in Q 1:1, as part of the basmalah; but the basmalah may not be an integral part of\nthe Fātiḥah (GQ 1:116).\n24 The divine name al- raḥmān is also used in Q 78:38–39, in a surah whose mean verse length is below that\nof Surah 55; but these verses are part of a later insertion encompassing 78:37–40 (GQ 1:104; PP 455).\nal- raḥmān 343", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Both Surah 76 and\nSurah 38 thus reinforce the sense that by the close of the early Meccan period, divine mercy\nhas emerged as a topic of Qur’anic theological reflection, and that at this time impor tant\nfacets of the Qur’an’s conception of divine mercy— such as the association of mercy with\nforgiveness and its bestowal upon God’s “servants” (Q 15:49) and the duality of God’s\nmercy, on the one hand, and his stern justice t owards wrongdoers, on the other (Q 26:9.68\netc., 76:31)27— have come into view.\nA handful of subsequent compositions then employ the divine name al- raḥmān with\ncon spic u ous frequency. Foremost among them is Surah 19, with sixteen occurrences of\nal- raḥmān (vv. 18, 26, 44, 45, 58, 61, 69, 75, 78, 85, 87, 88, 91, 92, 93, 96) and several further\ninstances of the root r-ḥ - m (vv. 2, 21, 50, 53). Surah 19’s dual emphasis on divine mercy and\non the introduction of a novel female protagonist, Mary, has been underlined by Neuwirth\n(Neuwirth 2016c, 31–33) and may bear further study.28 Other Meccan texts punctuated by\nthe divine name al- raḥmān are Surah 20 (vv. 5, 90, 108, 109), Surah 21 (vv. 26, 36, 42, 112),\nSurah 25 (vv. 26, 59, 60, 63), Surah 36 (vv. 11, 15, 23, 52), Surah 43 (17, 19, 20, 33, 36, 45, 81),\nand Surah 67 (vv. 3, 19, 20, 29). Weil and Nöldeke place all of these texts in the so- called\n“ middle Meccan” phase (GQ 1:121), and t here is indeed reason to accept that all of them\nwere composed and promulgated during the same approximate period of time, given\nthat their mean verse length is concentrated between 55 and 75 transliteration letters.29 In\nfact, there are only a few surahs in this range that do not exhibit a repeated employment\nof the term al-r aḥmān— most importantly, Surah 23 (which does however have several\noccurrences of other derivatives of r-ḥ - m in vv. 75, 109, and 118) and Surah 72.30 There are\na few additional isolated occurrences of al- raḥmān in surahs with an even higher mean\nverse length (see Q 2:163, 13:30, 17:110, 27:30, 41:2, 59:22). But generally speaking, at some\ntime in the later Meccan period the divine name al- raḥmān appears to have faded out of\nQur’anic usage, at least outside the basmalah. This is not to overlook, of course, that even\nthereafter God’s mercy remained an impor tant Qur’anic topic, as illustrated by some of\nthe material quoted earlier in this entry.\n25 Cf. similarly Q 42:8 and also 48:25.\n26 For another early Meccan allusion to divine mercy, see Q 52:28, where God is called al- raḥīm. The context\nhas to do with God’s having protected the right eous ones, who w ere previously fearful of damnation, against the\npunishment of hell (Q 52:26–28).\n27 This duality is of course also enshrined in the Fātiḥah: God is merciful (Q 1:3); but he is also the “king\n(→ malik) of judgement day” (1:4), and the final verse evokes those who are subject to God’s wrath (al- maghḍūb\nʿalayhim; see also under → ghaḍiba), identified with those who go astray (al-ḍ āllīn).\n28 Neuwirth describes Surah 19 as “the first Raḥmān- Sura, i.e. a text that throughout uses al-R aḥmān”\n(Neuwirth 2016c, 32). But the question of the precise diachronic relationship between Surah 19, on the one hand,\nand Surahs 20, 21, 25, 36, 43, and 67, on the other, cannot be regarded as settled.\n29 Surahs 19, 20, 21, 25, 36, 43, and 67 have a mean verse length of 62.42, 61.04, 67.08, 75.25, 55.01, 61.78,\nand 67.47 transliteration letters, respectively.\n30 Strictly speaking, the surahs in question are Q 23, 72, 73, and 98. However, Surah 73 has a much lower mean\nverse length if the l ater addition Q 73:20 is excluded from the computation. Surah 98, meanwhile, is anomalous\nin other regards as well (HCI 130–131).\n344 al- raḥmān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Do t hese surahs,\nfor example, share certain distinctive theological preoccupations? Angelika Neuwirth\nhas provisionally discerned a focus on a “particularly intimate relationship between God\nand the believers” in them (Neuwirth 2016c, 33), an impor tant hypothesis that merits\nbeing explored further. Another issue in need of more research arises from the fact that\nthe subgroup of raḥmān surahs just adumbrated are by no means devoid of the divine\nnames allāh (e.g., Q 19:30.35.36.48.49.58.76.81 and 43:63.64.87) and rabb + possessive suffix\n(e.g., Q 19:2.3.4.6.8.9.10.19.21 e tc. and 43:13.14.32.35.46 e tc.).31 This observation entails the\nquestion whether the concurrent use of t hese three divine names obeys any perceptible\npatterns. Rabb + suffix, of course, lends itself to use in petitions or direct addresses (e.g.,\nQ 19:3.4.6.8.9.10). But the alternation between al- raḥmān and allāh in par tic u lar requires\ncloser analy sis. For instance, why does Q 19:58 employ both al- raḥmān and allāh, in dif-\nfer ent segments of the verse?\nAl- raḥmān as a proper name. It is common to find translations of the basmalah along\nthe lines of “In the name of the merciful and compassionate God” (e.g., Jones 2007). Yet\nthe Qur’an does not normally use raḥmān as an adjective (Jomier 1957, 362–363), despite the\nfact that there are of course many Arabic adjectives formed on the morphological pattern\nfaʿlān (Wright 1974, 1:136, 184, 241). The case for a nominal understanding of raḥmān is\nsuccinctly made in Graham 2001, 209 (see already van Ess 1975, 158–159): even outside the\nbasmalah, the term raḥmān never occurs without the definite article and is generally best\nconstrued as meaning “the Merciful,” in contrast with its adjectival cognate raḥīm, which\nappears both with and without the article (e.g., Q 2:173: inna llāha ghafūrun raḥīm, “God\nis forgiving and merciful”; 46:8: wa- huwa l- ghafūru l- raḥīm, “he is the one who is forgiv-\ning and merciful”). This analy sis has the additional advantage of according with the use of\nraḥmana and raḥmānān as a divine name (“the Merciful”) in Jewish Aramaic and Epigraphic\nSouth Arabian. Thus, Qur’anic usage and extra- Qur’anic comparative evidence indicate\nconcurrently that the primary diference between raḥmān and raḥīm is a distinction of\ngrammatical category, between noun and adjective.32 Al- raḥmān is not, therefore, a divine\nattribute but rather a proper name for God. This supports a rendering of the basmalah that\ntreats al- raḥmān as a second noun standing in apposition to allāh, with raḥīm functioning\nas an attribute of al- raḥmān.33 That the latter is a proper name is also illustrated by verses in\nwhich God is called al- raḥmān without God’s mercy being contextually in focus (Reynolds\n2020, 95). Pertinent examples are Q 19:45, where Abraham voices his fear that his idola-\ntrous father might sufer “a punishment from al- raḥmān,” and 36:23, which stresses that\nno one’s intercession w ill be of any avail “if al- raḥmān intends something harmful for me”\n(in yuridni l-r aḥmānu bi-ḍ urrin). On the other hand, we saw above that vario us Qur’anic\nlexemes derived from the root r-ḥ - m semantically revolve around the notions of mercy and\n31 According to Neuwirth, during the raḥmān period the divine name al- raḥmān “was in almost exclusive\nuse” (Neuwirth 2016c, 33), but this is an overstatement. Cf. also the more cautious wording in GQ 1:121: al- raḥmān\nis “occasionally more frequent than the usual allāh.”\n32 On the question whether the two words might also have a subtly dif er ent semantic content, see below.\n33 Nonetheless, if one limits oneself to considering the basmalah in isolation from the remainder of the\nQur’an, it is grammatically pos si ble to construe al- raḥmān as playing an adjectival function. To be sure, there is\nno support for such an adjectival usage of the word anywhere else in the Qur’an; but one could argue that the\npoint of the basmalah is precisely to demote the term from a noun to an adjective (Böwering 2002, 318, building\non van Ess 1975, 159–160).\nal- raḥmān 345", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Together with the fact that many Qur’anic verses do explic itly stress God’s\nmercy, this makes it likely that the proper name al- raḥmān would have conveyed some\nconnotation of divine mercy even in contexts that foreground the punitive aspects of God’s\ninteraction with h umans. It is, accordingly, appropriate to render name al- raḥmān as “the\nMerciful” rather than leaving it untranslated (“the raḥmān”).\nAre raḥmān and raḥīm synonymous? The relationship between the terms raḥmān and\nraḥīm as concatenated in the basmalah may also be examined from the perspective of their\nsemantic relationship rather than that of grammatical categories. Do the two terms, by virtue\nof their shared derivation from the consonantal root r-ḥ - m connoting mercy, convey the\nsame semantic content? The question has occasioned much comment in Islamic exegesis\n(see also Mir 2016, 46–47). Some scholars opt in favour of synonymity. For example, the\nearly commentator Abū ʿUbaydah suggests that the use of raḥīm is a rhetorically deliberate\ncase of pleonasm (li- ttisāʿi l- kalām), a device illustrated by vario us examples from ordinary\nArabic speech and poetry (Abū ʿUbaydah 1955–1962, 1:21; al- Thaʿlabī 2015, 2:298–299). An\nopposing view assumes that divine speech cannot contain semantically redundant repetition\n(takrār) and accordingly posits subtle semantic diferences between the two terms, e.g.,\nby maintaining that the former term expresses God’s mercy with regard to all of creation\nwhereas the latter term expresses God’s mercy specifically with regard to humanity (Ṭab.\n1:125–130; al- Thaʿlabī 2015, 2:300–312; SQ 6–7). Many of t hese distinctions are patently ret-\nrospective constructs that have l ittle support in the Qur’anic text, even if placing the word\nraḥmān against the background of classical Arabic morphology does allow one to credit it\nwith a hyperbolic connotation that raḥīm lacks (Zam. 1:108–109).34 Also pertinent is the\nobservation, made for instance by al-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī, that raḥmān can only be predicated\nof God while raḥīm may also be applied to other beings, an observation that he corroborates\nby adducing Q 9:128, where raḥīm is used to characterise the Prophet (al-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī\n2009, 347). That al- raḥmān should be reserved for the deity, of course, is explicable by the\nterm’s origin in an ancient Aramaic and Epigraphic South Arabian divine name. As we saw\nabove, the main distinction between raḥmān and raḥīm, as far as it can be delineated based\non Qur’anic data, is ultimately that al- raḥmān is a noun functioning in many re spects like\na proper name whereas raḥīm is its cognate adjective. In line with this, raḥīm can appear\nas part of the twin divine predications that often conclude Qur’anic verses (e.g., Q 2:143:\ninna llāha bi- l- nāsi la- raʾūfun raḥīm; 2:182: inna llāha ghafūrun raḥīm; 4:16: inna llāha kāna\ntawwāban raḥīmā). Q 9:128, reflecting the Medinan surahs’ elevation of Muhammad’s status,\nexceptionally applies this predicatory convention to the Qur’anic Prophet (Marshall 1999,\n164–175; HCI 206–207). Th ere is no reason to suppose that raḥīm h ere means anything\nother than the adjective “merciful.”\nAs regards the collocation al- raḥmān + al- raḥīm, it is relatively rare outside the basmalah\nand only occurs in Q 1:3, 2:163, 41:2, and 59:22, in addition to 27:30, which has the full\nbasmalah formula (see u nder → bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm). In all t hese cases, raḥīm\noccupies a verse-fi nal position. Hence, the primary function of raḥīm when coupled with\nal- raḥmān would appear to be to permit verse-fi nal use of the latter term in a context rhyming\nin ī/ū + m/n rather than to convey a special semantic nuance that is not already expressed by\n34 However, the contention that the morphological pattern faʿlān can simply be equivalent to faʿīl may\nbe supported by citing a line of early Arabic poetry that employs nadmān in lieu of nadīm, “boon companion”\n(EAP 1:113–114).\n346 al- raḥmān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Nonetheless, there\nare a few cases where razaqa and rizq refer to human, rather than divine, support of\nsocially vulnerable persons, such as divorced mothers or orphans (Q 2:233, 4:5.8).1 This\napplication of razaqa and rizq to inter- human maintenance arrangements may be a ves-\ntige of its pre- Islamic usage as attested by early poetry (DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 8:3; Zuhayr,\nno. 14:36; Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 55:14; see also Arazi and Masalha 1999, 514).2 Such a non-\ntheological use of rizq and the verb razaqa also accords with the etymological fact that\nthey are ultimately descended from Middle Persian rōzīg, “daily ration, daily bread.” The\nword prob ably entered Arabic via Syriac rūzīqā (FVQ 142–143; Ciancaglini 2008, 255;\nMacKenzie 1971, 72; TS 3847; SL 1445), although it also exists in Jewish Aramaic (DJBA\n1063–1064). Overall, it is not inapt to compare Qur’anic rizq to the “daily bread” requested\nin the Lord’s Prayer (Matt 6:11).3\n35 Cf. the suggestion in Mir 2016, 46, that on one reading of al- raḥmān al- raḥīm, the function of raḥīm would\nbe comparable to that of “pitch” in “pitch dark.” My discussion should also be compared with Blankinship 2020,\n103–104, who maintains that al- raḥmān “is stronger or wider than al- raḥīm in meaning” and concludes that an\nadequate En glish rendering of the phrase is impossible.\n1 Other terms that exhibit a similar mundane- theological double use are → ajal and → ajr.\n2 Medieval scholars raised doubts about the authenticity of Ṭarafah no. 8; see DSAAP, 111 (Latin pagination).\n3 “Our daily bread” is laḥmā d- sūnqānan in Syriac (“the bread we need”), i.e., does not involve a cognate\nof Qur’anic rizq.\nrazaqa 347", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

While I have been unable\nto locate a religious use of Syriac rūzīqā, the Arabic noun rizq figures in a theological\ncontext in a verse from the poetic corpus of al- Aʿshā Maymūn (Ḥusayn 1983, no. 34:35),\nwhich boasts of the “inexhaustible provision” that God has granted the poet’s tribe. A\nverse from the dīwān of the Christian ʿAdī ibn Zayd describes God with the participle qāʾit,\n“sustainer, nourisher” (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 6:47; cf. the use of q-w -t at Q 41:10).4 God\nas the munificent provider of humans and of creation as a whole is also a Biblical theme,\nexpressed in Hebrew by derivatives of the root ś-b - ʿ connoting satiety and satisfaction\n(NIDOTTE 3:1209–1214). For instance, God is the one who gives the wandering Israel-\nites “meat to eat in the eve ning and your fill of bread in the morning (wəleḥem babbōqer\nliśbōaʿ)” (Exod 16:8), and it is God who sees to it that the earth, the trees, and animate\ncreatures are all “sated” (Ps 104:13.16.28: tiśbaʿ, yiśbəʿū, yiśbəʿūn) and who “gives” the latter\n“their food in due season” (Ps 104:27).5 The theme of the generous sustenance that God\ngrants his animate creatures is also developed in considerable detail by Jacob of Sarug\n(Mathews 2020, 26–31, ll. 1989–2026).6 Quite possibly, Arabic rizq and razaqa, apart from\ndesignating support granted by one human to another, at some point came to function\nas a lexical vehicle for this Biblical trope in the language of pre- Qur’anic Jews and/or\nChristians— just as ʿAdī ibn Zayd appears to have had recourse to qāta (“to nourish, to\nsustain”) instead of razaqa. This conjecture fits well with a petition for divine provision\nin a late Sabaic inscription that is possibly pre- Qur’anic (Al- Jallad, forthcoming, revising\nthe reading proposed in al- Ḥājj and Faqʿas 2018). According to Al- Jallad’s re- reading, the\ntext opens with the words “In the name of God, the Merciful” (b-s 1mlh rḥmn; → ˻bi-s mi\nllāhi l-r aḥmāni l-r aḥīm), pleads for God’s mercy, and then entreats the deity to “grant\nus provision from your favour” (rzqn m-f ḍlk, corresponding to Arabic urzuqnā min\nfaḍlik a).7 Al- Jallad links this supplication with Ps 90:14 (“Satisfy us in the morning with\nyour mercy,” śabbəʿēnū babbōqer ḥasdekā).\nDivine provision in the Qur’an. As already noted, in the Islamic scripture it is the\ntheological usage of r- z- q that is the prevalent one. The Qur’an is adamant that God is “the\nbest provider” (khayr al- rāziqīn; Q 5:114, 22:58, 23:72, 34:39, 62:11) and identifies him as\nthe primary originator of all h uman and animal sustenance (Q 11:6): “t here is no creature\non earth whose sustenance does not depend on God.” God allocates ample provision “to\nwhom he wills” (yabsuṭu l- rizqa li- man yashāʾu) while to others he gives only sparingly\n(wa- yaqdiru, on which see CDKA 220; Q 13:26, 17:30, 28:82, 29:62, 30:37, 34:36.39, 39:52,\n42:12; see also 16:71). Divine provision is both this- worldly (e.g., Q 2:172: “O believers,\neat of the good things that we have provided for you and be grateful to God”; see also\n5:88, 6:142, 7:160 etc.) and eschatological (e.g., Q 2:25, on which see u nder → jannah,\nand 3:169, 22:58, or 40:40), and it is bestowed not only upon h umans but also on animals\n(Q 11:6, 29:60). Qur’anic evocations of God’s provision frequently appear together with\n4 I am grateful to Nadja Abuhussein for alerting me to the verse by ʿAdī ibn Zayd.\n5 I owe these Biblical references to NIDOTTE 3:1211.

This stance\nis subsequently toned down in the Medinan surahs, which embrace a limited number of\ndietary taboos, such as the prohibition of pork, carrion, and blood (e.g., Q 2:173 and 5:3; see\nmore generally Sinai 2019c).

Qur’anic occurrences of rasūl number over three hundred and\nrange from the early Meccan period (see Q 15:11, 26:16.27.107.125.143.162.178, 44:13.17–18,\n51:52, 69:10,1 and 91:13) to the Medinan one (e.g., Q 2:87.101.108 e tc., 3:32.49). Much less\nfrequently, some thirty times, the passive participle mursal, “somebody sent” (from ar-\nsala, “to send s.o.”), is employed as a synonym (Q 2:252, 6:34.48, 7:6.75.77, 13:43, 15:80,\n26:21.105.123.141.160.176 and elsewhere; see O’Connor 2019, 184–185).2 Where the Qur’an\nuses the term rasūl in the definite state—a l-r asūl, “the Messenger”—or as a part of the\nconstruct rasūl allāh, “God’s Messenger,” reference is generally to Muhammad, who is\nexplic itly identified as “God’s Messenger” in Q 33:40 and 48:29 (see also 3:144), even if\nboth expressions are on occasion also used for e arlier messengers, such as Moses and Jesus\n(e.g., Q 3:53, 4:171, 61:5.6, 73:16, or 91:13).\nAccording to the premodern lexicographic tradition, rasūl was originally a verbal noun\nlike qabūl and a synonym of risālah, “message,” and subsequently came to designate the\nbearer of a message (AEL 1083, 1084; Wright 1974, 1:136). If this is indeed what happened,\nthe development must predate the Qur’an, since rasūl = “messenger” is attested in early po-\netry: ʿAlqamah bemoans that his love afair has ended due to the “signs of [= the t hings said\nby?] the deceiving messenger” (āyāt al- rasūl al- mukhabbib; DSAAP, ʿAlqamah, no. 1:12).3\nMoreover, the word rs1l appears in an inscription by the South Arabian king Abraha from\n548 CE (CIH, no. 541, ll. 90–91), where it refers to Lakhmid and Ghassanid ambassadors\n(Beeston et al. 1982, 117; Robin 2015a, 166),4 recalling Q 12:50. The Sabaic word is borrowed\nfrom Arabic rasūl (Beeston 1994, 43).\nHuman messengership in the Meccan surahs. A Qur’anic rasūl or mursal is a h uman\nwho has been dispatched by God and charged with “reciting” (talā; see u nder → qaraʾa) or\n“recounting” (qaṣșa) God’s “signs” (Q 6:130, 7:35, 28:59, 39:71; → āyah) and with conveying\nwarnings (andhara) and glad tidings (verb: → bashshara), namely, of eschatological punish-\nment and reward (Q 4:165, 5:19, 6:130, 25:7, 39:71, 46:9). The Meccan proclamations include\nmore or less detailed narratives about a certain number of par tic ul ar messengers prior to\nMuhammad (see in general Marshall 1999), such as Noah (called a rasūl in Q 26:107; see also\n25:37), Moses (called a rasūl in Q 20:47, 26:16.27, 43:46, 44:17.18, and 73:15.16, sometimes\ntogether with his b rother Aaron), or Ṣāliḥ, sent to Thamūd (called a rasūl in Q 26:143 and\n91:13). In addition, it is repeatedly made clear in the Meccan surahs that God sees to it that\nevery “community” (→ ummah) receives its own messenger (Q 10:47, 16:36, 23:44, 40:5;\nWensinck 1924, 172; Ahrens 1935, 129; Bijlefeld 1969, 19–20; see also Q 17:15 and 28:59) and\n“warner” (Q 26:208 and 35:24), who w ill also function as God’s prosecutorial “witness”\n(shahīd) at the final judgement (Q 16:84.89, 28:75; 73:15 has shāhid; cf. the Medinan parallel\n4:41).

Muhammad is explic itly presented as conforming to\nthis nativist pattern: he is charged to “warn the mother-t own and those dwelling around\nit” (Q 6:92, 42:7: li- tundhira umma l- qurā wa- man ḥawlahā),5 his revelatory proclama-\ntions are in Arabic rather than in a foreign tongue (e.g., Q 12:2, 16:103, 41:44, 43:3; see\nunder → ʿarabī), and he is “from” his addressees (Q 16:89). Especially the Meccan Qur’an\ntherefore envisages h uman messengership in the ser vice of God as a universal historical\nphenomenon that has a range of discrete localised manifestations.\nMuhammad’s messengership in the Medinan Qur’an. Medinan surahs retain aspects\nof the above theology of messengership, e.g., by reasserting a messenger’s responsibility\nfor “reciting” or “bringing” (jāʾa bi- ) God’s signs (Q 2:129.151, 3:49.164, 62:2, 65:11), by\nstressing Muhammad’s origin from among his addressees (Q 2:129.151, 3:164, 9:128, 62:2)\nand by repeating the princip le that he is the divinely appointed “witness” (shahīd) of his\ncommunity (→ ummah; Q 4:41).6 A plurality of past messengers, some of whom are not\nmentioned in the Qur’anic revelations, continues to be presupposed (Q 4:164, closely\nresembling 40:78). At the same time, t here is an almost complete disappearance of ref-\nerences to God’s destruction of previous communities who rejected their messengers\n(KU 25–26; Marshall 1999, 157–164). In addition, Medinan texts exhibit a novel tendency\nto universalise the scope of Muhammad’s ministry, casting him as God’s messenger or\nprophet to “the scriptureless” (al- ummiyyūn) in general and in some cases extending his\nremit to the “scripture- owners” as well (Q 3:20, 5:15.19; see in more detail under → ummī\nand → al-ʿ ālamūn).\nA distinct feature of Medinan phraseology is Muhammad’s promotion to the Messenger\npar excellence, referred to as al- rasūl (“the Messenger”) or rasūl allāh (“God’s Messenger”).7\nSpecifically Medinan too are recurrent bipartite references to “God and his Messenger”\n(e.g., Q 2:279, 4:13.14.100.136, 5:33.55.56, 8:1.13.20.46, 9:1.3.24.29.59.62.63.65.71.74.80.84.9\n0.91.94.105.107). They induce a phraseological proximity of God and Muhammad that has\naptly been described as a “Godward movement” of the latter (Marshall 1999, 164–175). It\nis noteworthy that the phrase “God and his Messenger” is extremely frequent in Surah 9,\nprob ably one of the latest Medinan texts,8 while occurring only once in Surah 2 (v. 279). This\n5 The traditional equation of umm al- qurā with the settlement in which the Meccan Messenger is active,\nand which based on other verses can be inferred to be Mecca (HCI 49), is sound. For another verse using umm\nin the sense of a metropolitan town surrounded by other settlements, see Q 28:59, where the state of afairs\nintimated in 6:92 and 42:7 is generalised: “YourS Lord did not destroy any of the settlements u ntil having sent\nto their mother- town a messenger who would recount our signs to them (wa- mā kāna rabbuka muhlika l- qurā\nḥattā yabʿatha fī ummihā rasūlan yatlū ʿalayhim āyātinā); and we did not destroy any of the settlements unless\nits inhabitants were wrongdoers.”\n6 In Q 2:143 and 22:78, the word shahīd seems to have a dif er ent significance; see under → al-ʿ ālamūn.\n7 This is anticipated in the Meccan verses Q 25:27.30, where al- rasūl is plausibly identified with Muhammad,\ngiven that the latter verse has “the messenger” complain that his p eople have shunned “this qurʾān.” Both verses\nwould seem to pick up from the reference to “this messenger” (hādhā l- rasūl) in v. 7. By contrast, in Q 29:18\n(“The only t hing incumbent upon the messenger is to transmit clearly,” wa- mā ʿalā l- rasūli illā l- balāghu l- mubīn),\nal- rasūl must be construed generically (“the messenger” = “messengers in general”), since the statement occurs\nin a speech attributed to Abraham.\n8 In support of this assessment, note that Q 9:28 reserves access to the sanctuary exclusively to the believers\nwhile banning the associators (see in more detail under → ṭahara and → ʿamara).

The most remarkable manifestation of the Messenger’s\nproximity to God comes in the penultimate verse of Surah 9 (Q 9:128), which applies to the\nMessenger two attributes, kindness and mercy (on which see u nder → al- raḥmān), that are\nother wise (e.g., Q 2:143) reserved for the deity (KK 216) and thereby implies the Messenger’s\n“participation in divine characteristics” (Marshall 1999, 170–173).\nAntecedents of the Qur’anic concept of human messengership. The Qur’an’s pre-\ndominant usage of rasūl for a human envoy dispatched by God has been connected to\nthe New Testamental notion of apostleship, given that rasūl forms a literal counterpart of\nGreek apostolos and Syriac shlīḥā (Wensinck 1924, 173–174; QP 110; for a nuanced evalu-\nation, see O’Connor 2019, 186–196; an exemplary New Testamental occurrence is Matt\n10:2). The Qur’anic phrase rasūl allāh— used for a pre de ces sor of Muhammad as early as\nQ 91:13 and very common in the Medinan surahs—h as an exact parallel in Syriac shlīḥā/\nshlīḥeh d- allāhā, occurring in the Syriac Acts of Thomas (Wensinck 1924, 174, and Fossum\n1993, 152; see Wright 1871, 1:178, l. 16, 1:207, l. 1, and 1:264, l. 13, translated in 2:152.179.229)\nand in the History of Philip (Wright 1871, 1:94, l. 10, 1:96, l. 18, translated in 2:88.90). As\nWensinck highlights, the Apostle Thomas preaches to the people of India just as a Qur’anic\nmessenger preaches to his assigned audience. This should not lead one to overlook impor-\ntant diferences between Qur’anic messengership and Christian apostleship, however.\nMost conspicuously, the disciples of Jesus are Qur’anically labelled al- ḥawāriyyūn (Q 3:52,\n5:111–112, 61:14), from Classical Ethiopic ḥawārәyān (singular: ḥawārәyā; NB 48 and FVQ\n115–116), and are never called rusul (Widengren 1955, 15; Bijlefeld 1969, 12, n. 54; Fossum\n1993, 151). From a Qur’anic perspective, the title rasūl applies to Jesus himself rather than\nto his disciples (see Q 2:87, 3:53, 4:157.171, 57:27, 61:6). Of course, the Qur’an also applies\nthe title of rasūl to much e arlier figures such as Noah or Moses. This has been compared\nto Origen, Procopius, and Chrysostom, who widen the New Testamental notion of apos-\ntleship beyond the disciples of Jesus, extending it to Moses, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and John the\nBaptist (Wensinck 1924, 173–174).\nDespite the preceding, it cannot be taken for granted that the Qur’anic use of rasūl\nmust have a specifically Christian background. Thus, a late antique Jewish liturgical poem\nin Palestinian Aramaic, recovered from the Cairo Genizah, has Moses self- identify as\nGod’s “messenger” (Rodrigues Pereira 1997, 315–316 and 398–400, pointed out in\nO’Connor 2019, 187; see also DJPA 553). A Samaritan text known as Memar Marqah or\nTibat Marqe similarly calls Moses God’s “messenger” and refers to his “messengership”\n(Fossum 1985b, 145–146; see also Fossum 1993, 151–152, citing Macdonald 1963, 1:123 and\n2:201 = Memar Marqah 5:3, although this particular section of the work may not be\npre-Islamic). In both cases, application of the title to Moses may have arisen from Exod\n3:13 and 4:28, which speak of God’s “sending” of Moses (Widengren 1950, 47).

Similar to the Qur’an, some\nManichaean texts include Adam, Noah, and Jesus among the messengers prior to Mani\n(Stroumsa 1986, 71; Tardieu 2008, 15; Fossum 1993, 157).10\nIn sum, while the precise filiation of the Qur’anic universalisation of the notion of mes-\nsengership is difficult to discern, it does intersect with vari ous late antique trajectories.\nAt the same time, it is clear that such pre- existing trends are modified in accordance with\nQur’anic doctrine. This is exemplified by the fact that the Qur’an, contradicting Christian\nusage, excludes the disciples of Jesus from the category of messengership. Specifically, this\nreclassification of the disciples may be viewed as a consequence of the Qur’an’s demotion of\nJesus from a divine figure to the status of a mere messenger, which may then have entailed\na knock-on demotion of Jesus’s disciples from the status of apostles or messengers to mere\nḥawāriyyūn and “helpers” (anṣār; Q 3:52, 61:14).\nRasūl and mursal referring to angelic messengers. Although the Qur’an principally\napplies the terms rasūl and mursal to humans, they can also be applied to angels (DTEK\n83–84; Hawting 2011, 385; O’Connor 2019, 185). Thus, rasūl refers to an angelic messenger\nin Q 19:19, 42:51, and 81:19,11 and the plural rusul occurs in the same capacity in Q 6:61,\n7:37, 10:21, 11:69.77.81, 22:75, 29:31.33, 35:1, 43:80, and prob ably also 2:98.12 Of course, the\nArabic term rasūl may be viewed as an equivalent not only of Greek apostolos but also of\nGreek angelos, “messenger, envoy,” which by virtue of becoming increasingly confined to\nsuper natural messengers ultimately turned into Latin angelus or En glish “angel.” None-\ntheless, the Qur’anic term for an angel in the conventional sense— i.e., for a super natural\nintermediary between God and humans— is → malak, and even though malak and rasūl\ncan be referentially equivalent in certain Qur’anic verses they are never proper synonyms:\nrasūl designates a being carry ing out a certain function, that of an “emissary” or perhaps\nalso of an “authorised agent” more generally (see DTEK 83–84), while malak designates\nan angel in the sense of a certain kind of super natural being.13 The overlap arises b ecause\nthe latter can act as the former, as the Qur’an itself makes explicit: God has appointed “an-\ngels (al- malāʾikah) as messengers (rusulan),” Q 35:1 says, and according to Q 22:75 “God\nchooses messengers from the angels and from humans” (allāhu yaṣṭafī mina l-m alāʾikati\nrusulan wa-m ina l-n āsi).\nThe Qur’an’s concurrent use of malak and rasūl with the meanings just outlined is\nprob ably not novel. Successive verses of a poem credited to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt refer\nto God’s angels both as malāʾik and as rusul (Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:32–33 = al- Saṭlī 1974,\nno. 10:32–33; cf. Seidensticker 2011b, 47–49). The same distinction between the terms\nmalak (designating a super natural intermediary between God and humans) and rasūl\n(meaning “messenger” in general) is one that also seems to have been observed by Muham-\nmad’s pagan opponents, the “associators” (→ ashraka), at least in so far as the utterances\nattributed to them employ both words (e.g., Q 25:7). It would therefore seem that Qur’anic\nusage is here in line with established Arabic usage more generally.\n10 See also QP 300–304, pointing to the similarity between the Qur’anic chain of prophets or messengers\nand those recognised by vari ous strands of Jewish Chris tian ity.\n11 On Q 81:19, see the discussion under → malak.\n12 For mursalūn in the sense of angelic messengers, see Q 15:57.61. For contrasting cases in which the plural\nrusul clearly means human messengers, see Q 7:43.53, 11:59, or 23:44.\n13 One might compare the sense in which b. Taʿan. 2a uses Hebrew shaliaḥ to refer to an intermediary by\nmeans of whom God executes his will.\nrasūl, mursal 353", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Especially in ter est ing are two verses credited to Imruʾ al- Qays and\nʿAbīd ibn al- Abraṣ (the latter of which is edited and translated as no. 24:21 in Lyall 1913)\nthat oppose rūḥ, “spirit,” and jasad, “body” (Seidensticker 1989, 152–153, including a\nconvincing critique of Lyall’s rendering). In the Qur’an, too, the word rūḥ (for general\ndiscussions of which see O’Shaughnessy 1953 and Durie 2018, 164–175) is generally trans-\nlatable as “spirit,” though the spirit in question is, as we shall see, never that of a human\nindividual. There is, accordingly, an arresting discontinuity between the poetic use of\nthe noun rūḥ and the Qur’an, where it is only the → nafs that departs the human body\nat death (Seidensticker 1989, 141–142).2 In fact, the meaning of rūḥ in Qur’anic Arabic,\nrather than continuing pre- Qur’anic poetic usage, would seem to exhibit a strong seman-\ntic imprint of its Syriac cognate rūḥā (SL 1445–1446), and it has aptly been said that the\nterm rūḥ reached the Qur’anic milieu as a “theological terminus technicus” (Macdonald\n1932, 30). Parenthetically, one may add that this makes “spirit” a particularly fitting En glish\ntranslation of Qur’anic rūḥ, given the Latin origin of “spirit.”3\nQur’anic instances of the noun rūḥ convey what would at first sight seem to be two\nrather dif er ent conceptions, discussed u nder (i) and (ii) below: a personal or agentive one,\nrepresenting the rūḥ as a quasi-a ngelic figure who functions as a representative of God, and\nan impersonal one, representing the rūḥ as a vivifying or fortifying princip le originating\nfrom or bestowed by God (see, e.g., DTEK 123–124). The contrast between both uses runs\nlargely parallel to a grammatical distinction, namely, whether the noun rūḥ functions as a\ngrammatical subject, as in most verses allocated to group (i), or as a direct or prepositional\ngrammatical object, as in group (ii), the grammatical subject at hand being God himself.\nThis parallelism is, however, not complete, and some passages in which the spirit figures\nas an object of divine action are at least reconcilable with an agentive interpretation. Most\nof these passages are presented as a separate category (iii) below.\n(i) The spirit as a quasi- angelic intermediary or agent of God. Two Meccan passages\nspeak of “the spirit” as an intermediary figure who “brings down” (nazala bi- or → naz-\nzala + acc.) divine revelations to Muhammad (Q 26:192–195 and 16:102) and is given the\nepithets “trustworthy” and “holy” (Q 26:193: al-r ūḥ al-a mīn; 16:102: rūḥ al-q udus; see\n2 As the data compiled by Seidensticker show, both the ḥadīth corpus and Umayyad poetry use rūḥ to mean\nthe individual human spirit (Seidensticker 1989, 142–151), thus resuming what appears to have been the word’s\npre- Qur’anic meaning.\n3 Durie questions a general policy of translating Qur’anic rūḥ as “spirit,” and at one point suggests that\nQur’anic statements according to which God “blew” (nafakha) “some of his spirit” (min + rūḥ + possessive suffix)\ninto Adam or Mary are best translated simply as “to blow into” (Durie 2018, 174–175; see also 171–172). Durie’s\nrationale is that Qur’anic occurrences of rūḥ, while constituting “reflexes of Biblical materials,” exhibit “a loss\nof theological content”; as he puts it slightly earlier, there is “no Qurʾanic Theology of rūḥ as the breath of life”\n(Durie 2018, 174–175). Yet however limited the number of Qur’anic verses speaking of God’s rūḥ are in compari-\nson with other topics, it does seem very likely that in the kind of Arabic spoken in the Qur’anic milieu the word\nrūḥ had become the standard term for conveying Biblical and Christian notions about God’s spirit.

The expression “the holy spirit” in Q 16:102 reflects the\nChristian theme that it is the “Holy Spirit” (to pneuma to hagion; Syriac rūḥā d-q ūdshā)\nwho “speaks through the prophets” (to lalēsan dia tōn prophētōn), as codified in the\nNicene Creed (PP 101), against the background of pertinent Biblical statements (e.g.,\n2 Sam 23:2; Acts 1:16, 4:8, 28:25; 2 Pet 1:21).4 That the expression rūḥ al-q udus would\nhave had a Christian assonance is confirmed by a South Arabian inscription from 548\nCE. Commissioned by the Ḥimyarite ruler Abraha, it opens with an invocation of the\nChristian Trinity in which the Holy Spirit is designated by an expression that is cognate\nwith the Qur’anic rūḥ al-q udus, namely, rḥ qds1 (Sima 2004, 25 and 28; Robin and Ri-\njziger 2018, 281). By contrast, an inscription by a pre de ces sor of Abraha from less than\ntwo de cades earlier employs mnfs1 qds1, loaned from Classical Ethiopic manfas qәddūs\n(Robin 2015a, 153).5\nThree further passages exhibiting a personal or agentive understanding of the spirit\nare the early Meccan verses Q 70:4, 78:38, and 97:4. Each of them specifies some action\nthat is jointly ascribed to the spirit and the angels, and thereby implies that the spirit\nbears substantial affinity with the latter. For instance, Q 78:38 prophesies that on the day\nof judgement “the spirit and the angels” will “stand in ranks” (yawma yaqūmu l- rūḥu wa-\nl- malāʾikatu ṣaffan). The other two verses have “the angels and the spirit” move up and\ndown between heaven and earth, and associate this movement with an extended or even\nstupendous period of time (see PP 438–439). Thus, Q 97:4 says that the angels and the\nspirit “descend” (tanazzalu) during the mysterious “night of foreordainment” (laylat al-\nqadr; see in more detail u nder → amr), which according to the preceding verse is “better\nthan a thousand months” (Q 97:3), and Q 70:4 (on which see also PP 438–439) maintains\nthat the angels and the spirit “ascend” (taʿruju) back to God “on a day whose length is\n50,000 years,” presumably in order to underscore that the vast cosmic distances covered\nare beyond the scope of human comprehension.6\nA final passage exhibiting an agentive understanding of the spirit is Q 19:17. The verse\nrecounts that God “sent” his spirit to Mary, upon which the spirit “appeared to her as a\nshapely h uman” (fa- arsalnā ilayhā rūḥanā fa- tamaththala lahā basharan sawiyyā). This is\nfollowed by a dialogue between Mary and the spirit (vv. 18–21), who says that he has been\nsent in order to “give” Mary a “pure boy” (v. 19: li- ahaba laki ghulāman zakiyyā).7 Mary\nthen falls pregnant with Jesus (v. 22: fa-ḥ amalathu). The scene evidently harks back, in\nsome form, to the encounter between Mary and the angel Gabriel that is narrated in Luke\n1:26–38, where Gabriel announces to Mary that “you w ill conceive in your womb and bear\na son” (Luke 1:31) and, shortly afterwards, that “the Holy Spirit w ill come upon you, and\nthe power of the Most High will overshadow you” (Luke 1:35), even if Luke, unlike Surah\n19, keeps apart the announcer of Mary’s pregnancy (Gabriel) from the agent causing it (the\n4 On the evident etymological link between rūḥ al- qudus and Syriac rūḥā d- qūdshā, see already Macdonald\n1932, 28; CQ 29; FVQ 232; Durie 2018, 168.\n5 The Christian connotations of the phrase rūḥ al- qudus also emerge from three Medinan verses, discussed\nunder category (ii), according to which God “fortified” (ayyada) Jesus with the “holy spirit” (Q 2:87.253, 5:110).\n6 O’Shaughnessy 1953, 18, quotes two passages from Ephrem that he considers to form parallels to t hese three\nQur’anic verses, but none of them c ouples “the angels and the spirit” in exactly the same manner as the Qur’an.\n7 A significant number of variant readings have li- yahaba instead of li- ahaba for Q 9:17, thus piously dilut-\ning the fact that what is presumably the original wording of the text pre sents God’s spirit as the agent of Mary’s\nimpregnation.

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:379", "title": "Page 379", "locator": "pdf_page:379", "text": "Holy Spirit).8 Despite the fact that Q 19:17 positions the spirit as the grammatical object of\nGod’s sending (cf. Luke 1:26: Gabriel “was sent,” apestalē), God’s spirit is clearly an agent\nin his own right in this Qur’anic account, as indicated by the fact that rūḥanā (“our spirit”)\nforms the anaphorically implied subject of the verbs tamaththala, to “appear” (v. 17), qāla,\n“to say” (vv. 19, 21), and wahaba, “to give” (v. 19).\n(ii) The spirit as a vivifying or fortifying princip le emanating from God. In other\nQur’anic passages, by contrast, the “spirit” is more closely identified with God, by virtue\nof standing in a possessive relationship with him, and appears to be an aspect or emanation\nof the deity rather than an in de pen dent agent. Thus, God is said in three Meccan surahs to\nhave “blown” (nafakha; see Durie 2018, 171–172) “some of his spirit” (min + rūḥ + posses-\nsive suffix) into Adam (Q 15:29, 32:9, 38:72: wa- nafakha fīhi min rūḥihi / nafakhtu fīhi min\nrūḥī). Similarly, a Meccan and a Medinan verse report that God blew some of his spirit into\nMary, presumably at the moment of Jesus’s conception (Q 21:91, 66:12: fa-n afakhnā fīhā/\nfīhi min rūḥinā, with fīhi in 66:12 referring back to farj). The idea that it was an insufflation\nof God’s spirit that caused Mary to fall pregnant may also be reflected in another Medinan\nstatement about Jesus, Q 4:171, according to which Jesus is— meaning, perhaps, “is created\nfrom” (or perhaps “is endowed with”?)— God’s spirit (rūḥun minhu).9 In the cases of both\nAdam and Jesus, God’s spirit is “an impersonal thing, a breath of life, originating with Allah\nand animating the h uman body” (O’Shaughnessy 1953, 25). A similar understanding of the\nspirit as an impersonal real ity imparted by God emerges from Medinan affirmations that\nGod has fortified the believers with his spirit (Q 58:22: wa- ayyadahum bi- rūḥin minhu)10 or\n8 The link between Luke and Q 19:17 may, of course, have been mediated by intervening texts and traditions.\nThis is well illustrated by Q 19:17. The verse is normally understood to say that God’s spirit appeared to Mary\n“as a shapely human” (basharan sawiyyā). By contrast, the annunciation passage in Luke 1 does not specify the\nappearance of Gabriel (even though one may argue that Mary’s perplexity in Luke 1:29 suggests that Gabriel was\nnot immediately identifiable as an angel). The Qur’anic account therefore stands out from Luke by virtue of the\nadditional motif of God’s superhuman messenger to Mary being expressly said to have appeared in a human guise.\nBut this motif is traceable in pre- Qur’anic Christian tradition: Yousef Kouriyhe has drawn attention to Ephrem’s\nstatement in his Hymns on the Nativity that Gabriel took on the appearance of a “comely” or “splendid” (hdīrā)\nand “honourable” (myattbā) old man when appearing to Mary, so as not to frighten her (e.g., by appearing as\nan angel, or indeed as a young man, whom she might have perceived as a threat). See Beck 1959, De Nativitate,\nno. 2:19, and https:// corpuscoranicum . de / kontexte / index / sure / 19 / vers / 17 (accessed 15 July 2021). Specifically,\nboth the Qur’an and Ephrem do not just note the h uman form of Mary’s interlocutor but also accentuate his\nhandsome and pleasant aspect (Arabic: sawiyy, Syriac: hdīrā). What the Qur’anic account lacks, of course, is the\nnotion that the spirit takes the form specifically of an old man, so as to avoid seeming like a threat.\n9 Of course, rūḥun minhu literally means only “a spirit of/from him,” but it is defensible to equate rūḥun\nminhu with rūḥuhu here— just as Jesus can be described, apparently interchangeably, both as “God’s word”\n(Q 4:171: Jesus is “God’s messenger and his word,” rasūlu llāhi wa- kalimatuhu) and as “a word of/from God”\n(Q 3:39.45: bi-k alimatin mina llāhi / bi- kalimatin minhu). The use of min to paraphrase a genitive of possession\nis well attested in Arabic (Reckendorf 1921, 258–259), and so is a phenomenon that Reckendorf calls “emphatic\nindetermination,” often found in poetry: despite the fact that a given context of speech would lead one to expect\na determinate noun, a poet may nonetheless employ an indeterminate noun instead, leaving it to the recipient\nto work out that reference is to one specific individual (Reckendorf 1895–1898, 163–164). As Reckendorf writes,\n“the impact of such an instance of indetermination rests on the fact that one’s imagination is seemingly given a\ncertain leeway to individualise [the expression], yet frequently a certain compulsion is nonetheless brought to\nbear on the hearer to determine [the expression] in the manner intended by the speaker.” In view of this general\nphenomenon as well as the fact that other Qur’anic passages speak explic itly of God’s spirit by directly combining\nrūḥ with a possessive suffix (e.g., Q 15:29, 66:12), I therefore propose to construe rūḥun minhu in Q 4:171 and also\nbi- rūḥin minhu in 58:22 (on which see below in the main text) as instances of emphatic indetermination. The two\nexpressions should accordingly be rendered “his spirit” rather than “a spirit of his / from him” in order to avoid\ngiving the inaccurate impression that there could be more than one spirit of God.\n10 On bi- rūḥin minhu as an instance of emphatic indetermination, see the previous note.\nrūḥ 357", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As\nO’Shaughnessy has recognised (O’Shaughnessy 1953, 26), the phrase must be placed against\nthe background of Gen 2:7, according to which God created Adam and then “breathed\n(wayyippaḥ, Peshitta: npaḥ) into his nostrils the breath of life (nišmat ḥayyîm).” O’Shaugh-\nnessy adds that this divinely infused “breath of life” from Gen 2:7 is in other Biblical pas-\nsages called rûaḥ ḥayyîm, “spirit of life,” which becomes rūḥā d-ḥ ayyē in the Syriac Peshitta\n(Gen 6:17, 7:15.22), thus taking us even closer to Qur’anic phraseology. Hence, even if the\nQur’an does not explic itly state that the rūḥ that God blows into Adam and Mary is life-\ngiving (Durie 2018, 172), the Qur’anic collocation of nafakha and rūḥ may be considered\nto deploy Biblically informed diction.12 Indeed, O’Shaughnessy manages to identify a re-\nmarkably exact equivalent of the Qur’anic phrase wa- nafakha fīhi min rūḥihi in the Syriac\nwriter Aphrahat: wa- npaḥ beh men rūḥeh (Demonstrations 17:7 = Parisot 1894, 799–800;\nsee also variations of the same formulation in Demonstrations 17:6 = Parisot 1894, 793–794,\nand Demonstrations 23:58 = Parisot 1907, 117). O’Shaughnessy additionally quotes the same\nphrase from the Book of Steps (O’Shaughnessy 1953, 29). This confirms that the Qur’an is\nnot specifically citing Aphrahat h ere but rather is picking up Syriac diction that enjoyed\nwider currency. Particularly compelling is the presence in Syriac of a counterpart to the\nQur’an’s con spic u ous min, whose putative point is to emphasise that h umans are at most\nparticipants in God’s spirit rather than in full possession of it. Intriguingly, a poem describ-\ning God’s creation of Adam that is attributed to the Christian ʿAdī ibn Zayd also mentions\nGod’s “blowing of the spirit” into Adam’s body (bi- nafkhati l- rūḥi fī l- jismi; al- Muʿaybid\n1965, no. 103:8; Dmitriev 2010, 360 and 364). Apparently, the notion was current in Arabic\nby the end of the sixth c entury.\nTo indulge in a brief digression, it is worth noting that O’Shaughnessy’s discovery\nthrows in ter est ing light on the emergence of Qur’anic formulaic language more generally.\nIf one adheres to a conventional understanding of the Qur’an’s internal chronology that\nplaces the Meccan surahs before the Medinan ones, it appears that the Qur’anic composi-\ntions’ propensity to employ formulaic language increased over time (see Bannister 2014,\n143).13 This development can be accounted for by positing that the Qur’anic proclamations,\nrather than relying on a well- established repository of formulaic phraseology from the\n11 To be sure, Durie subsumes these passages under “rūḥ as an angelic being” (Durie 2018, 168–169). Yet\nthe only thing that might conceivably incline one to view the rūḥ as an angelic agent here is the collocation with\nal- qudus, recalling Q 16:102.\n12 According to Durie, Q 15:29 “does not mean that Allāh ‘breathed the breath of life’ into Ādam, but that\nhe blew a puf of air into him, thereby bringing him to life.” However, this deflationary reading fails to do justice\nto the possessive pronoun suffixed to min rūḥ, which makes explicit that what is being blown into Adam is God’s\nspirit rather than just air.\n13 Unlike me, Bannister considers this result a glaring anomaly that calls into doubt the standard view of\nthe Qur’an’s genesis and chronology (Bannister 2014, 145–146). His rationale is the assumption that a higher\ndegree of formulaic density indicates a higher likelihood of having emerged from oral composition: “Why should\nthose suras commonly said to date from l ater in Muhammad’s prophetic c areer apparently display more of the\nhallmarks of orality than those supposedly from the earlier phase of his ministry?”\n358 rūḥ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This latter point is well illustrated by O’Shaughnessy’s Syriac\nparallels to the formulaic system consisting of nafakha + fī + min rūḥi + possessive suffix: his\nparallels show that at least some of the individual ele ments that entered into the Qur’an’s\nformulaic thesaurus derived from pre- existing discursive traditions, such as Syriac Chris-\ntian or, in other cases, rabbinic language.15 In the course of the Qur’an’s pro cess of formulaic\nconsolidation, t hese elem ents of diverse provenance then became fused together into what\nwe would now think of as distinctively Qur’anic language.\nIn adopting existing phraseology, one may add, the Qur’anic proclamations sometimes\nintroduced discernible inflections of meaning and usage. This, too, is neatly exemplified\nby the nafakha + rūḥ cluster. The parallels from Aphrahat all relate to God’s primordial\nblowing of his spirit into the newly created Adam. The Meccan verse Q 21:91, however,\ntransfers this motif from the creation of Adam to that of Jesus. This is plausibly viewed as\na shift that is original to the Qur’an. It is true that Luke 1:35 has Gabriel announce to Mary\nthat “the Holy Spirit will come upon you,” meaning that the Qur’anic position of involving\nthe “spirit” in Mary’s impregnation is not unpre ced ented (Reynolds 2018, 519). Moreover,\ncontrastive links between Adam and Jesus are a well- established Christian motif (e.g.,\nRom 5:14–21 and 1 Cor 15:21–22; see BEQ 43–44 and O’Shaughnessy 1953, 26–27 and 60).\nYet the Qur’an puts this standard association between Adam and Jesus to very distinctive\nuse, by deploying it in such a way as to undercut the mainstream Christian insistence\non the divinity of Jesus: Jesus is created, not begotten—or rather, the way in which his\nbegetting is described in Q 21:91 utilises language that is highly, and presumably deliber-\nately, suggestive of the chronologically earlier Qur’anic account of the creation of Adam\nin the early Meccan verse 15:29, the objective being to highlight that Jesus, like Adam,\nis only a creature of God rather than his consubstantial son.16 This conjectured rationale\n14 This description only seeks to capture a general drift; it should be borne in mind that the Qur’an exhibits\nat least some formulaic systems that emerge in Meccan surahs but are discontinued in the Medinan ones, and\nothers that only emerge in the Medinan Qur’an to begin with. For instances of the former category, see examples\n1, 2, and 4 in Bannister 2014, 220–221.\n15 For a similar case, in which the antecedent is however rabbinic rather than Christian, see the parallels\nadduced for the Qur’anic use of → khalāq in Q 2:102.200 and 3:77. Another Qur’anic formula for which one\nmight want to countenance a pre- Qur’anic origin, though without the existence of an undeniable pre- Qur’anic\nparallel, is the disobedience formula fa- sajadū illā iblīsa from the Qur’anic Adam narrative, “and they [the angels]\nprostrated themselves [to Adam]; not so Iblīs”; see under → shayṭān.\n16 A similar approach— associating Adam and Jesus for the purpose of highlighting the latter’s humanity\nand createdness—is seen in Q 3:59, declaring that Adam and Jesus were both created by divine fiat: “With regard\nto God, Jesus is like Adam; God created him [Adam] from earth, and then said to him, ‘Be,’ and he was” (inna\nmathala ʿīsā ʿinda llāhi ka-m athali ādama khalaqahu min turābin thumma qāla lahu kun fa- yakūn). It is not im-\nmediately evident how the scenario of vivification by an infusion of God’s spirit that emerges from verses like\nQ 15:29 and 21:91 is to be reconciled with the scenario of vivification by divine fiat in Q 3:59, which postdates the\nMeccan nafakha fīhi min rūḥihi passages. On the other hand, harmonisation does not seem downright impossible\neither; and as we saw, the insufflation paradigm is repeated in one Medinan verse, Q 66:12, which may suggest\nthat the co- existence of the two motifs was not felt to be a problematic case of Qur’anic self-contradiction.\nAs for Q 3:59, what the verse does is to describe the creation of Adam and Jesus in line with a general notion\nof divine creation by fiat that is already in evidence in Meccan verses (e.g., Q 36:82: “when he”— God— wants\nsomething, his command is merely to say to it, ‘Be,’ and it is”; see similarly the Meccan verses Q 6:73, 16:40,\n19:35, 40:68). More particularly, Q 3:59 may be regarded a development specifically of Q 19:35 (on which see\nrūḥ 359", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

More difficult to allocate than all the rūḥ passages con-\nsidered so far are the later Meccan verses Q 16:2, 17:85, 40:15, and 42:52, all of which belong to\nsurahs with a mean verse length between 89 and 100 transliteration letters (HCI 114–115)\nand are therefore likely to be chronologically close to one another. According to Q 16:2\nand 40:15, God “sends down the angels with the spirit, [acting] by his command (bi- l- rūḥi\nmin amrihi)” or “casts the spirit [acting] by his command” (yulqī l- rūḥa min amrihi) “upon\nwhomsoever he w ills from among his servants.” In Q 42:52, meanwhile, the divine speaker\ndeclares, “Thus do we convey to youS a spirit [acting] by our command” (wa- ka- dhālika\nawḥaynā ilayka rūḥan min amrinā). On terminological grounds, this rūḥ-m in-a mrihi bundle\n(on which see u nder → amr) should also be deemed to include Q 17:85, which responds to an\naudience query about the nature of the spirit (“They ask youS about the spirit”) by describing\nthe spirit as being u nder God’s command (al- rūḥu min amri rabbī). In so far as Q 16:2, 40:15,\nand 42:52 cast the spirit as an object of divine action, they fulfil the principal grammatical\ncriterion for allocation to category (ii) that was tentatively stipulated above, and it does not\nseem impossible to interpret them according to an impersonal rather than agentive under-\nstanding of the spirit. Nonetheless, the rūḥ-m in-a mrihi verses difer from passages such as\nQ 15:29 (God blows some of his spirit into Adam) or 58:22 (God has fortified the believers\nwith his spirit) b ecause at least some of them are also easily compatible with an agentive\nreading. A fter all, even an agent of God may well be “sent down” by the deity, as per Q 16:2,\njust as 19:17, quoted u nder (i), first mentions God’s spirit as an object of divine sending (fa-\narsalnā ilayhā rūḥanā) but then has the spirit act in an in de pen dent capacity (fa- tamaththala\nlahā basharan sawiyyā). The rūḥ-m in-a mrihi bundle thus exhibits an ambiguity that justifies\nseparating it out from the previous two categories.\nA development from an agentive to an impersonal understanding of the spirit? Most\nof the passages falling u nder category (i) are early Meccan, while Medinan verses are ex-\nclusively limited to category (ii). This makes it attractive to conjecture a broad diachronic\ndevelopment from a personal or agentive conception of the spirit to an impersonal one.18\nThe chronological pattern is however not without disruption: the first, agentive category\n(i) does contain two l ater Meccan passages, namely, Q 16:102 (which identifies “the holy\nspirit” as the con vey or of the Qur’anic revelations) and Q 19:17 (where God’s spirit appears\nto Mary), while category (ii) includes an early Meccan passage, Q 15:29.19 In addition, it\nalso the following note), where the kun fa-y akūn phrase is already used in connection with Jesus. At the same\ntime, of course, Q 3:59 harks back to 3:47, where the kun fa-y akūn formula serves to convey God’s omnipotence\nto Mary, who remarks that no man has “touched” her yet.\n17 Most of t hese explic itly anti- Christological or anti- Trinitarian statements in the Qur’an date to the Me-\ndinan period. Yet Qur’anic disapproval of Christian theology predates the hijrah. This is shown by Q 19:35,\nbelonging to an insertion that encompasses 19:34–40 and is prob ably con temporary with the Meccan passage\nQ 43:57–65 (HCI 186, n. 87).\n18 This is at least suggested in O’Shaughnessy 1953, 25, commenting on the shift between the early and m iddle\nMeccan surahs according to the chronology of Weil and Nöldeke. O’Shaughnessy’s treatment of the material\nsubsequently complicates m atters, however, as he ends up positing a relatively untidy vacillation between dif-\nfer ent notions of the spirit whose under lying doctrinal coherence O’Shaughnessy does not succeed in bringing\nout (see, e.g., his conclusion in O’Shaughnessy 1953, 67–68).\n19 This verse is early Meccan only according to the definition of the early Meccan surahs put forward in HCI\n161, not according to the chronology of Weil and Nöldeke (who date Surah 15 to the middle Meccan period).\n360 rūḥ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Th ere is accordingly\nsome phraseological and lexical overlap between the agentive and the impersonal sets (i)\nand (ii). Also noteworthy is the fact that Surah 16 comprises both a verse in which the spirit\nis patently invoked in an agentive fashion (Q 16:102) and another verse that was treated\nunder (iii), namely, Q 16:2 (God “sends down the angels with the spirit, [acting] by his\ncommand”). All of these observations cast doubt on an overly categorical demarcation of\ntwo consecutive evolutionary stages.\nAgainst the background of the preceding observations, some form of harmonising the\nQur’an’s two manners of representing the spirit looks preferable to a strict developmental\nhypothesis. It is significant that the Christian understanding of the Holy Spirit similarly\nenvisages the latter as a separate person of the Trinity but also as something that will be\n“poured out upon all flesh” (Acts 2:17, citing Joel 3:1–2). There was, accordingly, a pre-\nQur’anic model for speaking of “the spirit” from two dif ere nt yet complementary vantage\npoints, namely, as a personal real ity that is in some sense conceptually separable from God\nthe F ather and as a vivifying or fortifying princi ple that God bestows upon his creatures. It\nis therefore defensible to credit the Meccan Qur’an with a similarly integrative notion of\nGod’s spirit, which would have made it pos sib le to envisage the spirit both in a personified\nfashion, as in Q 78:38 (according to which on the day of judgement “the spirit and the angels\nstand in ranks”), and as an impersonal princip le imparted by God, as in Q 15:29 (where the\ncreator blows “some of his spirit” into Adam). Such a person-p rinciple duality, according\nto which the spirit may with equal validity be described both as a personal agent and as a\ndivinely imparted princi ple of vivification or fortification, also proves helpful in making\nsense of the fact that the Meccan surahs put forward two scenarios of the conception of\nJesus that are superficially rather dif ere nt: on the one hand, Q 19:17–21 recounts a dialogue\nbetween Mary and God’s spirit leading up to her impregnation; on the other hand, Q 21:91\nportrays the conception of Jesus as involving God blowing “some of his spirit” into Mary.\nIn line with the preceding remarks about the Qur’anic notion of the spirit being rooted in\na person- principle duality, we cannot rule out that the Qur’anic addressees found it pos si-\nble to suppose that the personified spirit who appeared to Mary according to Q 19:17 was\nthe very same being that was subsequently insufflated into her womb, as per 21:91. After\nall, the most straightforward reading of the spirit’s statement in Q 19:19 that he has been\ninstructed to “give” (li- ahaba) Mary a “pure boy” is that the agent of Mary’s impregnation\nwas precisely God’s spirit himself.20\nStill, a general Qur’anic drift from speaking of the spirit qua separate agent to speaking\nof the spirit qua fortifying inspiration emanating from God— the latter being predominant\nin Medinan passages—is hard to deny. In such a qualified diachronic scheme, which only\nclaims to track a relatively superficial change in emphasis rather than a drastic reversal in\nthe spirit’s ontological nature, the repeated assertion in the rūḥ-m in-a mrihi verses (Q 16:2,\n17:85, 40:15, and 42:52) that the spirit is “due to” or operating u nder God’s command\n(amr) may be understood to pave the way for the lasting shift towards an impersonal de-\npiction of the spirit that is observable in the Medinan surahs. That such a shift occurred\n20 Note also that on stylistic grounds the two passages at hand are unlikely to be separated by a significant\nperiod of time: the mean verse length of Surah 19 is 62.42, while that of Surah 21 is 67.08.\nrūḥ 361", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is palpably a resonance of the\nearly Meccan statement Q 26:193–194 (nazala bihi l- rūḥu l- amīn // ʿalā qalbika); yet 2:97\navoids calling the superhuman transmitter of God’s revelations “the spirit,” replacing this\ndesignation by the name of Gabriel instead. The reason for this substitution may be that\n“the spirit” had by now become much more univocally associated with an impersonal\nquality bestowed by God.\nTo summarise, what the material analysed in the pre sent entry suggests is an evolution-\nary drift leading from an integrative conception of the spirit, according to which the latter\ncould be envisaged both as a vivifying or fortifying princip le originating from God and as\na divine hypostasis capable of manifesting itself in the guise of an in de pen dent agent, to\na more narrowly impersonal view. What caused this gradual narrowing of the Qur’anic\nnotion of the spirit? Although the textual data do not permit us to go beyond speculation,\nthe narrowing just described could have been spurred by objections to the efect that early\nQur’anic verses casting the spirit as an in de pen dent agent were guilty of violating the\nMeccan Qur’an’s own strictures against “associationism” (shirk; see under → ashraka). In\nother words, it is pos si ble to surmise that uncharitable addressees of the Qur’anic procla-\nmations would have gratefully exploited the opportunity to assimilate the Qur’anic spirit\nto a quasi- divine figure besides God, and to use this as polemical leverage allowing them\nto accuse the Qur’anic proclaimer and his adherents of doctrinal inconsistency. As argued\nelsewhere (→ amr), the audience question cited in Q 17:85 (“They ask youS about the\nspirit”) may manifest just such an adversarial criticism, and the fourfold emphasis that the\nspirit is subject to God’s amr or command in Q 16:2, 17:85, 40:15, and 42:52 is best read as\nserving to repel an objection along these lines.\narāda tr. | to want, intend, or will s.th.\narāda tr. bi- | to intend s.th. for s.o.\narāda an/li- | to want to do s.th.\n→ shāʾa\nirtāba intr. | to be in doubt\nrayb | doubt\nrībah | cause of doubt\nmurīb | disquieting\nFurther vocabulary discussed: shakk | doubt kitāb | scripture qalb | heart al-\nsāʿah | the hour (of the resurrection) a jal | term\nThe root r- y- b generally denotes a state of m ental disquiet, agitation, and suspicion (AEL\n1197–1199).

It is quite conceivable that the word is employed intransitively rather than\ntransitively h ere, i.e., in the sense of harbouring, rather than inducing, disquiet and doubts\n(e.g., Ṭab. 21:439; Zam. 5:599–600). This would make it one of many instances of cognate\nsubstitution in the Qur’an (see generally Stewart 2009, 20–25).\nDerived from the same root, the intransitive verb irtāba describes being in a state of\ndisquiet occasioned by uncertainty and is therefore appropriately rendered as “to doubt” (a\ntranslation also supported by the recurrent association if r- y- b with the word shakk). Thus,\nQ 65:4 decrees that divorced wives who are post- menopausal are to abide by a waiting\nperiod of three months before a subsequent marriage, if the Qur’anic addressees are in\ndoubt (ini rtabtum)—p resumably, as to whether the w oman in question might nonetheless\nbe pregnant; Q 2:282 demands that debts be recorded in writing so that “youp may not\nbe in doubt”; and Q 5:106 stipulates that witnesses to a deathbed bequest are to be made\nto confirm the truthfulness of their testimony by an oath, “if youp are in doubt” (ini rtab-\ntum). More often, though, irtāba— like the expression shakk murīb—is used for doubt in\nreligious rather than mundane matters. For instance, Q 9:45 employs the phrase irtābat\nqulūbuhum, “their hearts are in doubt,” as an antonym of belief in God and the final day;\nQ 49:15 says that the believers are “t hose who believe in God and his Messenger and then do\nnot doubt (lam yartābū) and contend on God’s path with their possessions and their lives”;\nand according to Q 57:14, doubting is one of the traits of the damned (see also Q 24:50,\n29:48, and 74:31). The Qur’an’s per sist ent association of doubt with unbelief is reminiscent\nof the antithesis between belief (Greek: pistis, Syriac: haymānūtā) and doubt that can be\nseen in Matt 14:31 (“O you who has l ittle belief, why did you doubt?”), Matt 21:21 (“if you\nhave belief and do not doubt”; see also Mark 11:23), and in later Christian discourse, such\nas Chrysostom’s comments on the incredulity of Thomas in John 20:24–29 (Schaf 1995,\n14:327 = Chrysostom, Homilies on the Gospel of St. John, no. 87).1\nAn especially frequent Qur’anic derivation of the root r-y -b is the noun rayb. Consid-\nering the fact that Q 9:45 pleonastically conjoins the phrase irtābat qulūbuhum, “their\nhearts are in doubt,” with “they waver in rayb” (fa- hum fī raybihim yataraddadūn), rayb\ntoo designates a state of disquiet due to uncertainty and, in line with general practice, is\nbest translated as “doubt,” efectively functioning as the verbal noun corresponding to\nirtāba. ( There is one occurrence, in Q 9:110, of the noun rībah, which seems to signify\na par tic u lar cause of doubt here.) The term rayb prominently appears in the phrase lā\nrayba fīhi, “in/about which t here is no doubt,” which attaches predominantly to the “day”\nor “hour” of resurrection (Q 3:9.25, 4:87, 6:12, 18:21, 22:7, 40:59, 42:7, 45:26.32; see also\nunder → sāʿah), thus illustrating the crucial importance of eschatological expectation\nthroughout all of the Qur’an. Two Meccan verses (Q 10:37, 32:2) and a Medinan one\n(Q 2:2) link the formula lā rayba fīhi with the celestial scripture, prob ably by way of\nunderscoring the latter’s status as the undisputable source of the Qur’anic proclamations\n(→ kitāb). In one case, the phrase lā rayba fīhi describes the divinely specified term (ajal)\nof human life (Q 17:99), the meaning here being that human life is undoubtedly finite in\nline with a prior divine decree.2\n1 I am grateful to Nora K.

While the main Qur’anic word for “scripture” is → kitāb,\na similar meaning is conveyed by the much more infrequent noun zabūr (see generally\nJPND 205–206; FVQ 148–149; Horovitz and Firestone 2002). Before examining the word’s\nQur’anic occurrences, it is con ve nient to take note of two verses from the dīwān of Imruʾ\nal- Qays evoking the “zabūr script” or “zabūr writing” (khaṭṭ al- zabūr or khaṭṭ zabūr) that\nis found “on the palm- leaf stalk of a Yemeni” (fī ʿaṣībi yamānī; DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays,\nno. 63:1; see Stein 2021, 50)1 or “in the codices of God-f earing hermits” (fī maṣāhifi ruhbānī;\nDSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 65:2). The plural zubur occurs, moreover, in the Muʿallaqah of\nthe later poet Labīd (ʿAbbās 1962, no. 48:8 = EAP 2:168–169), where it is fairly clear that it\nmeans “pieces of writing” (Noja 1988, 5; Müller 1994, 38).\nSignificantly, a considerable cache of palm- leaf stalks inscribed in a cursive or minus-\ncule form of the South Arabian script has now been studied in detail, providing us with\na good understanding of the writing practices under lying the occurrence of zabūr in the\npoetic verses just cited (Stein 2021). In t hese palm- stalk documents, the Sabaic verb zbr\nmeans “to write” or perhaps more narrowly “to sign,” while the noun zbr, which is so far\nattested only once, is a “writing” or a “signed document” (Stein 2021, 38–43; Müller 1994,\n36). “To write” is also one of the meanings reported for the Arabic verb zabara (AEL 1210;\nsee also Müller 1994). Especially given the express reference to Yemeni palm-l eaf stalks in\none of the two verses just cited, Imruʾ al- Qays’s reference to “zabūr script” evokes a style\nof writing that is identical with or at least in some sense similar to the minuscule script\nemployed on South Arabian palm- stalk leaves (Müller 1994, 38).2 On the other hand, it is\nsalient that the second Imruʾ al- Qays passage associates “zabūr script” with the “codices\nof God- fearing hermits,” which one may presume to have been written in a very dif er ent\nscript and indeed language. The notion conveyed by the expression “zabūr script” may\nconsequently reduce to the general fact of writing rather than signifying a specific script\nor style of writing to the exclusion of others. This would also fit the verse by Labīd.\n1 Stein translates ka- khaṭṭi zabūrin fī ʿaṣībi yamānī as “the script of a rec ord on a palm-l eaf stalk in the hands\nof a Yemeni.”\n2 It has also been conjectured that zabūr could refer to the implement used, namely, a stylus (Noja 1988,\n4–5; but see Müller 1994, 38).\n364", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The latter\naspect forms a contrast with the fact that a ctual South Arabian palm-l eaf stalks often discuss\nmundane and everyday topics, such as l egal or business m atters (Stein 2021, 34–35). Yet\nas we saw above, one of the two Imruʾ al- Qays verses examined above likewise associates\n“zabūr script” with religious manuscripts. The final section of the entry will pre sent a\nhypothesis raised in earlier scholarship that is able to account for this religious shift of the\nterm in early Arabic.\nZabūr and zubur in the Qur’an. To examine the Qur’anic occurrences of the word zabūr\nin a roughly diachronic order, the plural zubur appears in the early Meccan verse Q 26:196,\nwhere the “writings of the ancients” (zubur al- awwalīn) are said to contain the same revela-\ntory content that is now communicated to Muhammad (see in more detail u nder → kitāb and\nalso under → ˻asāṭīr al- awwalīn). Other early Meccan instances of zubur are found in Q 54:43,\nwhere the term may again designate pre- Qur’anic scriptures (quite possibly intending the\nBiblical canon in par tic ul ar), and 54:52, which alludes to celestial rec ords of “every thing they\nhave done” (wa- kullu shayʾin faʿalūhu fī l- zubur, “Every thing they have done is documented in\nthe written rec ords”). Paret equates al- zubur with the scriptures of e arlier generations h ere,\npresumably in light of Q 26:196 and also the e arlier verse in the same surah, 54:43 (see Paret\n2001, on Q 54:52). Yet a more compelling parallel, which supports the understanding that\nreference is to a transcendent divine ledger, is Q 78:29: “We have enumerated every thing in\na written rec ord,” wa-kulla shayʾin aḥṣaynāhu kitābā.\nBoth the pural zubur and the singular zabūr continue to figure in a small number of l ater\nMeccan and Medinan passages. In t hese l ater periods of the Qur’an’s genesis, however, oc-\ncurrences of zabūr are overtaken in frequency by the term → kitāb, which establishes itself\nas the standard Qur’anic expression for the category of scripture. As explained in the respec-\ntive entry, the word kitāb is throughout the Qur’an applied both to the celestial archetype\nof all scriptural revelations and to earthly scriptures deriving from this archetype, such as\n“the scripture brought by Moses” (Q 6:91) or the Qur’anic proclamations. By contrast, l ater\nMeccan and Medinan occurrences of zabūr or the plural zubur are all amenable to being\nconstrued as designating textual corpora on the h uman plane alone, thereby standing out\nfrom the use of zubur for celestial rec ords in the early Meccan verse Q 54:52. Thus, accord-\ning to Q 17:55 (l ater Meccan) and 4:163 (Medinan), God gave David “a zabūr,” and 21:105\n(l ater Meccan) introduces the pronouncement that God’s right eous servants w ill inherit\nthe earth or land (cf. Ps 37:29) as something that God has “written” or “decreed” (katabnā)\n“in the zabūr.” In all three verses, David’s zabūr or “the zabūr” are presumably the Psalms\nin their capacity as a prominent religious “writing,” though one that seems to play a far less\nmomentous role in religious history than the Mosaic scripture.\nAnother occurrence of zubur comes at Q 23:53. The verse complains that after the\nrevelation of the scripture (al-k itāb) to Moses (v. 49) and after the ministry of Jesus\n(v. 50) humans divided into dif er ent sects or factions (singular: → ḥizb) and makes an\nenigmatic reference to zubur in this context: “They became divided among themselves\nover their afair (taqaṭṭaʿū amrahum baynahum)3 with regard to writings (zuburan), every\n3 On the question w hether taqaṭṭaʿa is transitive or, as one might expect on morphological grounds, in-\ntransitive in Q 21:93 and 23:53 (both of which share the phrase taqaṭṭaʿū amrahum baynahum), see CDKA 227.\nOther Qur’anic expressions for communal discord and disunity in religious m atters are ikhtalafa and tafarraqa\n(see under → bayyana) and farraqū dīnahum (see under → ḥizb).\nzabūr 365", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Still, it is difficult to decide whether the zubur are to\nbe equated with the scriptural canons of Jews and Christians here— i.e., with the Torah\n(→ al-t awrāh) and the → injīl—or instead allude to non- scriptural or parascriptural lit-\ner a ture in the Biblical tradition. Things are clearer for the later Meccan verse Q 35:25\nand the Medinan one 3:184. Both declare that previous messengers brought “clear signs\n(bayyināt), writings (al-z ubur), and the illuminating scripture (al-k itāb al-m unīr).”4 The\nfact that the zubur are conveyed by messengers entails that at least in Q 35:25 and 3:184\nthey cannot be religious texts of a post- revelatory origin. The most plausible construal\nof Q 35:25 and 3:184 is therefore a pleonastic one, according to which the “clear signs,”\nthe “writings,” and the “illuminating scripture” are alternative expressions referring to\none and the same phenomenon, namely: divine revelations that derive from the celestial\narchetype of all scriptural revelation (“the illuminating scripture”), that contain “clear\nsigns” by means of which God admonishes humans, and that might be set down in and\ntransmitted as religious writings (zubur). Overall, in the later Meccan and Medinan surahs\nthe word zubur seems to function as a fairly generic term for written texts of a religious\nnature. Despite their origin in divine revelation, Q 23:53 hints that such writings or zubur\nplay a role in the disputes between the dif ere nt factions into which the h uman addressees\nof God’s revelations have culpably split.\nA semantic merger of Arabic zabūr with Hebrew mizmôr and/or its Aramaic cog-\nnates? How do we explain the fact that almost all Qur’anic occurrences of the word zabūr\n(with the pos sib le exception of Q 54:52), and incipiently also one of the two Imruʾ al- Qays\nverses, apply it to texts of a religious kind? A v iable conjecture is that the word zabūr un-\nderwent semantic confluence with the similar-s ounding words mizmôr (Hebrew), mazmōrā\n(Syriac), or mazmor/mazmora or mizmor/mizmora (Jewish Aramaic), all of which mean\n“psalm” (FVQ 149; Müller 1994, 38; for dictionary entries, see DTTM 755, DJBA 654, DJPA\n298, and SL 735). This hypothesis is especially pertinent in view of the explicit Qur’anic\nassociation of David—t raditionally believed to be the author of the Psalms—w ith a zabūr in\nQ 4:163 and 17:55 as well as the fact that 21:105 quotes a Psalmic promise as being contained\n“in the zabūr.” It is likely that this merger was not due to misunderstanding on the part of\nMuhammad (thus JPND 205) but rather that it occurred in the language of Arabophone\nJewish and Christian communities prior to the Qur’an, as suggested by Jefery (FVQ 149).\nEven Jefery, however, describes the hy po thet ic al merger between zabūr and mazmōrā etc.\nas a case of “confusion,” which from a linguistic perspective is unduly judgemental. More\nappropriately, Stein speaks of a “mingling” of zabūr with mizmôr (Stein 2021, 7, n. 25).\nNotwithstanding the pertinence of the preceding conjecture, there are only three\nQur’anic passages in which zabūr or al- zabūr would be translatable as “a corpus of psalms”\n(Q 4:163, 17:55) or “the Psalms” (Q 21:105). Other Qur’anic occurrences, by contrast, show\nbeyond doubt that the word remained available to refer to a piece of writing or a written\ntext more generally. Even if the merger just described took place, therefore, the word zabūr\ndid not evolve into a downright proper name for the Psalms. In recognition of this, it seems\npreferable to follow a general policy of rendering Qur’anic zabūr as “writing” or the like\n4 See also Q 16:44, which lists only “clear signs” and zubur.\n366 zabūr", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The same\ntree would also seem to figure in Q 17:60, which speaks of “the tree cursed in the Qur’an”\n(al- shajarah al- malʿūnah fī l- qurʾāni; see generally El-A wa 2006 and Radscheit 2010; on\nQ 37:63 and 17:60 in par tic u lar, see also u nder → balā). The use of the collective expression\nshajar min zaqqūm in Q 56:52 raises the possibility that the Qur’an is speaking not of one\nindividual tree but rather of a certain type of tree (see also Radscheit 2010, 103). Zaqama\nis said to mean “to gobble s.th. up” and tazaqqama “to swallow s.th.” (AEL 1238–1239; see\nalso Radscheit 2010, 100). The noun zaqqūm is likely to be an enigmatic proper name of\nsorts, similar to the expressions sijjīn, ʿilliyyīn, and tasnīm in Q 83:7–8.18–19.27 or salsabīl in\nQ 76:18. At least in some cases, such enigmatic proper names may convey difuse semantic\nconnotations by virtue of their root consonants. For instance, sijjīn—in line with its pre-\nsumptive root s- j- n—is plausibly associated with infernal imprisonment (O’Shaughnessy\n1961, 444). Following this line of thought, the “tree of zaqqūm” might perhaps be rendered\n“the ingurgitation tree.”1 It should be noted that the morphological pattern faʿʿūl generally\nfunctions as an intensifying adjective (Wright 1974, 1:137–138; see also Radscheit 2010, 121).\nParsing the “tree of zaqqūm” as “the ingurgitation tree” also coheres with Q 37:66 and\n56:53, both of which affirm that the denizens of hell “fill their bellies with it” (fa- māliʾūna\nminhā l- buṭūn; cf. also Q 44:45).2\nWensinck hypothesises that the Qur’anic zaqqūm tree (or trees) might ultimately be\ndescended from the forbidden “tree of the knowledge of good and evil” from Gen 2:16–17\n(Wensinck 1921, 34). This hypothesis is endorsed and further developed by Radscheit and\nBumazhnov (Radscheit 2010, 107–118; Bumazhnov 2018). Thus, Radscheit cites passages\nfrom the Acts of Thomas and the Acts of Peter that may be understood to describe the for-\nbidden tree of paradise as “ bitter” and to associate it with Satan (Radscheit 2010, 115–117;\nmore circumspectly, see Bumazhnov 2018, 48), and Bumazhnov pre sents further Christian,\nGnostic, and Manichaean materials dwelling on the bitterness or even poisonous nature\nof the tree of knowledge. However, as Radscheit himself concedes, the Qur’an places the\nzaqqūm tree in a very dif er ent context, namely, the punishment of sinners in hell (Rad-\nscheit 2010, 118). This vital diference in context and the lack of any real descriptive parallels\nmake the Wensinck-R adscheit hypothesis difficult to verify in any compelling fashion. All\n1 I am grateful to Shawkat Toorawa for helping me think about dif er ent ways of translating the difficult\nword zaqqūm.\n2 Within his theory that the Qur’anic zaqqūm tree may have developed out of the Biblical “tree of the\nknowledge of good and evil” (see below), Radscheit attempts to derive zaqqūm from Greek sykon, “fig,” via\nSyriac (Radscheit 2010, 119–125). Yet the complexity of his derivation is such as to make it very questionable, in\nmy view, whether it is a superior explanatory model to the inner- Arabic etymologisation just outlined.\nzaqqūm 367", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Apart from general appeals to “spend” (anfaqa) from what\nGod has “provided” (→ razaqa), charitable giving is designated by two difer ent nouns in\nthe Qur’an, ṣadaqah and zakāh. The former expression, which is treated separately\n(→ ṣadaqah) is confined to Medinan verses. By contrast, zakāh—w hose usual spelling هوكز\nin the Qur’an’s received consonantal text may indicate a pre- classical pronunciation zakōh\n(Al- Jallad 2017b; van Putten 2017, 64–67)—h as over thirty occurrences in both Meccan\nand Medinan surahs (e.g., Q 2:43.83.110 etc., 4:77.162, 23:4, 27:3, 30:39). Perhaps the most\nstriking feature of the Qur’anic use of zakāh is its markedly formulaic character in comparison\nto ṣadaqah.1 Thus, zakāh has no Qur’anically attested plural, is virtually always preceded by\nthe definite article,2 occurs almost always as the object of ātā, “to give,”3 and is almost\nalways found next to exhortations to perform prayer, al-ṣ alāh (e.g., Q 2:43.83.110 e tc. and\nelsewhere: aqīmū l-ṣ alāta wa-ā tū l- zakāta = “perform prayer and give the zakāh”; → ṣallā).4\n1 Another word pair exhibiting a similar contrast between more and less formulaically constrained usage\nis ṣirāṭ and → sabīl.\n2 The only verse in which zakāh refers to almsgiving and does not have the definite article is Q 30:39: mā\nātaytum min zakātin, “what you give in alms,” contrasted with mā ātaytum min riban, “what you give in usury.”\n3 The only verses in which zakāh refers to almsgiving but does not figure as the object of ātā are Q 19:31.55\nand 23:4.\n4 The only verses in which zakāh refers to almsgiving and which lack a reference to prayer are Q 7:156, 23:4,\n30:39, and 41:7. But note that Q 23:4, a very short verse, is preceded by a reference to prayer in 23:2. More fre-\nquent are references to prayer (ṣalāh) that are not accompanied by one to zakāh, e.g., Q 29:45, 30:31, 31:17, 108:2.\n368 zakkā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Rather, zakāh would in most cases seem to refer to almsgiving as a general practice,\nas opposed to individual gifts or acts of charity that are called → ṣadaqah.\nTwo verses, Q 18:81 and 19:13, use the word zakāh for “purity” rather than almsgiving.\nThis is in line with the fact that other derivatives of the root z-k-w/y, too, convey the notion\nof purity (see CDKA 121–122), such as the adjective zakiyy, “pure” (Q 18:74, 19:19), the\nverb zakkā, “to purify” (e.g., Q 2:129.151.174, 53:32, 91:9), and tazakkā “to purify o.s., to\nkeep o.s. pure” (e.g., Q 20:76, 80:3.7, 92:18).5 Against the background of the distinction\nbetween ritual and moral impurity proposed by the Biblical scholar Jonathan Klawans\n(Klawans 2002), it is notable that in the Qur’an derivatives of the consonantal root z-k-w/y\nother than zakāh can almost always be understood to refer to moral purity (but see Q 18:19,\nreferring to pure food).6 To return to the term zakāh in par tic u lar, its exceptional use to\nmean “purity” (specifically, moral purity) in Q 18:81 and 19:13 cannot be adduced to posit\nan inner- Qur’anic semantic development from a general sense of purity to the more re-\nstricted and concrete sense of alms, since another verse of Surah 19 has zakāh in the latter\nmeaning (v. 55). Indeed, zakāh = “alms” appears already in Surah 23 (v. 4), which given its\nsomewhat lower mean verse length is perhaps earlier than Surah 19.\nEtymology. Etymologically, the noun zakāh stems from (rabbinic) Hebrew zәkût or\nJudaeo- Aramaic zakuta, “merit” (CQ 21; FVQ 153; Zysow 2002, 407; on the Hebrew term\nand its cognates, see Anderson 2009, 135–137; DJBA 412–413; DJPA 176–177). Although\nthe nouns zәkût and zakuta in rabbinic texts do not specifically signify “charity” (NB 25),\nthe verb zka can mean “to give alms” in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (Horovitz 1918; DTTM\n399; DJPA 177). Moreover, the targums use zakuta or zaku to render Biblical occurrences of\nthe word ṣәdāqâ, which in rabbinic Hebrew became the standard term for charity (Zysow\n2002, 407; see, e.g., Targum Onqelos on Deut 6:25; on the semantic development of ṣәdāqâ,\nrefer to Anderson 2009, 141–142, Gardner 2015, 26–32, and Gray 2019). Rabbinic texts can\ngo so far as to interpret Biblical occurrences of ṣәdāqâ to mean “charity” against the grain\nof their original meaning (Gardner 2015, 27–29). I have been unable to identify any rabbinic\nevidence that the correlated targumic term zakuta underwent a similar concretisation\nfrom a meritorious deed in general to the giving of charity in par tic u lar (on the putative\nlogic that almsgiving is the merit- generating act par excellence). Nonetheless, somewhere\n5 That tazakkā is not a denominal verb derived from zakāh, unlike taṣaddaqa, “to give a ṣadaqah” (see\nunder → ṣadaqah), is especially clear from Q 92:18, “who gives his possessions (yuʾtī mālahu) yatazakkā,” where\nthe rendering “who gives his possessions in order to purify himself” is clearly preferable to “who gives his pos-\nsessions, thereby performing the zakāh.” None of the other Qur’anic occurrences of tazakkā support translating\ntazakkā in the concrete sense of “to give alms” rather than the general one of “to purify o.s.” It cannot be ruled\nout that in Q 87:14–15 (“Surely prosper will he who tazakkā // and invokes the name of his Lord and prays”),\nthe contextual reference is to self- purification by means of almsgiving, in which case 87:14–15 would anticipate\nthe standard Qur’anic pair of prayer and almsgiving (see also Q 35:18, which like 87:14–15 has tazakkā in close\nproximity to a mention of prayer). But even so, this would not entail that tazakkā has the lexical meaning of “to\ngive the zakāh” in the same way in which taṣaddaqa is “to give a ṣadaqah.” It should also be noted that Q 87:14\n(qad aflaḥa man tazakkā) has a close parallel in Q 91:9 (qad aflaḥa man zakkāhā, “surely prosper will he who\npurifies it”— namely, the → nafs or human person mentioned in Q 91:7–8), where the idea of purification rep-\nresents a comprehensive pursuit of virtue in general. See also Snouck Hurgronje 1957, 155–156, who sees no\nreason to limit the meaning of tazakkā in Q 87:14 to almsgiving in par tic u lar.\n6 Instances of the root ṭ- h- r, too, are predominantly non- ritual, even if at Q 2:222 and 5:6 the root is linked\nto ritual impurity.

What seems to have occurred instead is that\nzakuta and ṣlotā were fully assimilated to native Arabic words like najāh/nagōh, “salvation,”\nand ghadāh/ghadōh, “tomorrow” (Rabin 1951, 109; Al- Jallad 2017b). Just as the morpholog-\nical analogy between the names ibrāhīm, “Abraham,” and ismāʿīl, “Ishmael,” or jālūt, “Go-\nliath,” and ṭālūt, “Saul” is presumably reflective of some association between t hese figures\n(JPND 159–161; → isrāʾīl), so zakāh and ṣalāh, which are frequently paired throughout the\nQur’an, may have under gone this pro cess of assimilation to native Arabic words in tandem.8\nIn fact, a close conceptual link between almsgiving and prayer can already be discerned in\npre- Qur’anic Jewish and Christian tradition: almsgiving and prayer, together with fasting,\nbelong to a virtuous triad that stands at the centre of Matt 6:1–18 and also manifests itself\nin e arlier Second T emple traditions (Anderson 2013, 124–126, 136–148); and according to a\ndictum recorded in the Jerusalem Talmud (y. Taʿan. 2:1, 65b = ed. and trans. Guggenheimer,\n51), prayer and charity, together with repentance, form a triad of virtues that annuls the\n“harsh decree.”9 The morphological similarity between zakāh and ṣalāh could therefore be\nanchored in frequent co- occurrence predating the Qur’an.\nThe ultimate etymological origin of zakāh in Aramaic zakuta does not preclude that the\nQur’an’s original recipients would have associated zakāh with the idea of purity (Snouck\nHurgronje 1957, 155; al- Farāhī 2002, 190; Nanji 2001, 66). After all, we saw above that\nother derivatives of z-k-w/y convey the notion of purity and that the noun zakāh itself is\noccasionally employed to mean “purity.”10 An association of almsgiving with purity would\nalso seem to be manifested by the fact that the Qur’an expressly asserts charitable giving\nto have a purifying efect. Thus, Q 9:103 instructs the Messenger to “take a charitable\ndonation” (ṣadaqah) from the possessions of t hose who have confessed misdeeds, so as\nto “cleanse and purify them thereby” (tuṭahhiruhum wa-t uzakkīhim bihā). Indeed, the\nconnection between almsgiving and purification emerges already very early during the\nQur’an’s genesis, since the early Meccan verse Q 92:18 promises that he “who gives his\npossessions (yuʾtī mālahu) in order to purify himself (yatazakkā)” w ill be spared the fire of\nhell. The under lying valuation of almsgiving that can be glimpsed h ere resembles Christian\n7 Zakuta would also seem to have been loaned into Epigraphic South Arabian, as zkt, but there must mean\nsomething like God’s favour or grace, as attested, e.g., by a Jewish inscription containing the phrase “with the\naid and zkt of his Lord who created his nfs1” (Robin 2000, 49–50 and 58; Gajda 2009, 234; see also Beeston et al.\n1982, 170).\n8 See already Brockelmann 1927, 14, who proposes to explain the development from zakuta to zakāh as\nbeing due to the latter’s rhyme with its frequent Qur’anic correlate ṣalāh.\n9 See also b. Rosh Hash. 16b (noted in Guggenheimer’s commentary on y. Taʿan. 2:1, 65b). There, charity\nand prayer are enumerated as part of four things on account of which somebody’s sentence is torn up. What is\nin ter est ing is that they are designated by two expressions that rhyme and are morphologically parallel, just like\nṣalāh and zakāh, namely, ṣәdaqah and ṣәʿaqah (literally, “crying out”).\n10 The later tradition links the word zakāh both to the idea of cleansing and to that of growth and augmen-\ntation (al-R āghib al- Iṣfahānī 2009, 380–381; Ṭab. 3:269), the latter via the verb zakā, “to increase” (AEL 1240).\nWhile the Qur’an does not have any clear occurrences of the root z-k-w/y in the sense of growth, it is worth noting\nQ 30:39, pointed out to me by Saqib Hussain, where the failure of usury (ribā) to generate “increase” (r- b- w)\n“with God” is contrasted with the promise that what is given in alms (zakāh) will be multiplied in reward.\n370 zakāh", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Islamic tradition considers the institution of the zakāh as a proper\nalms tax—in the sense of a regularised levy with specific tarifs—to date back to the Me-\ndinan period of Muhammad’s activity (Zysow 2002, 408–409). The Qur’an ofers only\nlimited corroboration for this. It is true that Q 9:60 suggests that t here were “agents”\n(ʿāmilūn) charged with the collection and red istribution of charitable gifts (ṣadaqāt), a\ncaptivating allusion that will be further discussed below. But the Medinan surahs do not,\nfor instance, stipulate, or even hint at the existence of, precise and mandatory tax rates\non par tic u lar types of property or income, nor do they specify the minimum amounts on\nwhich the zakāh would have been payable (Snouck Hurgronje 1957, 158–167). Thus, with\nregard to almsgiving t here is no Qur’anic equivalent to verses spelling out specific inheri-\ntance shares (Q 4:11–12.176). This runs counter to what one might have expected had the\nzakāh become a tax- like levy already during Muhammad’s lifetime.\nThe argument is of course from silence, and it could be countered by positing that Mu-\nhammad may simply have imposed the applicable rates in extra- Qur’anic pronouncements.\nStill, it does remain significant that the Qur’an confines itself to moralistic exhortations\nto give or “spend” what is pos si ble. Thus, Q 2:267 (cf. Snouck Hurgronje 1957, 166) urges\nthe believers to “spend from the good t hings you have accrued and from what we have\nbrought forth from the earth for you; and do not have recourse to what is inferior of it, to\nspend it, when you would not take it yourselves without shutting your eyes to it.” Q 2:219\ncites an audience query as to what the Qur’anic believers are to spend (yasʾalūnaka mādhā\nyunfiqūna), and responds by instructing them to spend “the surplus” (al- ʿafw),11 while\nQ 9:34 warns against amassing gold and silver (cf.

All of t hese verses are in line with ancient Arabian notions, as articulated in\npre- Islamic poetry, that one’s surplus property (faḍl al- māl) be shared out among one’s\nkin and the fellow members of one’s tribe (Bravmann 1972, 229–253). In a similar vein,\ntannaitic sources also “do not specify precisely how much one should give”: charity, “by\nnature, is an obligation that is imperfectly defined” (Gardner 2015, 163–164). In this regard,\nancient Arabian, rabbinic, and Qur’anic statements contrast with the post- Qur’anic Islamic\ntradition, which does stipulate precise tax rates.\nRecipients of charity in the Qur’an.

In fact, the sequence composed of relatives, orphans, and\nthe indigent figures in a handful of additional Qur’anic verses (in addition to Q 8:41 and\n59:7, see 2:83 and 4:8.36), sometimes preceded by parents (Q 2:83, 4:36) or followed\nby wayfarers (thus in Q 8:41 and 59:7), while Q 17:26 and 30:38 have relatives, the poor,\nand wayfarers.16 Rather than explaining this exclusively by appealing to the fact that later\nQur’anic proclamations often replicate, elaborate on, or abridge earlier ones, it is conceiv-\nable that the fivefold list of parents, relatives, orphans, the indigent, and wayfarers found\nin Q 2:215 reflects and explicates traditional, pre- Qur’anic ideas about the categories of\npersons entitled to charitable support by the community and about the relative strength\nof their claims.\nQ 9:60 and to a lesser degree also 24:22 vary and expand the Qur’an’s usual cata logue of\nlegitimate recipients of charity in accordance with specific historical circumstances. Thus,\nQ 9:60 mandates gifts of charity (ṣadaqāt) “on God’s path” (fī → sabīl allāh). In view of the\ngeneral association of the phrase fī sabīl allāh with militancy (e.g., Q 2:154.190.244.246,\n3:13.146.157.167.169), this could be interpreted as indicating that charitable gifts w ere used\nto fund military endeavours (Snouck Hurgronje 1957, 164), just as the appeal to “spend\n(anfaqa) on God’s path” can aim at securing contributions to the equipment of fighters\n(Q 8:60; see u nder → sabīl and cf. Q 2:195, where spending on God’s path is mentioned\nimmediately a fter a sequence dealing with fighting, in vv. 190–194). However, Q 24:22 and\nespecially 59:8 suggest other wise, since the former verse speaks specifically of “t hose who\nhave emigrated on God’s path” (al- muhājirūn fī sabīl allāh) while the latter assigns a share\nof booty to “the emigrant poor who have been expelled from their homes and their posses-\nsions” (li- l- fuqarāʾi l- muhājirīna lladhīna ukhrijū min diyārihim wa- amwālihim). One might\ninfer, therefore, that resources received as charitable donations or as booty w ere deployed in\norder to mitigate the straitened economic circumstances of those who had lost their homes\nand their possessions due to their loyalty to God’s cause. Another probable reflection of\nspecific historical circumstances consists in Q 9:60’s mention of “t hose whose hearts are to\n16 Most of t hese verses are enumerated in KK 94.

This suggests a certain degree of “fiscal\norganisation,” perhaps linked to the extension of Medinan dominance over surrounding\ntribes (Snouck Hurgronje 1957, 165; cf. Cook 2014, 175). Charity towards orphans and\nthe poor etc. would already have been practised before the hijrah, as attested by vario us\nMeccan passages singling out these categories of persons as meriting special support;\nbut there is no indication that such support took any other form than private initiative.\nThe Medinan period, by contrast, witnessed an instutionalisation and centralisation of\nsuch charitable aid (which is not as such equivalent to the imposition of a fixed levy). At\nthe centre of this institutionalisation stood the Qur’anic Messenger, whom Q 9:102–103\ninstructs to “take charitable gifts from the wealth of” (khudh min amwālihim ṣadaqatan)\ncommunity members who have committed sins (cf. also Q 58:12–13). The same emerges\nfrom Q 9:58–59, according to which some p eople “find fault” with the Messenger “with\nregard to charitable gifts” (man yalmizuka fī l-ṣ adaqāti). Instead, they are urged to be con-\ntent with “what God and his Messenger have given them” (mā ātāhumu llāhu wa- rasūluhu).\nAfter the hijrah, Muhammad, by virtue of his religious and po liti cal authority, became a\nnexus in the red istribution of wealth and also, as shown by Q 8:41 and 59:6–8, of spoils,\nwithin the Medinan polity (see Sinai 2018a, 14–15). To judge by Q 9:60, he was assisted in\nthis capacity by a group of fiscal agents (ʿāmilūn) who were compensated for their eforts\nwith some of the receipts from the community’s charitable donations.18 At the same time,\ndespite the role that Muhammad evidently played in receiving and redistributing charitable\ndonations, Q 2:271 encourages the secret giving of alms, which still appear to pass directly\nfrom the donor to the poor here.

Yet as we\nshall see, elsewhere the word may have a diferent sense. The exclusively Israelite context\nof asbāṭ in the Qur’an, together with its etymology, suggests that the word may derive from\nthe language of Arabophone Jews, like the term → ummī, “scriptureless.”\nChronological considerations. The term al- asbāṭ is prob ably specific to the Qur’an’s\nMedinan stratum. The occurrences at Q 2:136.140, 3:84, and 4:163 are all contained in\nsurahs that are generally recognised to be Medinan. The only pos si ble exception to this\npattern is Q 7:160, found in a surah that is normally regarded as Meccan. However, Surah\n7 is not devoid of Medinan insertions, as exemplified by Q 7:157–158 (see under → ummī)\nand prob ably also by 7:171–174 (Hartwig 2008, 192–193). One may conjecture, therefore,\nthat the section on the Israelites tribes in Q 7:160–168 (which is demarcated by an inclu-\nsio created by verse- initial wa- qaṭṭaʿnāhum, “and we divided them,” in vv. 160 and 168) is\nlikewise Medinan.1 The polemical stridency of vv. 160–168 is certainly more reminiscent\n1 Pohlmann (in Amir- Moezzi and Dye 2019, 2:320) considers the overlap between Q 7:160 and 7:168 to\nindicate “dif er ent hands” and fails to consider, in characteristic fashion, that t here might be such a thing as\n376", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Nonetheless, deciding the issue\nrequires a much more detailed analy sis of the redactional history of Surah 7 than is feasible\nin the pre sent context.2\nDoes the term asbāṭ convey a consistent meaning across all of its Qur’anic occur-\nrences? Jefery observes that in Q 2:136.140, 3:84, and 4:163, unlike in 7:160, the asbāṭ figure\nin lists of Israelite recipients of divine revelation beginning with Abraham; three of t hese\noccurrences (Q 2:136, 3:84, and 4:163) make use of the verbs → anzala, “to send down”\nor → awḥā, “to convey revelations.” Jefery’s own proposal that Q 2:136 e tc. erroneously\napply the plural al- asbāṭ to the minor prophets is hardly compelling; but there is a real\nquestion mark over the extent to which the word’s use in Q 2:136 and parallels, where the\nasbāṭ are enumerated among exemplary prophetic figures, is fully consistent with 7:160–168,\nwhere the Israelite tribes are charged with serial disobedience of God. Th ere is certainly\nnothing about Q 2:136.140, 3:84, and 4:163, if not immediately harmonised with 7:160, that\nwould compel one to understand the asbāṭ as a plurality of tribal groups h ere rather than as\na plurality of individuals, such as the sons of Jacob. Another arguable anomaly is that Q 2:136\nand its parallels all place the asbāṭ a fter Jacob and, in two cases, before Moses (Q 2:136,\n3:84), whereas 7:160 f. strongly implies that the asbāṭ w ere cont emporary with Moses. It\nis admittedly uncertain that Qur’anic cata logues of names may be treated as implying his-\ntorical sequentiality. Moreover, according to Biblical genealogy the twelve tribes of Israel\nare of course descended from the sons of Jacob, which might explain why the asbāṭ are\nlisted immediately following Jacob. Even so, however, it remains notable that Q 2:136 and\nits parallels envisage the asbāṭ as pious descendants of Jacob who inherited his prophetic\nstanding, whereas 7:160–168 cast them as unruly ingrates. Overall, t here is good reason to\ntranslate al- asbāṭ in Q 2:136.140, 3:84, and 4:163 as “the descendants of Jacob.”\nA pos si ble explanation for the discrepancies just noted would be (i) to posit that\nQ 7:160–168 are indeed a Medinan insertion into Surah 7, in line with the tentative con-\njecture put forward above, and (ii) to date this addition to Surah 7 l ater than all other\nQur’anic occurrences of the word asbāṭ. Assuming these two conjectures hold up, one of\nthe concerns of Q 7:160–168 might be to ensure that e arlier statements on the asbāṭ were\nread in light of their Biblically correct understanding as the twelve tribes of Israel rather\nthan as the sons of Jacob from whom t hese tribes w ere believed to be descended. A fter all,\nit is striking that Q 7:160 both supplies an in-t ext gloss on the meaning of the word asbāṭ\ncompositionally deliberate phraseological repetition. That we are confronted with an intentional inclusio is\nsupported, in my view, by the fact that Q 7:160, in the wake of the introductory wa- qaṭṭaʿnāhum phrase, moves\ninto a concrete narrative episode, whereas 7:168, following the second wa-q aṭṭaʿnāhum opening, provides a\nconcluding summary assessment of the Israelites’ moral standing.\n2 The considerations that would need to be properly explored and weighed in such a study are numerous. For\nexample, one might feel that the positive appraisal of the Israelites in Q 7:159— according to which the “ people\nof Moses” include “a community (ummah) who guide according to the truth and act justly according to it” (wa-\nmin qawmi mūsā ummatun yahdūna bi-l - ḥaqqi wa-b ihi yaʿdilūn)— jars with the bitterly critical assessment of\nthe tribes in vv. 160–168. Note also that it seems pos si ble to read v. 159 and v. 169 (which begins by saying that\n“they were succeeded by people who inherited the scripture,” fa-k halafa min baʿdihim khalfun warithū l-k itāba)\nin direct sequence. This would permit extricating vv. 160–168 as a l ater addition, with v. 159 forming part of the\nsurah’s original Meccan layer. Another observation that would need to be accommodated by any attempt to\nmake sense of the redactional history of Surah 7 is the far- reaching parallelism between Q 7:159 and 7:181 (wa-\nmimman khalaqnā ummatun yahdūna bi- l-ḥ aqqi wa-b ihi yaʿdilūn, as opposed to v. 159’s wa-m in qawmi mūsā . . .).\nBut such phraseological overlap between dif er ent verses of a surah does not, of course, entail contemporaneity.\nal-a sbāṭ 377", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Although the Qur’anic terms sabīl and ṣirāṭ belong to the\nsame general semantic field, they are not synonymous and appropriately rendered, respec-\ntively, “path” and “road” (→ ṣirāṭ). While ṣirāṭ is virtually always employed in a meta phorical\ncapacity (except for Q 7:86), sabīl is relatively frequently encountered in a concrete sense,\nsuch as in connection with the trope that God has put pathways (subul) in the earth (Q 16:15,\n20:53, 21:31, 43:10, 71:20; see u nder → arḍ).1 Sabīl can also be a “reason, possibility or oc-\ncasion to take mea sures against s.o.,” as Ambros puts it (see Q 3:75, 4:34.90; CDKA 128);\nand khalla sabīlahu is “to set s.o. f ree” (Q 9:5). Overall, in the Qur’an sabīl is a term that is\nsignificantly more frequent, more semantically heterogeneous, and phraseologically more\nversatile than ṣirāṭ.2 Despite having originally been loaned from Aramaic (FVQ 162), sabīl\nmust have been a fully Arabised word by the time of the Qur’an. Even its meta phorical\nemployment to refer to a life that is pleasing to God is not a secondary development within\nthe Qur’an, since it occurs as early as Q 80:20 or 68:7.\nSabīl and ṣirāṭ also exhibit some collocational diferences. It is only the latter term, never\nthe former, that appears with the adjective “straight” (mustaqīm), even though both God’s\n“path” and his “road” can be specified by the notion of evenness, expressed by the root\ns- w- y (for sawāʾ al-s abīl, see Q 2:108, 5:12.60.77, 28:22, and 60:1; for ṣirāṭ sawiyy / al-ṣ irāṭ\nal-s awiyy / sawāʾ al-ṣ irāṭ, see 19:43, 20:135, and 38:22).3 Mentions of God’s “straight road”\n(ṣirāṭ mustaqīm) often pair up with the notion of guidance, expressed by the root h- d- y (e.g.,\nQ 1:6, 2:142.213, 37:118), but never with the root ḍ- l- l, connoting straying and leading astray.4\n3 Which further objectives one ascribes to Q 7:160–168 w ill in part depend on one’s position regarding\nthe question w hether the surrounding verses 159 and 169 are Meccan or Medinan. For instance, if one consid-\ners Q 7:159.169 to be part of the surah’s Meccan stratum, then the account of the disobedience of the tribes in\n7:160–168 might be considered to amplify the allusion in 7:169 that some post-M osaic Israelites did not live up\nto God’s expectations.\n1 For other concrete occurrences of sabīl, see Q 18:61.63 and 29:29 as well as the expression ibn al- sabīl—o n\nwhich see under → zakāh— for “wayfarer” at 2:177.215, 4:36, 8:41, 9:60, 17:26, 30:38, and 59:7; see also 4:43.\n2 For another pair of words that are partly synonymous yet one of which is notably more formulaic than\nthe other, see → zakāh and → ṣadaqah.\n3 See also Q 67:22 for “walking evenly on a straight road,” man yamshī sawiyyan ʿalā ṣirāṭin mustaqīm.\n4 The only two verses that have both ṣirāṭ and a derivative of ḍ- l- l are Q 1:7 and 6:39, but in neither case does\nthe text explic itly speak of straying from the ṣirāṭ.\n378 sabīl", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus,\naccording to the early Meccan verse Q 68:7, “yourS Lord (rabbaka) knows best who strays\nfrom his path (man ḍalla ʿan sabīlihi), and he knows best t hose who allow themselves to be\nguided” (similarly Q 6:117, 16:125, and 53:30), and in Q 38:26, which marginally postdates\nthe early Meccan period, David is warned not to let passion or desire (al- hawā) lead him\nastray (aḍalla) “from God’s path” (ʿan sabīli llāhi). Together with derivatives of ḍ- l- l, the\nprepositional complement ʿan sabīli llāh (or the variant ʿan sabīli + suffix) recurs in other\nMeccan and Medinan verses (e.g., Q 6:116.117, 10:88, 14:30, 22:9, 31:6). Other formulations\ninvolving the term sabīl as opposed to ṣirāṭ are the late Meccan and Medinan phrase “to\nturn away from God’s path” (ṣadda ʿan sabīli llāh; e.g., 2:217, 3:99, 4:160.167, 7:45.86, 11:19,\n14:3, 16:88.94) and its exclusively Meccan variant “to turn away from the path” (ṣadda ʿani\nl- sabīl; e.g., Q 13:33, 27:24, 29:38, 40:37), which is attested as early as Q 43:37.5\nThe two paths. The Qur’an generally envisages only a single “road” (ṣirāṭ), which is\nthat of God. In Q 6:153, God’s path— which the verse also terms God’s “straight road”—is\nopposed to a plurality of paths (al- subul; see also u nder → ṣirāṭ). But there are also verses\nspeaking not only of God’s “path” (sabīl) but also of the contrary “path of the sinners”\n(Q 6:55: sabīl al-m ujrimīn), the “path of those causing corruption” (Q 7:142: sabīl al-\nmufsidīn; → afsada), the “path of t hose who have no knowledge” (Q 10:89), or the “path\nof false gods” (Q 4:76: sabīl al-ṭ āghūt; → ṭāghūt).6 Q 7:146 opposes the “right path” (sabīl\nal- rushd) and the “path of error” (sabīl al- ghayy).7 At least implicitly, this dualism of two\nantithetical life-p aths is already found in Q 76:3 and 90:10 (in the latter case using the word\nnajd rather than sabīl). The meta phor of the two ways is reminiscent of the juxtaposition\nof the “way of the just” and the “way of the wicked” in Ps 1:6 (Cuypers 2015, 173) or the\n“way of life” and the “way of death” in Jer 21:8 (which is cited, for instance, in the Apostolic\nConstitutions 7:1 = Metzger 1985–1987, 3:24–25).8 Overall, however, the dualistic image of\nGod’s path in opposition to the path of the sinners is overshadowed in the Qur’an by the\nalternative opposition of guidance along vs straying away from the one road or path that\nis God’s (Frolov 2004, 29–30).\n“On God’s path” (fī sabīl allāh). Distinctly Medinan is the prepositional phrase fī sabīl\nallāh, “on God’s path,” whose only occurrence in a Meccan surah is Q 73:20, a l ater insertion\n(GQ 1:98; Sinai 2018b, 259). Most frequently, the syntagm fī sabīl allāh accompanies the\nverbs → hājara, “to emigrate,” and → jāhada, “to contend.” In light of several occurrences\nof hājara fī sabīl allāh, “to emigrate on God’s path” (Q 4:89.100, 22:58, 24:22), it stands\nto reason that when the Qur’an refers to “ those who believe and emigrate (hājarū) and\ncontend (jāhadū) on God’s path (fī sabīl allāh)” (see, with minor variants, Q 2:218, 8:72.74,\n5 As shown by Q 3:99, 4:160, 7:86, 13:33, 27:24, 29:38, 40:37, and 43:37, ṣadda ʿan sabīl allāh / ʿan al-sabīl\nis transitive. However, many occurrences of the phrase leave the accusative object implicit. On the other hand,\nthere is also an intransitive use of the verb ṣadda (+ ʿan or min), “to turn away (from), to turn one’s back (on)”\n(CDKA 158; see Q 4:61, 43:57, 63:5).\n6 See also Q 4:115, which speaks of the one who “follows a path other than that of the believers” (wa- yattabiʿ\nghayra sabīli l- muʾminīna). On the two paths, see also Frolov 2004, 29.\n7 Cf.

In many cases, “on God’s path” furthermore complements the verbs\nqātala, “to fight,” and qatala, “to kill” (Q 2:154.190.224.246, 3:13.157.167.169.195, 4:74–76.84,\n9:111, 22:58, 47:4, 61:4, 73:20) or other verbs connoting danger to life and limb, such as\naṣāba, “to befall” (Q 3:146, 9:120) and ādhā, “to harm” (Q 3:195).11 One verse mentions the\ncommand to “march out on God’s path” (idhā qīla lakumu nfirū fī sabīli llāhi; Q 9:38; see\nalso 9:41.81). Similarly, the extra- Qur’anic treaty known as the “Constitution of Medina” has\ntwo occurrences of the phrase “on God’s path,” both of which occur in thematic connection\nwith warfare; in the first case the text expressly speaks of “fighting on God’s path” (qitāl fī\nsabīl allāh; Lecker 2004, §§ 19 and 21).12\nThe preceding yields the general impression that the Medinan surahs tend to associate\nthe meta phor of God’s path with embarking on military raids and campaigns (→ jāhada;\non Medinan militancy in general, see HCI 188–196). This understanding is also plausible for\nQ 4:94, instructing believers who “journey on God’s path” (idhā ḍarabtum fī sabīli llāhi) to\nrefrain from casually accusing somebody ofering them a greeting of being an unbeliever\n(which would make him a military target and a source of spoils). Similarly, at Q 2:273 the\naddressees are encouraged to spend on “the poor who are constrained on God’s path, being\nunable to travel in the land” (li- l- fuqarāʾi lladhīna uḥṣirū fī sabīli llāhi lā yastaṭīʿūna ḍarban fī\nl- arḍi). It is plausible that the kind of travel “on God’s path” that is envisaged h ere is military\ncampaigning. Nonetheless, a link beween the phrase fī sabīl allāh and campaigning is not\nautomatic: when Q 24:22 exhorts those with ample means to support relatives, the poor,\nand “ those who have emigrated on God’s path” (al- muhājirūn fī sabīl allāh), the reference\nto emigration “on God’s path” is clearly a reference to religious exile and to the vulnerable\neconomic situation entailed by it.13 What being expelled “on God’s path” and campaigning\n9 That the second and third verb in the triad of believing, emigrating, and contending are closely connected\nwith one another is also supported by the fact that in Q 2:218 the relative pronoun alladhīna is only repeated\nbefore the first and second elem ent of the triad: inna lladhīna āmanū wa- lladhīna hājarū wa- jāhadū fī sabīli llāhi.\n10 Asad 1980 translates fī sabīl allāh as “in God’s cause,” the drawback being that the terminological link\nbetween fighting/emigrating/contending on God’s path and other formulations involving sabīl, such as “turning\n[ others] away from God’s path” (ṣadda ʿan sabīl allāh), becomes undetectable. The formulation “in God’s cause”\nis also occasionally a dopted in Abdel Haleem 2010, but with puzzling inconsistency (see Q 4:74.75, where qātala\nfī sabīl allāh is, in one and the same context, first rendered as “to fight in God’s way” and then as “to fight in\nGod’s cause”).\n11 As pointed out by Ambros, most occurrences of ādhā refer to verbal injury, but t here are some cases where\nthe context implies physical harm (CDKA 23). Interestingly, the Armenian chronicle of Pseudo-Sebeos speaks\nof “dying . . . on the divine highway” in the context of holy war (Marsham 2009, 45). For an attempt to explain\nthe intriguing links between the Qur’an and Armenian war propaganda, see Tesei 2019.\n12 See also § 56, which refers to man ḥāraba fī l- dīn. This is prob ably synonymous with qitāl fī sabīl allāh\n(Lecker 2004, 148).\n13 This becomes especially clear when Q 24:22 is compared with 59:8, which enjoins sharing booty with\n“the emigrant poor who have been expelled from their homes and their possessions” (li- l- fuqarāʾi l- muhājirīna\nlladhīna ukhrijū min diyārihim wa- amwālihim; see also under → zakāh).\n380 sabīl", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Adhering to\nGod’s path, then, involves being ready to literally displace oneself, to abandon one’s home\nor at least temporarily to leave it b ehind. Medinan recourse to the conventional meta phor\nof God’s “path” accordingly comes to introduce a tangible aspect of instabilitas loci into\nthe Qur’an’s implicit understanding of genuine religious commitment.\n“Spending on God’s path.” A final verb that appears with fī sabīl allāh is → anfaqa,\n“to spend” (e.g., Q 2:195.261.262, 8:60, 9:34, 47:38, 57:10). Anfaqa is sometimes used in\ncontexts in which reference is clearly to charitable giving (e.g., Q 2:215.264; see also verses\nlike Q 2:3 or 35:29). This raises the possibility that “spending on God’s path” is a byword\nfor charity. On the other hand, the phrase “spending on God’s path” might also, or perhaps\neven primarily, intend the contribution of material resources to the Qur’anic community’s\nmilitary eforts (see also u nder → zakāh). This is supported by miscellaneous references\nto those who “contend (→ jāhada) by means of their possessions and their lives” (jāhadū\nbi- amwālihim wa- anfusihim; Q 4:95, 8:72, 9:20.44.81.88, 49:15, some of which also contain\nthe syntagm fī sabīl allāh): “to contend by means of one’s possessions” may well be the\nsame thing as “to spend on God’s path.” Still, some injunctions to “spend on God’s path”\nare quite generic, making it pos si ble to consider them to be mere references to charity.\nThus, in Q 2:261.262 “spending one’s possessions on God’s path” seems to be equivalent to\n“spending one’s possessions seeking God’s satisfaction” (ibtighāʾa marḍāti llāhi) from 2:265,\nwhile 2:263.264 use the word ṣadaqah, “gift or act of charity.” What the inconclusively\nseesawing character of the discussion indicates is perhaps above all that it is questionable\nto presuppose an overly clear- cut distinction between charitable giving, on the one hand,\nand backing the Qur’anic community’s military strug gle against the Meccans, on the other:\nboth entail supporting God’s cause at the expense of one’s private resources, what ever\nthe specific use that is being made of the donation at hand, just as the repudiators are in\nQ 8:36 said to “spend their possessions in order to turn [ others] away from God’s path”\n(inna lladhīna kafarū yunfiqūna amwālahum li- yaṣuddū ʿan sabīli llāhi).\nsajada intr.

This does not necessarily indi-\ncate that rakaʿa is a downright synonym of sajada. More likely, the link between the two\nverbs reflects the fact that the Qur’anic prayer ritual, like the post- Qur’anic Islamic one,\ninvolved both prostration and bowing, as a result of which the two words are sometimes\npaired up or can metonymically stand in for each other.1\nProstration in the Qur’anic milieu. By the time of the Qur’an, prostration had long\nbeen established as a potent symbolic gesture in dif er ent contexts. In the Hebrew Bible,\nprostration figures both as an act of religious worship and as a gesture of homage to other\nhumans (e.g., Gen 18:2, 19:1, 22:5, 48:12, and Exod 4:31, all of which the Syriac Peshitta\ntranslates by employing sged; see generally TDOT 4:248–255; NIDOTTE 2:42–44; Ehrlich\n2004, 38). Reverential prostration also formed part of Byzantine and Sasanian court pro-\ntocol (Canepa 2009, 150–153; see also Tottoli 1998, 6–7 and 12–15).2 That prostration as\na sign of submission and re spect was known in pre- Islamic Arabia, too, is confirmed by\nevidence from early Arabic poetry (Tottoli 1998, 9–11). Q 3:113 associates prostration in\nprayer specifically with the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb): among them, the verse\nmaintains, is “a community standing upright who recite God’s signs during the night while\nprostrating themselves.” This is likely an allusion to Christians rather than to Jews: although\nprostration was prominent in Jewish t emple rituals, the rabbinic tradition exhibits a “reluc-\ntance to employ prostration in statutory daily prayer” and gave a more prominent role to\nbowing (Ehrlich 2004, 29–63, quoting p. 43; see also Mittwoch 1913, 17). By contrast, ritual\nprostration in prayer was part of Christian monastic practices (Wensinck 1908, 104–105;\nKatz 2013, 14).\nIt would nonetheless be unwarranted to infer that prostration was considered an ex-\nclusively Christian or Judaeo- Christian practice in the Qur’an’s environment, since two\nverses use the verb sajada in connection with the worship of celestial bodies: the subjects\nof the queen of Sabaʾ are reported to have practised prostration before the sun (Q 27:24:\nyasjudūna li- l- shamsi min dūni llāhi) and Q 41:37 admonishes the Qur’anic addressees not\nto prostrate themselves to the sun and the moon but to their creator (cf. Deut 4:19). Even\nassuming that sajada li- might be functioning merely as a pars pro toto equivalent of ʿabada,\n“to serve,” in t hese two verses,3 there is no reason to posit that this would have entailed a\nloss of the verb’s literal significance. Accordingly, prostration to beings or entities other\nthan the Biblical God must have been an intelligible and sufficiently widespread cultic act\nin the Qur’anic milieu.\nTottoli maintains that prostration was not part of established rituals of worship in the\nQur’an’s Meccan milieu (Tottoli 1998, 16). It is true that reports preserved in Islamic exeget-\n1 The remaining occurrences of r-k-ʿ are Q 2:43, which resembles 3:43 (both have the command wa- rkaʿū/\nwa- rkaʿī maʿa l- rākiʿīn), 5:55, 38:24 (David “fell down bowing and entrusted himself to God,” wa- kharra rākiʿan\nwa- anāb), and 77:48 (the deniers are told to bow yet refuse to do so, wa- idhā qīla lahumu rkaʿū lā yarkaʿūn). The\nonly Meccan occurrences of rakaʿa are Q 38:24 and 77:48. Q 77:48 may be compared to Meccan verses that either\ncommand the Qur’anic recipients to “prostrate” themselves (Q 25:60, 41:37: usjudū; 96:19: usjud) or complain\nthat they fail to do so (Q 53:62, 84:21: lā yasjudūn). This, too, heightens the impression that rakaʿa and sajada\nare closely associated and can therefore stand in for each other.\n2 On the Greek verb proskyneō, corresponding to Hebrew hishtaḥăwâ and Aramaic sged, in the Septuagint,\nthe New Testament, and outside the Bible, see TDNT 6:758–766.\n3 See also Q 53:62: fa- sjudū li- llāhi wa-ʿ budū.

The historical value of such post- Qur’anic reports is\nhowever notoriously difficult to judge, and it does not seem impossible that l ater cultural\nassumptions about the fierce pride of pre-I slamic Arabs played a role in the emergence of\nsuch material. More compelling are some relevant Qur’anic data. Thus, an early Meccan\nverse faults the Qur’an’s addressees for failing to prostrate “when the recitation is recited\nto them” (Q 84:21: wa-i dhā quriʾa ʿalayhimu l-q urʾānu lā yasjudūn), and Q 25:60 takes\nthe Qur’anic opponents to task for failing to heed the command to fall down before “the\nMerciful” (al- raḥmān) and for refusing to prostrate “to what youS”— namely, Muhammad—\n“order us to” (wa- idhā qīla lahumu sjudū li- l- raḥmāni qālū wa- mā l- raḥmānu a- nasjudu\nli- mā taʾmurunā; see Tottoli 1998, 17–18). Both verses could indicate a general aversion to\nprostration among the Qur’an’s recipients. However, they could equally well pertain to the\nrefusal of parts of the Qur’anic audience to recognise that Muhammad was transmitting di-\nvine revelations and that he possessed the authority to dispense binding doctrinal and ritual\ninstructions in the name of a supreme deity. It is not inconceivable that seemingly historical\ntraditions expanding on the aversion of Muhammad’s contemporaries to prostration are at\nleast in part narrative amplifications of t hese two Qur’anic verses.\nThere are also two passages, Q 2:125 and 22:26, that indicate that the pre- Qur’anic Kaʿbah\ncult included prostration. Q 2:125 recounts how God established the Meccan sanctuary,\nhere called “the station of Abraham” (maqām ibrāhīm), as a “place of prayer” (muṣallā),\ncommanding Abraham and his son Ishmael to “purify my house for those performing\ncircumambulation [around it], who are devoted [to it], who bow and who prostrate them-\nselves” (an ṭahhirā baytiya li- l-ṭ āʾifīna wa- l-ʿ ākifīna wa- l- rukkaʿi l- sujūd). A close variant of\nthe same divine command, albeit in the singular rather than the dual, is found in Q 22:26\n(wa-ṭ ahhir baytiya li-l -ṭ āʾifīna wa- l- qāʾimīna wa- l- rukkaʿi l- sujūd). It seems likely that both\npassages are meant to endow the rites customarily performed at the Meccan sanctuary\nwith an Abrahamic etiology rather than to stipulate novel rites. The first elem ent of this\ncultic cata logue, ritual circumambulation, certainly formed part and parcel of the rituals\ntraditionally performed at the Meccan sanctuary (see under → bayt), and this creates a\ndistinct likelihood that the same holds for prostration. Moreover, the fact that not only the\nprayer ritual of the Qur’anic community but also the rites practised by their pagan oppo-\nnents could apparently be designated by the term ṣalāh, “prayer,” lends further credence\nto the assumption that the two must have shared some relevant behavioural components,\nof which prostration may well have been one (see u nder → ṣallā). Hence, the reason why\nQ 27:24 and 41:37 (see above) envisage prostration in the context of non- monotheistic\nworship may well be that cultic prostration was practised by Muhammad’s fellow Meccans\nand did not form an alien cultic import distasteful to their dignity.\nProstration in the Qur’an. The significance of prostration in the Hebrew Bible has\nbeen held to convey a “sense of disparity” and of “absolute submission” (TDOT 4:251; see\nalso Ehrlich 2004, 45–46). Prostration to God in the Qur’an would seem to have a similar\nsignificance. Several verses employing the verb sajada explic itly contrast it with pride and\nhaughtiness, expressed by the verb istakbara (Q 2:34, 7:206, 16:49, 32:15, 38:75; see Tottoli\n1998, 28–29, and Katz 2013, 16).

Especially the\nlatter instance stands in clear tension with the vigorous ban on prostration to any human\nbeing in the ḥadīth and sīrah lit er a ture (Tottoli 1998, 23–25; Katz 2013, 17–18). This l ater\nban, which may have served to demarcate the Arab- Muslim conquerors from the customs\nof subject populations, bespeaks a more immediate equation between prostration and\nreligious veneration than found in the Qur’an itself.\nCosmic prostration. The significance that the Qur’an attaches to the act of prostra-\ntion also emerges from the way in which several Qur’anic verses expand it into a cosmic\nphenomenon (see also under → arḍ).4 The motif of cosmic prostration is already found in\nthe early Meccan verse Q 55:6, according to which “stars and trees prostrate themselves”\n(wa- l- najmu wa- l- shajaru yasjudān), namely, to God. Three later passages then generalise\nthat every thing and every one “in the heavens and on earth” are engaged in prostration\nto God (Q 13:15, 16:49, 22:18: wa-l i-l lāhi yasjudu / annā allāha yasjudu lahu man/mā fī\nl- samāwāti wa- ±​<mā fī> l- arḍi), “willingly or [literally: and] by force” (Q 13:15: ṭawʿan\nwa-k arhan). One of these three verses, Q 22:18, adds an illustrative list of the entities\nconcerned, which harks back to Q 55:6: “the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains,\nthe trees, the land animals, and many h umans; and many [other h umans] have become\nliable to punishment (wa- kathīrun ḥaqqa ʿalayhi l- ʿadhābu).” Q 16:48, which immediately\nprecedes one of the verses just referenced, ofers the movement of shadows as evidence\nof the phenomenon of cosmic prostration (cf. also Q 13:15): “Have they not looked at the\nthings that God has created, whose shadows move to the right and to the left, humbly\nprostrating themselves to God (yatafayyaʾu ẓilāluhu ʿani l- yamīni wa- l- shamāʾili sujjadan\nli- llāhi wa-h um dākhirūn)?” Not every thing that exists casts a shadow, of course, which\nmeans that Q 16:48 is best read as providing a mere indication, rather than a comprehensive\ndefinition, of what the prostration of all things to God consists in. The larger point made\nmust be that every thing is subject to God’s power and sway. This reading is confirmed by\nthe fact that an equivalent cosmic dimension, expressed in similar phraseology, is also\ngiven to the act of praising God, where the movement of shadows obviously does not\nenter into the issue: “everything/everyone in the heavens and on earth glorifies (sabbaḥa)\nGod” (Q 24:41, 57:1, 59:1.24, 61:1, 62:1, 64:1: sabbaḥa/yusabbiḥu li- llāhi/lahu man/mā fī\nl-s amāwāti wa-m ā fī l-a rḍi / wa-l -a rḍi; see also 17:44; → ḥamd). A third verb that is used\nin a similar phraseological context is → aslama, “to surrender oneself”: “every one in the\nheavens and on earth surrender themselves to him, willingly or by force, and to him will\nthey be returned” (Q 3:83).\nThe rider “willingly or by force” (ṭawʿan wa- karhan) in Q 13:15 and also in 3:83 is clearly\ndesigned to take note of the fact that some of God’s creatures— namely, humans and also\nthe → jinn— are endowed with the ability to make moral and religious choices and may\naccordingly refuse to prostrate themselves, just as Iblīs refused to prostrate himself when\ncommanded by God (see u nder → shayṭān).

However, as Q 19:93 puts it, “ There is\nnone in the heavens and on earth who does not come [or perhaps who w ill not come] to\nthe Merciful as a servant” (in kullu man fī l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍi illā ātī l- raḥmāni ʿabdā).5\nWe may connect the dots by saying that those humans who refuse to prostrate to God\nvoluntarily (ṭawʿan) will be reduced to submission by force (karhan), when confronted\nby divine judgement and retribution.6 What is perhaps most in ter est ing in the pre sent\ncontext is the implication that a believer who practices prostration in prayer consciously\nand voluntarily (ṭawʿan) enacts, appropriates, and assents to the world’s universal and\ninevitable subordination to its creator. The believer’s act of prostration is therefore em-\nbedded in a total cosmic context that sim ult an eously underscores h umans’ integration into\na world created and ruled by God and their special status as creatures who are capable of\nunderstanding and consenting to God’s dominion.\nThe noun masjid, “place of prostration.” One of the two chief Qur’anic designations\nof the Meccan sanctuary, apart from “the house” (→ al-b ayt), is “the sacred place of\nprostration” (al-m asjid al- ḥarām; → ḥarrama). The expression is prevalent in Medinan\npassages (Q 2:144.149.150.191.196.217, 5:2, 8:34, 9:7.19.28, 22:25, 48:25.27) and occurs only\nonce in a Meccan surah: according to Q 17:1, God “made his servant”— i.e., Muhammad—\n“travel by night from the sacred place of prostration to the distant place of prostration\nwhose environs we have blessed” (asrā bi-ʿ abdihi laylan mina l-m asjidi l-ḥ arāmi ilā l- masjid\nal-a qṣā lladhī bāraknā ḥawlahu). The contextually most convincing identification of the\ndestination of this nocturnal translation is to equate it with the Israelite masjid mentioned\nin v. 7 and to identify both with the Jerusalem temple (see also SPMC 227–232, 239).\nApart from the expression al-m asjid al- ḥarām, the Qur’an employs masjid as a common\nnoun in the general sense of a site of prayer or worship (FVQ 264).7 For example, Q 72:18\nmaintains that “places of prostration belong to God; so do not invoke anyone else together\nwith God” (wa-a nna l-m asājida li-l lāhi fa-l ā tadʿū maʿa llāhi aḥadā), and the same generic\nusage is seen in further Meccan and Medinan verses (Meccan: Q 7:29.31, 18:21; Medinan:\n2:114.187, 9:17.107–108, 22:40).8 Consequently, what Q 17:1 implies by referring to the\nMeccan Kaʿbah and the Jerusalem temple as the “sacred place of prostration” and the\n“distant place of prostration” is that the two are members, albeit particularly eminent\nones, of a wider set of human ritual sites.9 Q 72:18 factually presupposes that such sites\nof prayer of prostration may or may not be devoted to the supreme creator god Allāh.\nHence, just as there is reason to assume that in the Qur’anic milieu prostration was by\nno means alien to pagan rituals, so the word masjid would seem to have been in use for\npagan ritual sites.\n5 The specific context here is a refutation of the claim that God might have ofspring.\n6 But see the early Meccan verse Q 68:42: on the day of judgement the unbelievers will be called to\nprostrate themselves to God, and will presumably be very much minded to oblige, yet “they are unable to do\nso.” As the following verse makes clear, the point is that they have missed their chance to worship God when\nthere was still time.\n7 One Medinan verse, Q 2:125, would seem to employ the term muṣallā, derived from the verb → ṣallā, in\nroughly the same meaning; but masjid is certainly far more frequent in this sense.\n8 On Q 2:114, see n. 27 under → arḍ.\n9 In addition, the diction of Q 17:1 suggests a close link between Mecca and Jerusalem, which is further\ndeveloped in the Medinan surahs (HCI 205–206).\nsajada 385", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Seeing that the expres-\nsion al-m asjid al- ḥarām is only found in a single Meccan passage, should we deem it a\ncoinage that is original to the Qur’an? On this hypothesis, the expression would have been\nemployed for the first time in Q 17:1, with a view to putting the Meccan sanctuary on a\npar with the Jerusalem temple, and would only subsequently, in the Medinan period, have\ngone on to impose itself as a standard designation by which the Qur’anic believers referred\nto the sanctuary to which they laid claim against the pagan Meccans. By contrast, the gen-\neral pre- Islamic name for the Meccan sanctuary would have been “the house” or “God’s\nhouse,” which are documented by pre-I slamic poetry (see Sinai 2019b, 52–54, and → bayt;\nsee also the Meccan passages Q 14:37, 52:4, 106:3). Against this conjecture stands a verse\nby the pagan Medinan poet Qays ibn al- Khaṭīm, reportedly killed in 620 CE, who swears\n“by God, of the sacred place of prostration” (Kowalski 1914, no. 5:14: wa- llāhi dhī l- masjidi\nl-ḥ arāmi, KU 140–141).10 A single attestation is however not above suspicion of being a l ater\naccretion drawing on Qur’anic diction. Hence, short of identifying further occurrences\nof al- masjid al-ḥ arām in the early poetic rec ord, one may prefer to remain agnostic as to\nwhether or not the expression was indeed in use prior to the Qur’an.\nA higher degree of confidence is warranted with regard to the Qur’an’s employment of\nmasjid as a common noun, which certainly reflects a well- established manner of referring\nto cultic sites via the act of prostration. In the Damascus Document (11:21) discovered at\nQumran, the Hebrew expression bēt hishtaḥwut, literally “house of prostration,” is used\nfor the “designated gathering place for divine worship, a name evidently derived from the\ndominant ritual posture in this setting” (Ehrlich 2004, 39; see also Nitzan 1994, 62–63).\nThe Aramaic counterpart of the phrase, bet sigda, refers to Midianite shrines in Targum\nOnqelos on Num 31:10 (DTTM 953). Even closer to the Qur’anic term masjid, Nabataean\ninscriptions and Jewish Aramaic papyri employ the word msgdʾ (masgda) in the general\nsense of a place of worship or of an altar or monument that has been erected at such a\nplace (Schwally 1899, 134; KU 141; FVQ 263; Nebe 1991, 239–241; Robin 2003, 121, n. 129).\nThe Aramaic term was also loaned into South Arabian (Nebe 1991; Robin 2000, 57; Robin\n2003, 121), further confirming its circulation in pre- Islamic Arabia.\nsijjīn | Sijjīn\n→ zaqqūm\nsāḥir | sorcerer\n→ jinn\nsakhkhara tr.

In nine verses, almost all of them Meccan, the preaching of the Qur’anic Mes-\nsenger, especially the idea of an eschatological resurrection, is dismissed by his adversaries\nor by some figure representing them as being mere “asāṭīr of the ancients (al-a wwalīn)”\n(Q 6:25, 8:31, 16:24, 23:83, 25:5, 27:68, 46:17, 68:15, 83:13).1 Asāṭīr is clearly an internal\nplural, even if the corresponding singular is unattested in the Qur’an. The force of the\nobjection is, first, that the Messenger’s preaching rehashes familiar content devoid of any\ninformational novelty, as illustrated by Q 23:83 and 27:68: “we and our forefathers have\nreceived this pledge before” (la- qad wuʿidnā ±​<hādhā> naḥnu wa-ā bāʾunā ±​<hādhā> min\nqablu). This content is, secondly, dismissed as false. Thus, in Q 46:11 the unbelievers or\nrepudiators would seem to use the expression “an old lie” (ifk qadīm) in approximately the\nsame sense as asāṭīr al-a wwalīn (QP 137), and in Q 25:4 the accusation that the Messenger\nis relaying lies (ifk) occurs immediately before one of the asāṭīr al-a wwalīn statements\njust referenced.2 All of this ties in with the opponents’ allegations elsewhere that the\nMessenger has “fabricated” (iftarā) the Qur’anic revelations (e.g., Q 10:38, 11:13; see also\nunder → jinn).\nThe root s-ṭ - r and the idea of writing. The word asāṭīr itself likely connotes the idea\nof writing, given that the first- form verb saṭara (Q 68:1) and the participles masṭūr and\nmustaṭar (Q 17:58, 33:6, 54:53; see also 52:2) mean “to write” and “written down.” That\n1 On awwal, see under → ākhir as well as the remarks on al-m illah al-ā khirah (“con temporary religious\nteaching or belief”) under → millah.\n2 For a further verse in which the Messenger is accused of disseminating ifk, see Q 34:43.\nasāṭīr al- awwalīn 387", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It may be that Qur’anic asāṭīr\nis related to Aramaic/Syriac shṭārā, “deed, writ, document” (see GQ 1:16; KU 69–70; FVQ\n56–57; KK 137; for the Aramaic and Syriac terms, see DJBA 1130 and SL 1549). Overall,\nasāṭīr al- awwalīn is perhaps best rendered as “writs of the ancients” or, to bring out its\npejorative force, as “ancient scribblings” (cf. Nöldeke 1860, 13, who proposes Geschreibsel).\nWriting and authority. Following Horovitz (KU 70) it may be noted that asāṭīr al-\nawwalīn has a degree of semantic affinity with two other Qur’anic expressions, namely:\nzubur (singular: → zabūr) al- awwalīn, “the writings of the ancients,” which according to\nQ 26:196 contain the same message as the revelations vouchsafed to Muhammad, and the syn-\nonymous expression al-ṣ uḥuf al-ū lā, “ancient writings,” which figures in Q 20:133 and 87:18–\n19 (cf. also the reference to ṣuḥuf mūsā in Q 53:36; for more on ṣuḥuf, see u nder → kitāb).\nAll three phrases evoke the idea of writing, designated by one of the roots s-ṭ - r, z- b- r, or\nṣ-ḥ - f, and the notion of being ancient, which is in all three cases expressed by the adjective\nawwal. Nonetheless, the rhetorical valence of asāṭīr al- awwalīn is diametrically opposed\nto that of zubur al- awwalīn and al-ṣ uḥuf al-ū lā: When the Qur’an’s own voice maintains\nthat Muhammad’s revelations are contained in or agree with the ancient ṣuḥuf and zubur,\nthis presumes that the Qur’an’s accord with e arlier scriptures indicates its authority and\ntrustworthiness; scripturality is viewed as a hallmark of revelatory status. By contrast,\nwhen the Qur’anic opponents deploy the expression asāṭīr al- awwalīn, they understand\nwritten knowledge to be something that is readily available and therefore apt to be copied\nand parroted—as the Qur’anic adversaries put it in Q 8:31, “If we wanted (law nashāʾu), we\ncould say something like it.” The Meccan surahs thus aford us glimpses of two very dif er-\nent appraisals of writing that w ere pre sent in the Qur’anic milieu. Moreover, t hese dif ere nt\nstances t owards the authority of writing are couched in distinctive diction: the expression\nasāṭīr al- awwalīn is always attributed to opponents and never employed by the Qur’an’s\nown voice. It seems that at least in this case the Qur’an preserves an accurate impression\nof the language characteristic of its antagonists rather than reformulating their objections\nand attacks in Qur’anic terminology (which may be the case elsewhere).\nIt is worth adding that the preceding contrast between two opposing attitudes to\nthe authoritativeness of written transmission is not invalidated by Q 74:52, where the\nQur’anic voice complains that “every one of them”— i.e., all those who turn away from\nthe Qur’anic proclamations (v. 49)—“ demands to be given sheets of writing (ṣuḥuf) spread\nout” (bal yurīdu kullu mriʾin minhum an yuʾtā ṣuḥufan munashsharah). The verse could mean\nthat Muhammad’s adversaries demanded textual proof for the assertion made in Q 87:18–19\nthat “this”— namely, the eschatological kerygma preached by Muhammad—“ is in the ancient\nwritings (al-ṣ uḥuf al-ū lā) // the writings of Abraham and Moses.” Alternatively, as noted by\nNeuwirth (PP 372), Q 74:52 could be saying that Muhammad’s opponents are refusing to\nbelieve u ntil they have witnessed the Qur’an’s announcements of an eschatological resurrec-\n3 The accusation that the Messenger is drawing on h uman sources is also articulated, in dif er ent language,\nin Q 6:105, 16:103, 25:4, and 44:14 (see also 29:48).\n388 asāṭīr al- awwalīn", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The verse does not, therefore, show that the Qur’anic\nopponents w ere themselves inclined to accept scriptural documents as truly authoritative,\nand it does not call into doubt the rather contemptuous attitude to the probative force of\nwritten tradition that comes through in the asāṭīr al- awwalīn passages.5\nThe Qur’anic opponents’ familiarity with eschatological ideas. Perhaps the\nmost impor tant observation to be derived from the asāṭīr al-a wwalīn verses is that\nthey clearly show the Qur’an’s Meccan opponents, the so- called “associators” (al-\nmushrikūn; → ashraka), to have been familiar with the notion of an eschatological resur-\nrection (see also QP 136–137): “We and our forefathers have received this pledge before; it is\nnothing but ancient scribblings,” Muhammad’s adversaries are quoted as saying in Q 23:83\nand 27:68. Incidentally, the Qur’anic opponents’ recourse to the term “ancient scribblings”\nimplies only that they considered the doctrine of an eschatological resurrection, and per-\nhaps also other aspects of the Qur’anic kerygma, to be contained and transmitted in written\ndocuments, not that they themselves had direct access to such documents. Thus, it may\nwell be the case that their understanding of what was contained in the ancient scriptural\ncorpora to which they were alluding was mediated orally. It could, for instance, have been\nderived from Christian missionary preaching.\nA potential objection to the hypothesis that the Qur’anic opponents were broadly\nfamiliar with core aspects of Judaeo- Christian eschatology and of Biblical history arises\nfrom Q 11:49, which is thematically relevant to the preceding discussion even if it does not\nmention the asāṭīr al- awwalīn. The verse closes a narrative cycle that includes, among other\nstories, an account of Noah’s flood, and it declares that the preceding “belongs to the tidings\nof the hidden that we convey to youS; you had no previous knowledge of them, neither you nor\nyour people” (tilka min anbāʾi l-g haybi nūḥīhā ilayka mā kunta taʿlamuhā anta wa- lā qaw-\nmuka min qabli hādhā).6 The statement could be taken to entail that Qur’anic narratives\nabout Biblical protagonists like Noah or Moses were furnishing the Qur’anic Messenger\nand his hearers with genuinely novel and hitherto unavailable information. This would\nof course not strictly speaking contradict the claim, derived from the asāṭīr al-a wwalīn\npassages, that the Qur’anic recipients w ere familiar with the idea of an eschatological res-\nurrection; but one would expect acquaintance with ele ments of Jewish and Christian\neschatology and acquaintance with the rudiments of Biblical history to go hand in hand.\nHowever, the literal reading of Q 11:49 just set out is overall improbable. After all, early\nQur’anic references to such Biblical figures are extremely allusive (e.g., Q 79:15–26, 85:17–18)\nand require their audience to possess significant background knowledge in order to be\nintelligible at all. A more likely interpretation of Q 11:49, therefore, is that the Messenger\n4 A third option, suggested to me by Mohsen Goudarzi, is that the opponents demanded that Muhammad\nretrieve a book from heaven (a challenge explic itly documented in Q 17:93) rather than merely delivering\nspeeches.\n5 See also Q 68:37, which poses to the Qur’anic opponents the rhetorical question whether they have “a\nscripture in which you study” (am lakum kitābun fīhi tadrusūn). The answer presupposed here is evidently\nnegative.\n6 On the anaphoric use of tilka in this verse, see under → dhālika.\nasāṭīr al- awwalīn 389", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This too supports the understanding that “the\nsakīnah” or God’s sakīnah in Q 48:4 and its parallels refers to a divinely wrought allaying\nof fear pertaining to some external threat.\nThe sixth occurrence of the word sakīnah comes at Q 2:248, according to which the Isra-\nelite “ark” (al- tābūt; see FVQ 88–89) contained “a sakīnah from yourp Lord.” H ere, too, it is\nat least feasible to read the word in the sense of an inward state of fortification, in so far as the\nark, which is expressly called a divine “sign” of Saul’s royal authority, assuages the Israelites’\ndoubts about God’s appointment of a king who is devoid of wealth (Q 2:247).\nOrigin of the word. Etymologically, the word is descended from rabbinic Hebrew\nshәkinah or its Aramaic equivalent (WMJA 53–55; NB 24–25; JPND 208–209; CQ 21; FVQ\n174; Stewart 2021, 42–54), which in targumic and rabbinic texts designate God’s “dwell-\ning” or “presence” in the world and can on occasion appear as a downright hypostasis of\nthe deity (see DTTM 1573 and DJBA 1145 as well as the overview in Unterman et al. 2007).\nThe Qur’anic use of sakīnah, a word that was presumably adopted from the language of\nthe Medinan Jews, is an evident case in which the semantics of a loanword underwent far-\nreaching adjustment in accordance with the meaning of its Arabic root s- k- n, conveying\nrest and calmness. As a result, the Qur’anic sakīnah, though explic itly identified as being\nGod’s, has a distinctly psychological slant and does not convey the presence of God at a\npar tic ul ar place, as does the rabbinic concept (Durie 2018, 178–179). One may surmise that\nthe Jews of Medina employed the word sakīnah to describe God’s presence in the ark of the\ncovenant (Q 2:248). This would be in line with God’s statement in Exod 25:8 that he w ill\n“dwell” in the Israelites’ sanctuary, which the Targum Onqelos renders, “And I s hall cause\nmy presence (shkinti) to dwell among them.” The Qur’an, by contrast, integrates the term\ninto the theme of God’s reassuring impact on the believers’ hearts, into which the sakīnah\nis sent down according to Q 48:4 (see AHW 67 and u nder → qalb). Thus, while the con-\ncept’s original doctrinal context was a theology of God’s presence at par tic ul ar places and\ntimes (see Durie 2018, 179), in its Qur’anic reception it is absorbed into what one might call\nthe Islamic scripture’s theology of divine fortification: the prime arena in which God can\nbe experienced as pre sent, above and beyond his universal role as the world’s creator and\nsustainer (→ khalaqa), is the h uman heart.\nmiskīn | indigent\n→ zakāh\nsulṭān | authority\nFurther vocabulary discussed: arsala tr. | to send s.o. a l- shayṭān | the devil, Satan\nOverview of Qur’anic usage.

The Qur’an appears to envisage two principal forms\nthat such authority might take: either a divinely inspired scriptural corpus from which\none might discern God’s will (Q 37:156–157, 54:43, 68:37–38) or a God- given ability to\nperform evidentiary miracles of the sort vouchsafed to Moses (Q 4:153, 11:96, 23:45,\n28:35, 40:23, 44:19, 51:38). A slightly dif er ent sort of authoritative knowledge is hypo-\nthetically posited in Q 52:38, which asks whether the Qur’anic adversaries dispose of a\n“ladder on which they can listen,” i.e., a means of ascending to heaven and becoming\nprivy to divine secrets (on ascent into heaven, see also under → nazzala). If so, the verse\ncontinues, “let anyone among them who is able to listen bring clear authority” (fa-l -y aʾti\nmustamiʿuhum bi-s ulṭānin mubīn).1\nOverall, the Qur’an pre sents authority, sulṭān, as a divinely bestowed attribute of God’s\nmessengers (DTEK 83–84), even though this God- given authority may be doubted by their\nopponents (Q 14:10). As intimated above, it is especially with regard to Moses that the\nQur’an repeatedly stresses that he was sent (arsala) with God’s authority (Q 11:96, 23:45,\n40:23, 51:38; see also 4:153; see also the discussion of confirmatory miracles u nder → āyah).\nThe Qur’an recognises that “authority” is also a feature of human and this- worldly h uman\nrelationships, as implied by Q 69:29, where a paradigmatic eschatological convict bewails\nthe fact that “my authority has perished” (halaka ʿannī sulṭāniyah). Ultimately, though,\nit appears that legitimate authority must be granted by God: even the right of blood ven-\ngeance for those killed unjustly is described as an authority or right bestowed by the\ndeity (Q 17:33: wa- man qutila maẓlūman fa- qad jaʿalnā li- waliyyihi sulṭānan). This is also\nconfirmed by another context in which the concept of authority comes up, namely, af-\nfirmations to the efect that the devil has no authority over God’s “elect servants” (see\nunder → shayṭān).\nChristian antecedent. The Qur’an’s widespread deployment of the concept of “author-\nity,” sulṭān, is a development of the New Testamental notion of exousia, which is given to\nJesus and distinguishes him from mere scribes (Matt 7:29; see also, e.g., Matt 9:6.8, 10:1,\n28:18). In its ordinary Greek usage, the word exousia has been glossed as meaning “the\npossibility granted by a higher norm or court, and therefore ‘the right to do something\nor the right over something’ ” (TDNT 2:562), making “authority” a generally fitting trans-\nlation. In Matt 21:23.24.27, the chief priests and the elders demand to know by whose\nauthority Jesus is working miracles, just as God’s messengers in the Qur’an are challenged\nto evidence their authority (Q 14:10–11). Exousia is normally translated as shūlṭānā in the\nSyriac Peshitta (Matt 7:29 has mshallṭā, “someone given authority”), from which Arabic\nsulṭān is etymologically derived (FVQ 176–177; see also NB 39). In a Safaitic inscription\n(LP 1013), s1lṭn may refer to the settled “authorities” from which a writer hopes to be safe\n(Al- Jallad 2015a, 271 and 342). This confirms that the Arabic word predates the Qur’an by\na considerable time, even if the Qur’anic use is imbued by religious connotations that are\nabsent from the Safaitic attestation.\n1 On the adjective mubīn, see under → bayyana.\n392 sulṭān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Fi nally, I turn to the noun islām and the question whether the Medinan surahs\nemploy it to identify a par tic u lar religion that is distinct both from pagan polytheism, on\nthe one hand, and from Judaism and Chris tian ity, on the other.\nThe basic meaning of aslama: “to hand over, give up, surrender.” The lexicographical\nsources assert that aslama (as well as the second- form verb sallama), when used transi-\ntively, can mean “to give up, hand over, deliver s.th. or s.o. to (li-) s.o.” (AEL 1412–1413;\nsee also al-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī 2009, 423, where aslamtu l-s hayʾa ilā fulānin is glossed as\nakhrajtuhu ilayhi).1 More importantly, this signification of aslama is satisfactorily docu-\nmented in pre- Islamic poetry (Margoliouth 1903, 470–472; Lyall 1903, 781–782; Ringgren\n1949, 13–17). Thus, a poem by Zuhayr describes a falling bucket as being “abandoned by\nthe rope” (aslamahā l- rishāʾ; DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 1:21; see AEL 1413; Lyall 1903, 781–782;\na variant use of the meta phor is quoted in Ringgren 1949, 16), and a brief piece attributed\nto Ṭarafah complains that “a/my p eople have abandoned me” (aslamanī qawmun/qawmī;\nDSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 2:1; cf. also Lyall 1903, 782). Elsewhere in the Zuhayr corpus, aslama\nforms a synonymous parallelism with khadhala, “to forsake, leave, desert” (DSAAP,\nZuhayr, no. 15:29).2 Ringgren lists a number of cases in which aslama occurs not only with\nan accusative object, denoting the object or person being handed over or given up, but\nalso with a prepositional object introduced by li- and denoting the recipient (Ringgren\n1949, 14; e.g., Farrāj and Shākir 1963–1965, 1208 = Abū Khirāsh, no. 5:2, where the poet is\nhanded over or surrendered to the grave). The basic transitive meaning aslama = “to give\nup, hand over s.th. or s.o.” persists in post- Qur’anic Arabic. It is evident, for example, in\na panegyric on ʿAbd Allāh ibn al- Zubayr by the Hudhalī poet Abū Dhuʾayb (d. a fter 647;\nsee Sezgin 1975, 255–256), who states that “my heart rebelled against me [presumably, by\nremaining attached to his distant beloved], so I abandoned it” (ʿaṣānī l- fuʾādu fa- aslamtuhu,\nthe latter word being glossed as khallaytuhu wa- taraktuhu; Farrāj and Shākir 1963–1965,\n196, no. 25:2; see Ringgren 1949, 16).\nIt has been conjectured that aslama in the sense of handing over or giving up someone\nor something may derive from Aramaic ashlem (KU 55; see also Ringgren 1949, 32; for\nashlem in Syriac and Jewish Babylonian Aramaic, refer to SL 1567 and DJBA 1151; for an\ninner- Arabic derivation, see Lyall 1903, 781). But the loan, if it is one, must be very old:\nthe verb under discussion is already found in a Safaitic inscription in which ʾs¹lm has been\ninterpreted to mean “he surrendered,” in the sense of “he gave himself up” (see Al- Jallad\n2015a, 251 = HCH 194).3\n1 Ringgren 1949, 7, and Bravmann 1972, 19, observe that the Qur’an occasionally employs sallama syn-\nonymously with aslama (see Q 4:65, 33:22). But in both cases, taslīmā is the final word of the verse, meaning\nthat these could be cases of poetic licence due to rhyme. On the other hand, as Mohsen Goudarzi points out to\nme, the Qur’an does not refrain from combining verbs and nouns that belong to dif er ent forms, thus tabattal\nilayhi tabtīlā at Q 73:8. Hence, Q 4:65 could conceivably have run wa-y uslimū taslīmā rather than wa-y usallimū\ntaslīmā. The rasm is of course undistinguishable anyway.\n2 Bravmann 1972, 11–12, adduces yet another verse by Zuhayr that praises the addressee for “delivering\n[yourself] up” or “abandoning [yourself]” in battle (mā aslamta fī l- najadāti; DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 4:20). How-\never, Bravmann’s construal presupposes a textual variant (see DSAAP, 39, according to Eu ro pean pagination),\nand Bravmann’s translation itself is also open to doubt (Ringgren 1949, 20).\n3 In this inscription, ʾs1lm occurs between the verbs nfr, “he fled,” and ʾflt, “he escaped,” yielding a likely se-\nquence consisting in an unsuccessful attempt to escape followed by surrender and subsequent escape.

What may seem the most con ve nient point of departure for\nascertaining the meaning of aslama in the Islamic scripture are four verses in which aslama\ngoverns the direct object wajh + possessive pronoun, “one’s face,” and is followed by the\nprepositional complement li-l lāh, “to God” (Q 2:112, 3:20, 4:125) or ilā llāh (Q 31:22).\nIn view of the evidence marshalled in the preceding section, the standard translation of\naslama wajhahu li-l lāh (of which ilā llāh in Q 31:22 is prob ably a variant, notwithstanding\nBravmann 1972, 23) as “to surrender one’s face to God” is a defensible, albeit very literal,\nstarting point. As we shall see below, the attitude described may be characterised as a\nstance of total acquiescence in God’s will and of complete devotion or dedication to the\ndeity; but for the time being, we are still concerned with linguistic surface meaning and\ntranslational considerations rather than with the under lying concept.\nAs regards the accusative object wajhahu (“his face”), Bravmann maintains that early\nArabic can use wajh interchangeably with nafs, signifying the h uman self (Bravmann 1972,\n22–23; Bravmann 1977, 434–438; see also Künstlinger 1935, 137, and Ringgren 1949, 22–23).\nThe same view is already put forward, e.g., in al-M āturīdī’s treatment of Q 2:112 (al-M āturīdī\n2005–2007, 1:211–212), where aslama wajhahu is paraphrased as aslama nafsahu.5 Bravmann’s\nequation of wajh with nafs is however open to question, both on account of some of the\npoetic prooftexts concerned and b ecause it is doubtful w hether wajh + possessive suffix is\nanywhere e lse in the Qur’an synonymous with nafs + possessive suffix (Baneth 1971, 187–188).\nIn fact, nafs as a reflexive pronoun is well attested in the Qur’anic corpus (e.g., → ˻ẓalama\nnafsahu, “to wrong o.s.” in Q 2:54.57.231, 3:117.135, 4:64.110, 16:118 etc., → ˻sharā nafsahu,\n“to sell o.s.” in 2:102.207, qatalū anfusahum, “to kill one another,” in 2:54.85 and 4:29.66,6\nand ḥarrama ʿalā nafsihi, “to forbid s.th. to o.s.,” in 3:93; → nafs). Th ere is consequently no\nreason why the verb aslama too should not have been conjoined with nafs rather than wajh\nhad the intended meaning been simply “to surrender oneself.” Reflexive uses of wajh, by\ncontrast, e ither have a literal significance (e.g., Q 51:29: fa-ṣ akkat wajhahā, “she hit herself\nin the face”; 5:6: fa- ghsilū wujūhakum, “wash yourp f aces”; 2:144.149.150.177: walli wajhaka /\nwallū wujūhakum, “turn yourS face / yourp f aces”) or, alternatively, deploy wajh in a meta-\nphorical function in which the word’s basic anatomical significance is nonetheless clearly\nand meaningfully apparent (e.g., Q 6:79, where Abraham says, innī wajjahtu wajhiya li-l ladhī\nfaṭara l- samāwāti wa- l- arḍa, “I hereby turn my face to the creator of the heavens and the\nearth”; 30:43: aqim wajhaka li- l- dīni l- qayyimi, “set your face t owards the right religion”;\n10:105 and 30:30 have the variant aqim wajhaka li- l- dīni ḥanīfan).\nto Al- Jallad, ʾflt is preceded by w- bʿd, “and afterwards.” See also http:// krc. orient. ox. ac. uk/ ociana/ corpus/ pages\n/ OCIANA _ 0003047 . html (accessed 6 November 2021).\n4 See OED Online, s.v. “surrender, v.,” https:// www . oed . com (accessed 14 February 2020).\n5 Al-M āturīdī justifies the claim that “the face (al- wajh) may be mentioned in the sense of the self (al- dhāt)”\nby reference to Q 28:88: “Every thing will perish except for his”— namely, God’s— “face” (wajh). But this is not a\nconclusive prooftext, because its probative force is anchored in the questionable presupposition that God, being\nimmaterial, could not literally have a countenance (→ allāh).\n6 Cf.

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:418", "title": "Page 418", "locator": "pdf_page:418", "text": "There is, accordingly, a strong case for rendering aslama wajhahu in such a way as to\nsignal that the accusative object’s literal meaning is “one’s face” rather than simply turning\nit into a general reflexive (“oneself”). The phrase aslama wajhahu evokes the submissive or\ntrusting exposure of a vulnerable body part that is emblematic of personal identity, which\nreceives further support from the explicit reference to facing God in Q 6:79, just cited. It\nis significant that God too is Qur’anically described as possessing a face that humans can\nseek out (e.g., Q 2:272, 92:20; → allāh). An impor tant connotation of Qur’anic references\nto the countenance of God and of humans may therefore be their ability to countenance\neach other (see especially Q 75:22–23: “ There will be faces on that day that are radiant, //\ngazing upon their Lord”). In fact, a few verses on from Q 2:112, one of the occurrences of\naslama wajhahu li-l lāhi cited above, it is said that “wherever youp turn, there is the face\nof God” (Q 2:115: fa- aynamā tuwallū fa- thamma wajhu llāhi). Despite all of this, however,\n“to surrender one’s face” is hardly very idiomatic En glish. The best solution may therefore\nbe to render aslama wajhahu li- llāhi in a slightly paraphrastic manner as “to face God\nin self- surrender,” which efectively understands the phrase to combine the idea of self-\nsurrender to God, to be discussed further below, with that of facing (wajjaha wajhahu li-)\nGod. This is essentially to adopt Horovitz’s view that aslama wajhahu ilā llāh / li- llāh is to\nbe explained as resulting from a “contamination” with wajjaha wajhahu li- at Q 6:79 and\nwith other phraseology evoking the turning of the human face (KU 54). If this is correct,\nthen occurrences of aslama without an explicit accusative object should not be considered\nto be abbreviations of aslama wajhahu. Having thus gotten aslama wajhahu out of the way,\nit is to such object- less instances of aslama that we must turn in the next section.\nAslama without accusative object as implicitly reflexive. The four Qur’anic verses just\nexamined, in which aslama is accompanied by the accusative object wajhahu, are dwarfed\nby numerous instances in which aslama or its active participle muslim are used intransi-\ntively, i.e., lack a direct accusative object. Such intransitive occurrences encompass both\ncases in which aslama, though not governing a direct object, occurs with the preposition\nli-, followed by a designation of God (2:128.131.133.136, 3:83.84, 6:71, 22:34, 27:44, 29:46,\n39:54, 40:66), and cases in which aslama or muslim are used absolutely, without any direct\nor prepositional object at all (e.g., Q 2:132, 3:52.64.80 e tc., 5:111, 6:14, 7:126, 10:84, 16:81,\n37:103; for two particularly early cases, see 51:36 and 68:35). Should the transitive meaning\nof aslama that is indisputably pre sent in Q 2:112, 3:20, 4:125, and 31:22 be assumed to extend\nto such intransitive cases? In other words, should we treat absolute aslama and aslama li-\nwithout an accusative object (e.g., Q 6:71: umirnā li- nuslima li- rabbi l-ʿ ālamīn) as an elliptical\nequivalent of aslama nafsahu li- (thus, e.g., Bravmann 1972, 13)?\nIt is not self- evident that the answer to this question must be affirmative. For instance,\nMark Lidzbarski holds that the Qur’an’s frequent occurrences of absolute aslama reflect a\nmore archaic usage in which aslama derived from → salām, understood to be an equivalent\nof Greek sōtēria, “salvation,” and consequently functioned as an intransitive verb like aṣbaḥa\n(“to enter upon the time of morning”) or aḥrama (“to enter upon the sacred state of a pil-\ngrim”). Intransitive aslama would consequently mean something like “to enter upon the\nstate of salvation” (Lizdbarski 1922).7 A more recent intervention questioning an elliptical\nconstrual of absolute aslama is Juan Cole’s proposition, based on an idea first suggested by\n7 For a brief refutation of Lidzbarski’s thesis, see Ringgren 1949, 4.

By way of a linguistic parallel, Cole points to the\nsemantic gap that obtains in En glish between s imple transitive verbs (e.g., “to drop s.th.”)\nand phrasal verbs (e.g., “to drop in on a friend”; Cole 2019, 407).\nYet the simplest solution remains nonetheless to assume a basic unity of meaning across\nall Qur’anic occurrences of aslama or muslim.8 From this perspective, the basic signifi-\ncance of aslama is one and the same in all three categories of Qur’anic usage previously\nregistered, namely:\n(i) explic itly transitive occurrences, such as man yuslim wajhahu ilā llāhi (“whoever\nsurrenders his face to God”) at Q 31:22;\n(ii) statements like umirnā li- nuslima li- rabbi l- ʿālamīn (Q 6:71; “We have been com-\nmanded to surrender ourselves to the Lord of the world- dwellers”), where aslama\nis accompanied by a prepositional object but not by an accusative one; and\n(iii) assertions like qul innī umirtu an akūna awwala man aslama (Q 6:14; “Say, ‘I have\nbeen commanded to be the first of those who surrender themselves [to God]’ ”),\nwhere aslama occurs absolutely, i.e., neither with an accusative object nor with a\nprepositional one.\nThe supposition of a unitary significance of aslama across all three of these categories is\nbuttressed by the fact that absolute aslama (category [iii] above) and aslama li- (category\n[ii] above) sometimes occur in similar phraseological contexts, as illustrated by the two\nverses just quoted from Surah 6, and by further passages in which it is contextually cer-\ntain that absolute aslama can indeed function as an ellipsis for aslama li- , to wit, Q 2:131\n(“When his Lord said to him: ‘aslim’, and he said: ‘aslamtu to the Lord of the world-\ndwellers’ ”) and 3:20 (where the Messenger is first commanded to say, “aslamtu my face\nto the Lord of the world- dwellers,” and then to ask the scripture- owners, “aslamtum?”;\n“and if they aslamū, they are guided”). Moreover, if at least aslama li- (category [ii] above)\nis to be understood in the customary sense of surrendering, devoting, or submitting one-\nself to God (thus treating it as elliptical), which Cole accepts, then one will in princi ple\nneed to recognise an occasional need for tacitly supplementing the verb with some kind\nof reflexive object where such an object is not explic itly pre sent. Hence, the decision to\nunderstand absolute aslama in a dif er ent vein than aslama li- and aslama wajhahu li-\ncannot be justified by dismissing such an elliptical construal as generally invalid. Indeed,\nalready the Safaitic inscription adduced above confronts us with just such an ellipsis.\nFi nally, a construal of aslama without an explicit accusative object as “implicitly reflexive”\n(Larcher 2020, 116–117, 126, 138) is supported by the cases of → āmana bi- , “to believe\nin,” → kadhdhaba bi- , “to dismiss as a lie,” and → kafara bi- , “to repudiate,” all three of\n8 Cole 2019 discusses a number of Qur’anic passages for which he maintains that the standard translation\naslama = “to surrender” yields interpretive difficulties (e.g., Q 39:22 and 61:6, discussed in Cole 2019, 407 and\n415–416), but I am not persuaded that these alleged difficulties are quite as intractable.\naslama 397", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Given\nwhat was said earlier, the implicit reflexive is unlikely to be wajhahu, which only appears\nat a fairly advanced moment in the Qur’an’s genesis, in the late Meccan verse Q 31:22.\nQuite possibly, absolute aslama and aslama li- are to be treated as equivalent to aslama\nnafsahu and aslama nafsahu li- , even though the phrase aslama nafsahu is completely\nabsent from the Qur’anic corpus (see, e.g., al- Thaʿlabī 2015, 4:136, reporting that ʿAṭāʾ\nparaphrased God’s command aslim in Q 2:131 as aslim nafsaka ilā llāhi wa- fawwiḍ amraka\nilayhi, “surrender yourself to God and entrust your afairs to him”).10 Or perhaps aslama is\nan ellipsis for aslama amrahu (Larcher 2020, 117, 126, 138). Yet another possibility—t hat the\nimplied accusative object of aslama could be qalbahu— will be raised below. In any case,\nwhat is more significant than speculating about the precise reflexive that is presupposed\nby intransitive aslama is to note just how solidly entrenched this implicitly reflexive usage\nof aslama is from the verb’s putatively earliest Qur’anic occurrences in Q 51:36, 68:35, and\n72:14, which straddle the boundary between the early Meccan and l ater Meccan surahs. All\nthree of these early occurrences have the active participle plural al- muslimūn, “ those who\nsurrender themselves,” while the third verse additionally employs man aslama, “he who\nsurrenders himself.” As a consequence of this deeply rooted ellipsis, which was inherited\nrather than created by the Qur’an (note again the Safaitic inscription adduced e arlier), the\noriginally transitive verb aslama efectively behaves like an intransitive verb in almost all\nof its Qur’anic occurrences.\nIn En glish translation, of course, the implied reflexive must be supplied. The alter-\nnative solution of employing the intransitive verb “to surrender” is not feasible, since\nintransitive “to surrender” would convey a sense of capitulation and admitting defeat,\nespecially in a military context, that would arguably misrepresent the Qur’anic semantics\nof aslama when used to describe the ideal human stance vis- à- vis God. By contrast, “to\nsurrender oneself” more accurately captures the notion of self- abandonment to God, of\nhanding oneself over and entrusting oneself to him, which seems to be at the heart of\nthe Qur’anic use of aslama.\nIntransitive aslama vs istaslama. It is remarkable that the Qur’an nowhere collapses\nthis quasi- intransitive elliptical use of aslama into the tenth-f orm verb istaslama, literally\n9 On the elliptical usage of verbs that normally take direct or prepositional objects, see also Seidensticker\n2011a, 158–159. An example for a verb that is implicitly reflexive drawn from con temporary En glish would be “to\nshave”— namely, oneself (Larcher 2020, 135). For a somewhat dif er ent perspective, see Leemhuis 1977, 41, who\nmaintains that a verb like aslama “with a zero object that has an internal causative meaning need not necessarily\nbe explained as originally resulting from an elliptical construction”; rather, “the construction with an explicit\nobject that denotes the self can very well be considered as used for emphasis only, the construction with the\nzero object being prior.” What supports Leemhuis’s assessment is the existence of other fourth-f orm verbs that\nmay be understood as “internal causatives” (Leemhuis 1977, 38–65), including abāna, “to show o.s. to be clear”\n(see under → bayyana).\n10 Especially in ter est ing in this regard is Q 27:44: innī ẓalamtu nafsī wa-a slamtu maʿa sulaymāna li-l lāhi\nrabbi l- ʿālamīn, “I have wronged myself, and together with Solomon I surrender myself to the Lord of the\nworld- dwellers.” Given that aslamtu here occurs immediately a fter innī ẓalamtu nafsī, one might have expected\naslamtuhā.\n398 aslama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The context of this statement makes it very\nclear that the kind of self-s urrender at stake in Q 37:26 is starkly dif er ent from the stance\nof unconditional trust in God prior to the eschatological judgement that the Qur’anic\nproclamations seek to inculcate in their recipients. The sinners in Q 37:26 are surrender-\ning to God only after having been miraculously resurrected and in the face of imminent\nperdition; as a later Meccan verse puts it, they merely and unmeritoriously believe upon\n“seeing our might” (Q 40:85). From the Qur’anic perspective, such a belated act of capit-\nulation is emphatically not the same stance as coming to believe in God’s unbridled ability\nto hold h umans to account before God’s punishment actually begins to unfold, a stance that\nthe Qur’an would have humans adopt based on the sundry “signs” (singular: → āyah) of\nGod’s omnipotence and munificence that are distributed all over the cosmos (Sinai 2019a,\n248–249). In view of this distinction, a translator might consider bringing out the difer-\nence between istaslama at Q 37:26 and the ordinary Qur’anic use of aslama by rendering\nthe former not as “to surrender oneself,” which is best reserved for absolute aslama, but\nrather as “to capitulate” or “to be forced to surrender.”\nSo why does the Qur’an express the virtue of trusting self-s urrender to God in the\npre sent life by an elliptical use of the originally transitive verb aslama rather than by the\nexplic itly reflexive tenth- form verb istaslama? Apart from the fact that there is a valid\nconceptual distinction to be made between the two types of self-s urrender to God that\nhave just been outlined, the well- established use of the cognate verb ashlem to denote a\nreligious virtue in Jewish Aramaic and Syriac, to be reviewed in the following section,\nsurely supplies an impor tant part of the answer.12\nCognate terminology in pre- Qur’anic traditions. Assuming a unitary understand-\ning of aslama as “to surrender,” can we further flesh out the connotations of the kind of\nself- surrender and self-a bandonment that is at stake? Bravmann argues that the notion\nshould be seen as tantamount to the heroic defiance of death that is also articulated by the\nformulation → sharā nafsahu (“to sell one’s soul”; see Q 2:102.207) or its extra- Qur’anic\nrelatives ahāna nafsahu (“to scorn one’s soul”) and badhala nafsahu (“to squander one’s\nsoul”; Bravmann 1972, 19–23; see also Bravmann 1977, 434–454). Bravmann accordingly\nmaintains that Qur’anic aslama expresses the same demand for religious militancy that is\nQur’anically referred to as “contending (→ jāhada) on God’s path (→ sabīl).” However,\na fatal prob lem with this suggestion (apart from Bravmann’s reliance on post- Qur’anic\n11 Nevin Reda poses the question why the Qur’an should employ absolute aslama, rather than the tenth-f orm\nverb istaslama with its established reflexive connotation, in order to express the idea of self- surrender to God; her\nsolution is to propose that Qur’anic aslama should be translated not as “submission” but rather as “wholeness-\nmaking, peace- making, safety- making and well- being- making,” based on the meaning of other derivatives of\nthe root s- l- m (Reda 2012, 243–245). However, this founde rs on the early Arabic evidence presented above to\nthe efect that aslama means “to surrender, abandon, forsake, deliver up.” A supplementary objection to Reda’s\nhypothesis is the fact that Q 4:35.128 and 49:9–10, which explic itly address issues of reconciliation in a marital\nand a military context, use aṣlaḥa rather than aslama.\n12 According to Pierre Larcher, the “implicitly reflexive” fourth- form verb aslama corresponds to the “explic-\nitly reflexive” tenth-f orm verb istaslama (Larcher 2020, 116–117, 126, 138). I have no quarrel with the contention\nthat the two words are linguistically equivalent; yet I consider it nonetheless significant that the Qur’an reserves\nistaslama for a sort of self- surrender that is palpably dif er ent from the meritorious faith- based self- surrender to\nGod that qualifies one for eschatological reward.\naslama 399", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Moreover, unlike the poetic prooftexts adduced above, which deploy the verb\naslama in vario us secular contexts, Qur’anic instances of the word have a very clear reli-\ngious sense, in so far as they concern the attitude h umans are bidden to adopt t owards God\n(Lyall 1903, 782; Ringgren 1949, 22).15 In attempting to gauge the wider cultural background\nto the Qur’anic understanding of handing oneself over to God, it is therefore pertinent\nto extend our attention to Hebrew and Aramaic, which like the Qur’an use cognates of\nArabic aslama in explic itly religious contexts (for an erudite survey, refer to Kister 2018,\nbut see already KU 55).\nAs highlighted by Leopold Zunz and again by Shulamit Elizur, the idea of surrendering\none’s self or soul is not infrequent in late antique piyyuṭ, or Jewish liturgical poetry (Zunz\n1865, 641–642; Elizur in Elʿazar berabbi Qillir 2014, 106–108). For instance, several Hebrew\npoems by the seventh- century author Elʿazar berabbi Qallir (or Qillir; see Münz-M anor\n2019) apply the notion of surrendering one’s self or soul to Isaac’s willingness to be sacrificed\nby his f ather Abraham (e.g., Elʿazar berabbi Qillir 2014, 307: ha- mashlim bә-ʿ ēqed nepesh;\ncf. Kister 2018, 399). Similar diction is found in Aramaic poetry (Sokolof and Yahalom\n1999, 264 = no. 45:15: napsheh ashlem), and indeed Hebrew hishlim nepesh would seem to\nbe a calque of its Aramaic equivalent (Rand 2006, 500–501). Both in Hebrew and Aramaic,\nthe phrase is not only used in the context of self-s acrifice for the sake of God but can also\nrefer to the natur al death of pious individuals like Sarah or Moses (Elizur in Elʿazar berabbi\nQillir 2014, 106). Thus, a fter living for 930 years, Adam “surrendered his soul (or himself)\nto” God (Sokolof and Yahalom 1999, 286 = no. 52:4; cf. Rand 2006, 500). As regards the\nrelated phrase “to surrender one’s heart” (hishlim lēb), it connotes neither sacrifice of one’s\nlife nor a natur al death but rather, as Elizur notes, “ wholehearted veneration of God” (Elizur\nin Elʿazar berabbi Qillir 2014, 107, n. 30). This would seem to be the sense in which the\npoet Yannai affirms that Jacob “surrendered himself (ʿaṣmo hishlim) to you,” namely, to\nGod (Rabinovitz 1985–1987, 1:213, cited in Kister 2018, 386) or in which Midrash Tanḥuma\ndescribes proselytes as “surrendering themselves to” (mashlim ʿaṣmo lә-) God (Lek lәkā 6,\ncited in Kister 2018, 387; Berman translates diferently).16 It is worth adding that Jewish\nAramaic can also employ the verb ashlem in a mundane sense, e.g., to refer to the handing\nover of money (DJBA 1151).\n13 For a critical assessment of some of the poetic prooftexts cited in an e arlier Hebrew version of Bravmann’s\nargument, see Ringgren 1949, 4–5 and 18–22.\n14 The occurrence of aslama in Q 37:103 could be the result of secondary revision (HCI 94).\n15 Lyall allows that a religious significance may not apply to Q 27:31.38, which are part of the story of Solomon\nand the queen of Sabaʾ (Lyall 1903, 782, n. 1). See also Kister 2018, 400–404, who conjectures that Q 27:31 reflects\nthe meaning that aslama had in an antecedent tradition on which the Qur’anic passage at hand is dependent.\nSee also Ringgren 1949, 28–29. Another Qur’anic occurrence of aslama that could be read as referring only or\nprimarily to secular surrender is Q 48:16.\n16 As so often for rabbinic lit er a ture, a pre- Qur’anic dating of Midrash Tanḥuma is uncertain. Stemberger\n1996, 305–306, tentatively accepts Böhl’s dating of the substance of the work to around 400 CE, though he explic-\nitly notes the possibility of “further development.” For a more detailed analy sis positing early traditions going\nback to amoraic times, a bulk of material created and edited in the sixth and seventh centuries, and subsequent\ngeonic additions, see Bregman 2003.

Particularly reminiscent of some of the Jewish proof-\ntexts reviewed above are Aphrahat’s statement that Jesus “surrendered himself to death\non the cross” (ashlem napsheh l- mawtā da-ṣ lībā; Demonstrations 6:9 = Parisot 1894, 277,\nll. 17–18) and a passage in the Syriac version of Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History describing\nhow an anonymous martyr “surrendered his soul (ashlem napsheh) clothed in victory”\nwhile sufering gruelling torture (Wright and McLean 1898, 329, l. 6 = book 8:6:4), corre-\nsponding to paredōke tēn psychēn in the Greek version (Eusebius 1926–1932, 2:266–267; see\nalso TS 4187). At the same time, we also find self- surrender in the sense of wholehearted\ndevotion rather than ac cep tance of death for the sake of God: the Syriac version of Sirach\n49:3 characterises Josiah as someone who ashlem l- allāhā lebbeh (Kister 2018, 387), cor-\nresponding to kateuthynen pros kyrion tēn kardian autou, “he directed his heart to God”\nin the Septuagint. Incidentally, just as in Jewish Aramaic, the notion of self-s urrender is not\nconfined to religious contexts in Syriac. For example, Aphrahat describes a labourer who\nhires himself out to an employer as having “surrendered himself to” (ashlem napsheh l- )\nhim (Demonstrations 20:3 = Parisot 1894, 897, l. 21).17\nAs Kister notes, the Hebrew original of Sirach 49:3, just cited in Syriac and Greek,\nemploys the root t- m- m, indicating completeness (Kister 2018, 387): “he devoted his heart\nentirely to God” (HALOT 1754). The idea of wholehearted devotion is also attested in\nthe Qur’an, in two early Meccan verses (Q 26:89, 37:84) that speak of t hose who w ill be\nsaved at the eschatological judgement and of Abraham as coming to God bi- qalbin salīm,\nconventionally rendered “with a sound heart.” As vario us scholars have pointed out (CQ\n50; Künstlinger 1935, 129; Ringgren 1949, 8–10; AHW 180–181; Kister 2018, 399–400), the\nphrase forms a con spic u ous cognate of the Hebrew phrase bә-l ēb/lēbāb šālēm, “with a\nwhole heart” or “whole- heartedly” (Isa 38:3; 1 Chr 12:39, 28:9, and 29:9; 2 Chr 19:9, 25:2;\nsee HALOT 1538 and TDOT 7:410). Also pertinent are Biblical verdicts to the efect that\nthe hearts of miscellaneous kings of Judah were or were not “ whole (šālēm) with”— i.e.,\nwholly devoted to—t he Lord (1 Kgs 8:61, 11:4, 15:3.14; 2 Kgs 20:3; 2 Chr 15:17; see also 1 Chr\n29:19).18 Seeing that Q 26:89 and 37:84 may well precede the earliest Qur’anic instances\nof the participle muslim (Q 51:36, 68:35, 72:14), one may won der whether the implicit\nobject of absolute aslama or muslim might not be qalbahu, such that a muslim is someone\nwho surrenders specifically his heart (corresponding to Syriac ashlem l- allāhā lebbeh).19\nThis conjecture would work best if bi- qalbin salīm were taken to mean not “with a sound\nheart,” but rather to convey approximately the same content as Hebrew bә- lēb/lēbāb šālēm,\nnamely, “with a heart wholly devoted” to God. This is not inconceivable, and in fact not\ntoo far away from an exegetical gloss explaining that bi- qalbin salīm at Q 26:89 means with\n17 Another seeming Syriac parallel is provided by Jefery, who cites the phrase ashlem napsheh l-a llāhā wa-\nl- ʿīdteh, “to submit o.s. to God and his church” (FVQ 63). Though he fails to provide a reference, it would seem\nthat his source is TS 4187 (see Ringgren 1949, 32). But the reference given there is to Bar Hebraeus, who is clearly\nfar too late to be probative in an argument about the Qur’an.\n18 As Kister notes, another relevant parallel is Targum Neofiti on Gen 22:8, which employs the Aramaic\nequivalent of bә- lēb šālēm in order to amplify the Biblical statement that Abraham and Isaac “walked on together.”\nQ 37:84, too, applies the phrase to Abraham, but not in connection with the binding of his son. However, a later\nverse in the same surah, v. 103, states that Abraham and his son aslamā, “surrendered themselves,” similar to\nJewish praise of Isaac’s self-surrender as quoted above.\n19 In support of an implicit link between aslama and the heart (qalb), see Q 39:22, opposing those “whose\nbreast has been opened up to self- surrender” with the “hard of heart.”\naslama 401", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In the\nQur’an, the only explicit accusative object that appears together with aslama is wajhahu,\nnot nafsahu or qalbahu, as the Aramaic and Hebrew parallels might have led one to expect\n(Kister 2018, 406); and t here is only very l imited prec ed ent for the characteristic Qur’anic\nprevalence of aslama without an explicit accusative object.20 Nonetheless, it is credible that\nthe Qur’anic employment of aslama as a term denoting a core religious virtue would have\nbeen at least vaguely informed by the rabbinic and Christian precursors surveyed above—a\nconjecture voiced, on the basis of far fewer available sources, already by Horovitz (KU 55).21\nThis is not, of course, to propose that the semantics of Qur’anic aslama simply replicate\nthose of Aramaic ashlem or Hebrew hishlim. The link with the Hebrew and Aramaic cog-\nnates is perhaps most obvious in Q 37:103, where aslama occurs in connection with the\nnear- sacrifice of Abraham’s son (fa- lammā aslamā, “when the two of them surrendered\nthemselves [to God]”). Given the foregoing pre ce dents for describing Isaac as mashlim\nnepesh in Jewish texts, Q 37:103 could be taken to buttress the claim that Qur’anic aslama\ncan at least on occasion denote a readiness to embrace death for the sake of God. How-\never, unlike Isaac, Abraham is clearly not embracing his own death here. Consequently,\naslama in Q 37:103 more likely signifies a general attitude of acquiescence in the divine\nwill. In light of this observation, and despite my general policy of rendering aslama as “to\nsurrender,” I see merit in the argument, put to me by Mohsen Goudarzi, that the positive,\nactive, and voluntary quality of Qur’anic aslama is well captured by the translations “to\ndevote oneself to God” or “to dedicate oneself to God” (cf. also Abdel Haleem 2010, 15, n.\nb, in favour of “to devote oneself”).\nThis general understanding of self- surrender or devotion to God is borne out by most\nother Qur’anic instances of aslama or its active participle muslim. Thus, when Abraham\nurges his sons and his grand son Jacob to die belonging to those who “surrender them-\nselves,” namely, to God (Q 2:132: fa- lā tamūtunna illā wa- antum muslimūn), he is plainly\nimpressing on them the need for lifelong pious devotion to God. The same conclusion is\nsupported by Q 68:15, opposing muslim to mujrim, “sinner, evildoer,” and by the antithet-\nical parallelism in Q 72:14 (wa- annā minnā l- muslimūna wa- minnā l- qāsiṭūna, “that there\nare among us t hose who surrender and t hose who act unjustly”; see Hirschfeld 1902, 13–14,\nand KU 54).22 A handful of verses contrasts self- surrender to God with repudiation of God\nor his signs (verb: → kafara; see Q 3:19.52.80, 9:74, 15:2).

See also the line by Yannai quoted in Kister 2018,\n386 (Rabinovitz 1985–1987, 1:213). Another case of hishlim without reflexive accusative object occurs in Midrash\nTәhillim (Kister 2018, 386, n. 23), but the date of this work is too uncertain to set much store by the parallel.\n21 For an opposing voice, see Ringgren 1949, 32–33, who maintains that Qur’anic use is explicable as the\nin de pen dent development and religious adaptation of “a common Arabic word.”\n22 On qasaṭa in the sense of acting unjustly, see NB 98, referencing a line from a poem attributed to Aws\nibn Ḥajar in which al- qusūṭ is opposed to al- dīn (Geyer 1892, no. 32:7). Puzzlingly, the meaning of the fourth-\nform verb aqsaṭa is the opposite of the alleged meaning of qasaṭa, namely, “to be fair, to act justly” (cf. also qisṭ,\n“fairness, equity”; see briefly under → ẓalama and → maʿrūf). However, the context of Q 72:14 makes it certain\nthat qasaṭa has a negative meaning here, since the qāsiṭūn are said to be condemned to hell (Q 72:15). We thus\nfind the root q- s-ṭ used both for justice and for injustice. A comparable case, incidentally, is presented by the\nroot ʿ- d- l.

This is further confirmed by the early Meccan\npassage Q 51:35–36, where āmana and aslama are employed as synonyms. Also instruc-\ntive is the Medinan passage Q 22:34–35, which associates self-s urrender with humility,\nfear of God, and steadfastness (Ringgren 1949, 27–28), which are all what one might call\nlong-t erm virtues. In another cluster of passages, the opposite of self-s urrender to God\nconsists in illicitly associating (→ ashraka) other beings with God (Q 3:64.67, 6:14.163).\nTo surrender oneself to God, it seems, is to surrender oneself to him exclusively. There is a\nfurther instance in which the root s- l- m would seem to express a connotation of exclusivity:\nQ 39:29 (Baneth 1971, 185–186), juxtaposing “a man belonging to partners who disagree”\n(rajulan fīhi shurakāʾu mutashākisūna) and “a man who is the exclusive property of one\nman [only]” (rajulan salaman li- rajulin).23 It is worth noting that premodern exeget-\nical voices likewise consider the Qur’anic concept of self- abandonment to God to hinge\non surrendering oneself to God exclusively (see, e.g., Fakhr al-D īn al-R āzī 1981, 11:57, on\nQ 4:125–126, according to which “facing God in self-s urrender” means that one “surrenders\noneself to God and not anyone else”).\nIn sum, the Qur’anic notion of self-s urrender to God, which is closely integrated into\nits overarching system of ethical concepts (GMK 198–215), is best interpreted as denot-\ning a general stance of wholehearted, unconditional, and exclusive self- abandonment to\nGod—in the words of phi los o pher John Hick, as “the Muslim form of the transformation\nof human existence from self- centredness to Reality- centredness” (Hick 1989, 48). This is\nnot a mere case of human self- abasement before God but includes “total confidence” in\nhim (Ringgren 1949, 13 and 33; see also Andrae 1932, 55). On occasion, one of the facets\nthat are discernible in the Qur’anic notion of self- abandonment to the deity may indeed be\nself-s acrifice, w hether in the sense of submission to persecution or, as Bravmann maintains,\nin the sense of heroic death- defiance in battle. Thus, the late verse Q 22:78 (on which see\nRinggren 1949, 28) could perhaps be read as associating self-s urrender to God with militant\nstriving, in view of the fact that the verse also employs → jāhada, “to contend,” which in the\nMedinan Qur’an tends to have a militant signification. On the other hand, Q 22:78 does not\nactually make any unequivocal reference to fighting, and the preceding verse enumerates\nseveral non- martial virtues like bowing and prostration in prayer, serving God, and d oing\ngood (Q 22:77). It is therefore not justified to follow Bravmann in viewing self- sacrifice,\nand in par tic u lar militancy, as the core of the Qur’anic notion of self- surrender.\nThe noun islām and the question of salvation outside the Qur’anic ummah. Apart\nfrom vari ous finite forms of the fourth- form verb aslama and the active participle mus-\nlim, the Qur’an also employs the corresponding verbal noun islām. Post- Qur’anic Arabic\noften uses aslama and muslim in a quasi- denominative sense, as if they w ere derived from\nthe noun islām, understood as the proper name of a specific religion distinct from others\n(i.e., aslama = “to profess or adopt Islam”; muslim = “one who professes or has adopted\nIslam”). But it cannot be taken for granted that Qur’anic instances of islām and muslim\nbut there are also instances in the Qur’an where ʿadala or ʿadala bi- are obviously employed in a negative sense\n(e.g., Q 6:1, 27:60; see CDKA 184 and Hourani 1985, 32–33).\n23 My rendering adopts the wording proposed in CDKA 138, which I take to be inferable from the context.\nOn Q 39:29, see also Larcher 2020, 127.\naslama 403", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Especially noteworthy is perhaps Q 22:78, according to which\nAbraham “called youp”—t hat is, the addressees—“ ‘t hose who surrender themselves’ before\nand in this” (sammākumu l-m uslimīna min qablu wa- fī hādhā).25 The statement alludes\nto Abraham and Ishmael’s prayer, as reported in Q 2:128, that God bring forth from their\ndescendants “a community that surrenders itself to you” (ummatan muslimatan laka). The\nMedinan verses just surveyed make it pos sib le to construe the term al- islām as designating\nthe Qur’anic religion in par tic u lar, in contrast to Judaism, Christ ian ity, or pagan cults—in\nother words, to construe al- islām as “reified Islam” in the sense of “the making of Islam as\na separate confessional identity” (Sirry 2014, 69).26\nNonetheless, in Qur’anic usage it is the verb aslama rather than the noun islām that is\nsemantically primary (thus already Smith 1991, 111–113). Thus, the basic meaning of the ver-\nbal noun islām is the act designated by the verb aslama, namely, a stance of unconditional\nhuman self-s urrender to God and total acquiescence in his w ill. This is clearest in the two\nchronologically earliest occurrences of the verbal noun islām in the Meccan verses Q 6:125\nand 39:22. Both speak of God “opening up someone’s breast up to self-s urrender” (sharaḥa\nllāhu ṣadrahu li- l- islāmi), thereby asserting that the h uman act of self-a bandonment to God\nrequires divine aid and assistance. In both verses, it is contextually appropriate to interpret\nislām as the human act of delivering oneself up to God, as an inner state of wholehearted\nbelief and devotion: the meta phor of a divine expanding and, in Q 6:125, constricting of the\nhuman breast (yajʿal ṣadrahu ḍayyiqan ḥarajan) implies as much, and Q 39:22 opposes t hose\nwhose breast has been opened up to self-s urrender with “t hose whose hearts are hardened\nagainst God’s reminding exhortation” (al- qāsiyah qulūbuhum min dhikri llāhi).\nThis use of the noun islām to refer to a general religious stance is not surprising in the\nMeccan surahs, since the latter do not yet exhibit any sustained boundary- making between\nthe Qur’anic religion, on the one hand, and Judaism and Christ ian ity, on the other (HCI\n178–179 and 196–206). But even for Medinan passages like Q 3:85 (“Whoever desires a\nreligion other than al- islām, it will not be accepted from him, and he w ill be one of the\nlosers in the hereafter”), it is on balance preferable to opt for a non- reified understanding\nof al- islām and to consider the noun to pick out merely an ideal attitude of unconditional\nself- surrender to God.27 This is so because two other Medinan verses, Q 2:62 and 5:69,\nclearly allow for the eschatological salvation of adherents of other religions, like Judaism\n24 This is seen very clearly in Q 2:62, 5:69, and 22:17, in all of which “the believers” figure in an enumeration\nof religious communities that also includes the Jews and the Christians.\n25 Donner 2019, 138–139, raises the possibility that Q 22:78 or part of it might date to the time of ʿAbd al-\nMalik, but early manuscript evidence makes this unlikely; see n. 7 u nder → ab.\n26 Sirry’s use of the idea of reification of course harks back to Smith 1991 (as acknowledged in Sirry 2014,\n204).\n27 As Mun’im Sirry has shown, such a non- reified understanding of al- islām is, to dif ere nt degrees, endorsed\nby many reformist interpreters, such as Muḥammad Rashīd Riḍā and Mawlana Abul Kalam Azad (Sirry 2014,\n65–99).\n404 aslama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

That t here are in fact Christians and Jews who meet the Qur’an’s\ncriteria for proper self- surrender to God is affirmed in Q 3:199, stating that some of the\n“scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb)— i.e., some Jews or Christians—do “believe in God\nand in what was sent down to youp and what was sent down to them.”28 Hence, if one\nwere to take a statement like Q 3:85 to mean that no one outside the Qur’anic community\n(→ ummah) can hope for salvation, one would end up generating a significant doctrinal\ntension not only within the Qur’an, but within the Medinan surahs in par tic u lar.29 More-\nover, the assumption that even in the Medinan period a non- reified understanding of\naslama and islām remains primary is confirmed by Medinan verses that describe Abraham\nand his immediate descendants as having “surrendered themselves” to God (Q 2:131–133,\n3:67) or make a passing reference to Jewish “prophets who surrendered themselves”\n(Q 5:44: al- nabiyyūna lladhīna aslamū). Throughout the Qur’an, then, being muslim and\nthe act of islām are primarily attributes describing a certain religious stance rather than a\npar tic u lar communal affiliation in contrast to others. In princi ple, then, one must under-\nstand the Qur’an to allow for the existence of muslim Israelites, muslim Jews, and muslim\nChristians (even if a muslim associator would of course be an oxymoron).\nStill, there can be little doubt that the Medinan proclamations are imbued by a strong\nconviction that the required attitude of self-s urrender to God is, in Muhammad’s historical\nenvironment, paradigmatically and most fully realised by the Qur’anic ummah, whose\nbeliefs are identical with the “teaching” (→ millah) of the exemplary mono thei st Abraham\n(Q 22:78).30 The Qur’anic ummah is accordingly commended as “the best community ever\nbrought forth for p eople” (Q 3:110: kuntum khayra ummatin ukhrijat li-l - nāsi). Moreover,\nthose who would genuinely surrender themselves to God are undoubtedly expected to\naccept the Qur’an’s stringent interpretation of mono thei sm, which would appear to exclude\nmainstream Christian Trinitarianism, and to recognise Muhammad’s prophetic authority\n(Sinai 2015–2016, 50–51 and 78–80). That is to say, it seems doubtful whether a Christian\nwho, against the Qur’an’s explicit strictures (see under → al-n aṣārā), persists in main-\ntaining that Christ is the son of God and a member of the Trinity may be considered to\nmeet the standards for salvation invoked in Q 2:62 and 5:69. As regards acknowledgement\nof Muhammad, the latter is explic itly given the task of “providing clarity” to the “scripture-\nowners” (Q 5:15.19: yā- ahla l- kitābi qad jāʾakum rasūlunā yubayyinu lakum . . .), and Q 3:20\ncharges him with preaching not just to the “scriptureless” (al-u mmiyyūn; → ummī) but\nalso to “ those who were given the scripture,” i.e., Jews and Christians (qul li-l ladhīna ūtū\nl-k itāba wa-l -u mmiyyīna a-a slamtum). Another Medinan passage, Q 7:158, calls upon\n“the people” (al-n ās) “in general” (jamīʿan) to “believe in God and his Messenger, the\nprophet of the scriptureless,” and to “follow him so that you may be guided” (wa- ttabiʿūhu\nlaʿallakum tahtadūn).31 It does not appear, then, that ac cep tance of Muhammad as a\n28 For another cursory reference to believing members of the “scripture- owners,” see Q 3:110.\n29 That Medinan passages, or even passages within one and the same Medinan surah, might contradict one\nanother is of course far from impossible.

The pagan associ-\nators, to be sure, are unquestionably expected to relinquish their erstwhile religious and\nritual identity and fully to merge into the Qur’anic community of believers. But conceptual\nspace is made for the existence of muslim Christians and muslim Jews who do not by virtue\nof their self-s urrender to God automatically become members of the Qur’anic ummah.32\nThis is clearest in Q 3:113 and 5:66 (Sinai 2015–2016, 79–80; similarly Goudarzi 2019, 435).\nBoth verses posit that among the “scripture- owners” t here is a “community” (→ ummah),\nor rather subcommunity, that “stands upright” (qāʾimah) or who is at least “middling”\n(muqtaṣidah, on which see under → ˻ahl al- kitāb). Q 3:113–114 in par tic u lar describe the\nmembers of this scripturalist subcommunity in markedly positive terms, inter alia crediting\nthem with belief in God and the final day (cf. also Q 7:159). Similarly, Q 4:162 allows for\nJews who are “firmly grounded in knowledge and believers” (al- rāsikhūna fī l-ʿ ilmi minhum\nwa- l- muʾminūna; cf. Q 3:7, discussed u nder → bayyana). Also relevant is the Medinan verse\nQ 5:48, which pre sents a plurality of religious communities as a divinely willed feature of\nthe world: “Had God willed, he would have made you a single community” (wa- law shāʾa\nllāhu la- jaʿalakum ummatan wāḥidatan).33 As becomes clear from the surrounding verses\n(Q 5:41–50.66.68), the three religious communities in question—t he Jews, the Christians,\nand the Qur’anic believers— are envisaged as being in possession of, and “judging by,”\ndif er ent scriptures, namely, the Torah (→ al-t awrāh), the Gospel (→ al-i njīl), and the\nQur’an. Perhaps for this reason, Q 5:48 implicitly portrays t hese communities as being\nlegitimately distinguished by dif ere nt normative practices (singular: shirʿah) and customs\n(singular: minhāj).34\n32 See similarly Goudarzi 2019, 435: “Even Jews and Christians who acknowledged Muḥammad as a God-s ent\nmessenger did not automatically enter the ranks of the Prophet’s followers but remained outsiders.”\n33 A survey of how Q 5:48 is interpreted by some premodern and modern Muslim authors is provided in\nSirry 2009.\n34 Shirʿah is reasonably understood as something that has been authoritatively established or instituted, against\nthe background of the phrase sharaʿa li-X min al- dīn, approximately “to establish or institute religious precepts\nfor X” (Q 42:13.21), perhaps to be derived from the use of sharaʿa + acc. to mean “to guide to the watering-p lace”\n(namely, c attle) or “to make manifest” (namely, a road; AEL 1534). Note that the grammatical subject of sharaʿa is\neither God or the deities venerated by the Meccan pagans. Shirʿah is often interpreted as “religious law” (see, e.g.,\nthe exegetes quoted in Sirry 2009, 425–426), but it seems preferable to avoid an overly specific translation that is\ninformed by equating shirʿah with the cognate term sharīʿah, understood in its post- Qur’anic sense of the divine\nlaw that l egal scholars are seeking to approximate. In the context of Q 5:48, it is quite pos sib le that shirʿah and min-\nhāj form a pleonasm. On the Hebrew or Aramaic etymology of minhāj, see BEḲ 89, JPND 225, and FVQ 273. The\nword was prob ably drawn from the language of the Medinan Jews (see u nder → al- yahūd) and may accordingly\nhave connoted not simply custom in general but rather customs of the sort that set one religious community (e.g.,\nJews) apart from another (e.g., Christians or other non- Jews). For two int ere st ing parallels to Q 5:48, see 22:34.67\n(li-k ulli ummatin jaʿalnā mansakan, “for every community we have appointed a mansak”), which are discussed in\nmore detail u nder → ummah. Mansak seems to mean something like “religious rite,” prob ably of a sacrificial nature\n(see under → dhabaḥa). One might speculate that Q 5:48 uses the terms shirʿah and minhāj rather than mansak\nbecause the surrounding discussion concerns Judaism and Christ iani ty in par tic ul ar, both of which (at least in their\nnormative guises) had come to reject animal sacrifices by the seventh c entury CE.\n406 aslama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In so far as\nthe verb aslama means something inferior to fully fledged belief h ere, it likely signifies a\nperformative speech act expressing capitulation to or integration into the Qur’anic commu-\nnity. Given that obedience to the Qur’anic Messenger is, according to Q 4:80, equivalent\nto obedience to God, it is not surprising that submission to the Medinan ummah could\nbe framed as surrender to God.

Q 68:43 with the active participle sālim). The verb is also attested in Safaitic\n(Al- Jallad 2015a, 270 with LP 643, 342). The basic meaning of the noun salām is therefore\n“security” or “safety.”1 Larcher identifies a core connotation of “preservation” and notes a\ncertain proximity to the semantics of Latin salus (Larcher 2020, 125, 139), while Ambros\nofers the paraphrase “state of being unimpaired and unendangered, well- being, safety”\n(CDKA 138). Salām, then, designates the general condition of being unharmed, intact, and\nunthreatened. It follows that the almost instinctual tendency to translate Qur’anic salām\nas “peace,” which suggests a much narrower meaning— namely, an absence of violent\nconflict between h uman parties— deserves to be bracketed, even if it is of course evident\nhow the word could take on this more specific sense. Interestingly, at least if one goes by\nthe Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim reading of the Qur’anic rasm, two passages (Q 8:61 and 47:35) that do\nclearly speak of “peace” in the sense of the opposite of war do not employ salām but rather\nanother verbal noun, salm (Larcher 2020, 121–122 and 140–141, noting the use of ḥarb at\nQ 8:57; cf. CDKA 138).2 One must of course remember that both salām and salm share the\n1 For a Safaitic attestation of the noun s1lm, see krc .o rient .o x .a c .u k /o ciana /c orpus /p ages /O CIANA\n_ 0002895 . html (HCH 42, accessed 5 May 2022), where two deities are petitioned for “safety and a reunion\nwith loved ones.”\n2 The reading of Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim has salm at Q 8:61 and 47:35 and silm at 2:208 (which latter verse urges\nthe believers to “enter al-s ilm”). The meaning of silm at Q 2:208 is more difficult to pinpoint than that of salm\nat Q 8:61 and 47:35. Frequently, al- silm is equated with al- islām (Larcher 2020, 126 and 140). Ringgren accepts\nthis, but the poetic prooftexts that he cites from Ibn Hishām hardly warrant much confidence (Ringgren 1949,\n11–12). When Paret 2001 tentatively translates al- silm as “the state of salvation” (Zustand des Heils), he positions\nthe word in proximity to the eschatologically charged employment of salām that is surveyed further below in\nthe main text. Of course, both silm and salām share the same consonantal skeleton, which makes the latter in princi-\nple a viable reading of the text, though not one that appears to have left traces in the qirāʾāt lit er a ture.

This makes it conceivable that the impression of a tidy\ncontextual distribution between salm in the sense of intrahuman peace and salām in the\nmore general sense of safety and protection from harm is a result of systematising eforts\nby the Qur’an’s early transmitters.3\nComing now to salām, the word can be used to designate safety from harm in inner-\nworldly settings. For example, Abraham and the mysterious guests who will go on to\nannounce the future birth of his son exchange the greeting salām (Q 11:69, 15:52, 51:25),\nand when Abraham’s idolatrous foes attempt to burn him alive, God orders the fire to be\n“coolness and safety” (bardan wa- salāman) for him (Q 21:69). Other verses, too, portray\nhumans as exchanging greetings of salām (Q 6:54, 19:47, 25:63, 28:55, 43:89), which one\nshould perhaps translate along the lines of “May you remain safe/unharmed!” in lieu of\nthe conventional “Peace be upon you!” Q 97:5 describes the “night of foreordainment”\n(laylat al- qadr; → amr) as being “safety u ntil the rise of dawn” (salāmun hiya ḥattā maṭlaʿi\nl-f ajr), and Noah is told by God to alight from the ark “in safety vouchsafed by us and\nwith blessings upon youS” (bi- salāmin minnā wa- barakātin ʿalayka). In many other verses,\nhowever, the word salām is unmistakably linked specifically with eschatological salvation.\nThus, Q 6:127 and 10:25 describe paradise as “the abode of safety” (dār al-s alām; e.g.,\nQ 6:127: lahum dāru l- salāmi ʿinda rabbihim, “they partake of the abode of security in the\npresence of their Lord”). Moreover, it is with greetings involving the noun salām that\nthe inhabitants of paradise are frequently addressed on God’s behalf (Q 7:46, 10:10, 13:24,\n14:23, 15:46, 16:32, 19:62, 25:75, 33:44, 36:58, 39:73, 50:34, 56:26.91; see Horovitz 1975, 59,\nand also u nder → jannah). Accordingly, it is by entering paradise that one achieves ultimate\nintegrity and safety from harm. This pattern of usage lends support to Lidzbarski’s hypoth-\nesis that Arabic salām may in certain contexts function as an equivalent of Greek sōtēria,\n“salvation” (Lidzbarski 1922, 87–88; → aslama). Nonetheless, even in t hese contexts the\nword should preferably be rendered in such a way as not to obscure its basic meaning,\nperhaps as “salvific security.” At Q 59:24 (on which see under → ism), the divine epithet\nal- salām is best paraphrased as calling God a bestower of salvific security or safety.\nsalīm: bi- qalb ~ | with a sound heart\n→ aslama, → qalb\nsulaymān | Solomon\n→ jinn\ncontinuation of the verse cautions against “following the footsteps of the devil (→ al- shayṭān).” The situation\nis further complicated by the existence of textual variants for all three verses u nder discussion. For Q 8:61 and\n47:35, readings other than Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim have silm rather than salm (MQ 3:322 and 9:33; MQQ 2:460 and 6:197),\nwhile for 2:208 some readers (including Nāfiʿ, Ibn Kathīr, and al- Kisāʾī) reportedly read al- salm rather than al- silm\n(MQ 1:282–283; MQQ 1:158). In light of this, it cannot be ruled out that silm and salm are r eally just variants of\none and the same lexeme rather than expressing distinct meanings, what ever they might be.\n3 Note that I have only spot- checked the existence of reading variants for salām in some of the verses about\nto be quoted in the main text (and come away with a nil return). One piece of evidence suggesting at least the\npossibility of uncertainty between salām and other nouns sharing the same consonantal skeleton s-l -m is the\nfact that according to Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim, alqā + al- s- l- m (which must mean something like “to ofer a greeting”) is\nnormally vocalised as alqā al- salama (Q 4:90.91, 16:28.87), but at Q 4:94 is instead read as alqā al- salāma. Other\nreaders have alqā al- salama for Q 4:94 as well (MQ 2:132; MQQ 2:154; see also Larcher 2020, 141–142).\nsulaymān 409", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Throughout the Qur’an, listening and seeing represent receptivity\nto persuasive preaching (e.g., Q 7:198, 39:18, 50:37) and to the “signs” (→ āyāt) of God’s\npresence and power in nature and history.1 In many cases, however, humans “hear” God’s\n“reminding exhortation” (e.g., Q 68:51: lammā samiʿū l- dhikra) yet reject it nonetheless:\nto listen is not necessarily to heed. A lack of the ability to draw the proper religious con-\nsequences from one’s aural and visual perception is sometimes represented as divinely\nwrought incapacitation of the senses of hearing and sight: just as God has endowed h umans\nwith “hearing, sight, and hearts so that they might be grateful” (Q 16:78: wa-j aʿala la-\nkumu l- samʿa wa-l -a bṣāra wa-l -a fʾidata laʿallakum tashkurūn; see similarly 23:78, 32:9,\nand 67:23, as well as 10:31, 46:26, and 76:2), so God can take away the ability to access\nreligious truth through empirical engagement with the world and reflection thereon (see\nunder → khatama and also under → qalb).\nGod himself is repeatedly described not only as “knowing” (ʿalīm) but also as “hearing”\n(samīʿ; e.g., Q 2:127.137.181, 3:34.35, or 26:220, combining samīʿ and ʿalīm) and “seeing” (baṣīr;\ne.g., Q 4:58.134, 17:1, 58:1, combining samīʿ and baṣīr). This is in line with Qur’anic statements\nthat God has a face and eyes (see u nder → allāh). God, then, is not merely an intellect with\ncognitive access to all true propositions but has the sort of immediate awareness of goings-on\nin the world, such as prayers addressed to him, that characterises sense perception (Q 3:38,\n14:39: God is samīʿu l-d uʿāʾ or “hears prayer”). Qur’anic references to h uman and divine\nhearing and seeing would no doubt merit more detailed analy sis.2\nThe Israelites’ statement “We hear and disobey.” It is against the general background\nof human hearing as receptivity to religious truth in the Qur’an that one must place Q 2:93\nand 4:46, which impute to the Israelites or Jews the utterance samiʿnā wa-ʿ aṣaynā (“we\nhear and disobey”). The phrase bears a high degree of phonetic similarity to the Biblical\nexpression wә- šāmaʿnû wә- ʿāśînû (“and we will hear and do [it]”), which is credited to\nthe Israelites in Deut 5:27 as an expression of their willingness to carry out God’s com-\nmandments (BEḲ 63–64; Hirschfeld 1902, 109; KU 220; BEQ 301–303; Obermann 1941,\n31–34 and 40–47). The Jews’ alleged utterance would seem to be a punning inversion that\ntransforms a Hebrew declaration of obedience— which Obermann proposes may have\nfigured in cont emporary Jewish homilies— into an Arabic sentence that means precisely\nthe opposite. In the Qur’an, the Biblical affirmation is thus polemically turned on its head\n1 The ability to “hear” God’s guidance is not l imited to h umans but also encompasses the → jinn (Q 71:1.9.13).\n2 As Ahmad Al- Jallad points out to me, an inscription from the temple of Allāt in Qaryat al- Fāw asserts that\nthe goddess “listened” to the commissioner (Al- Said 2018, 406). The inscription, which the editor dates to the first\nor second c entury BCE, shows how ancient the notion of divine hearing is in Arabia. However, in the inscription\nthe operative meaning of divine hearing is clearly the answering of prayer rather than divine omniscience, or\nrather omnipercipience, as in the Qur’an.\n410 samiʿa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an subscribes to the Ancient Mesopotamian cosmological model\nof seven heavens (Q 2:29, 17:44, 23:17, 23:86, 41:12, 65:12, 67:3, 71:15, 78:12; see BEQ 11–13;\nNeuwirth 2001, 442–446; Janos 2012b; Tabataba’i and Mirsadri 2016, 209). Two verses\ndescribe the seven heavens as being superimposed “in layers” (ṭibāqan; Q 67:3, 71:15).\nThis could indicate that the heavens are stacked on top of one another like level planes\n(see Janos 2012b, 216–217, and Tabataba’i and Mirsadri 2016, 221), though as we shall see\nbelow the alternative position according to which they form a domed vault also merits\nconsideration. Like the earth, the heavens are God’s creation, though quite possibly not\nex nihilo but from a pre- existing substratum (see in more detail u nder → khalaqa). The\nphrase al- samāwāt wa- l- arḍ, “the heavens and the earth,” designating the Qur’anic cosmos\nin its entirety, is discussed elsewhere (→ arḍ).\nDetails on the heavenly edifice. In Qur’anic statements pertaining to the heavens,\narchitectural imagery is prevalent. Heaven or the sky is depicted as an edifice (bināʾ) and\nas resulting from divine “building” (verb: banā; see Q 2:22, 40:64, 50:6, 51:47, 78:12,\n79:27, 91:5; see also 13:2, 55:7, and 88:18, according to which the heaven or heavens were\n“raised up”). Twice the sky is called a “roof” (Q 21:32: saqf; 79:28: samk; see also 52:5).\nPossibly like a dome, the heavens are propped up “without a pillar (ʿamad) that youp can\nsee” (Q 13:2, 31:10), and God prevents the sky from collapsing upon the earth without his\npermission or idhn (Q 22:65: wa-y umsiku l-s amāʾa an taqaʿa ʿalā l-a rḍi illā bi-i dhnihi).\nAs we shall see in the following section, all of this is strongly reminiscent of Biblical and\nChristian cosmology.\nThe sky is equipped with what appear to be pathways or conduits, called asbāb (singu-\nlar: sabab), that lead up to the top of the cosmic dome and which Phar aoh vainly aspires\n3 Hirschfeld thinks that the Qur’anic verses at hand reflect an Arabising misunderstanding of the Hebrew\nwording, but it seems far more plausible to me that the transposal is a deliberate polemical move. This assessment\nresembles, but is not identical with, Obermann’s view that we are faced with a case of what he calls “wishful\nmishearing” on Muhammad’s part (Obermann 1941, 46).\nsamāʾ 411", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The literal meaning of sabab,\nof course, is “rope” or “cord,” and the under lying idea may be that the sky is a tent, with\nvertical and transverse ropes forming part of its “girding or structure” (van Bladel 2007,\n234–235). Though there is plainly some tension between picturing the sky as a solid edifice\nand as a tent, it is quite conceivable that the Qur’an attests to dif ere nt manners of imagining\nthe heavenly dome that were current in its cultural milieu. That the idea of heavenly asbāb\nhad a wider circulation in the Qur’anic environment is, in any case, demonstrated by two\nverses of early Arabic poetry that van Bladel cites from a poem by al- Aʿshā Maymūn and\nfrom the Muʿallaqah of Zuhayr, both of which make reference, in parallel phraseology, to\nascending “the asbāb of heaven (asbāb al- samāʾ) with a ladder (bi- sullam)” (Ḥusayn 1983,\nno. 15:32, and DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 16:54; see van Bladel 2007, 231–232).3\nThe sky, or the lowest heaven in par tic ul ar, is “adorned” (verb: zayyana) with stars, con-\nstellations (burūj), or “lights” (15:16, 37:6, 41:12, 50:6, 67:5).4 The sun and the moon, too,\nare affixed to or embedded in the seven heavens (Q 71:16; see also 78:13, likewise following\na reference to the seven heavens). Apart from their aesthetic value, the stars serve h umans\nas a means of orientation (Q 6:97, 16:16), while the sun and the moon dictate the diurnal\nrhythm of day and night and also endow h umans with a way of mea sur ing longer spans of time\n(e.g., Q 6:96, 10:5, 17:12; see also 55:5; cf. Gen 1:14–15 as well as BEQ 17–18). Such statements\nillustrate the anthropocentric nature of the Qur’anic cosmos (→ arḍ). The heavens also act as\n1 Van Bladel bases his claim that the Qur’anic asbāb are heavenly conduits or pathways on three bodies of\nevidence: an alleged parallel between Q 18:89 and a passage from the Syriac Alexander Legend, examination\nof the word’s use in the Qur’an, and two verses of early Arabic poetry. While I find van Bladel’s general claim\nplausible, I have reservations about the cogency of the Syriac parallel.\n2 On an alternative, traditional reading, the word sabab in Q 18:84.85.89.92 functions only as a general\nmeta phor for a “means” or “way” (see, e.g., KK 319 and Koloska 2015, 146). This position entails that the manner\nin which sabab functions in the story of Dhū l- Qarnayn has little to do with Q 38:10 and 40:36–37, which speak\nof “ascending on the asbāb” or “reaching the asbāb of the heavens” (cf. also Q 22:15). I would agree with van\nBladel, however, that it is attractive to understand the meaning of sabab in Q 18:84.85.89.92 in light of these\ninner- Qur’anic parallels. This is so despite the fact that the focus in Surah 18 is on Dhū l- Qarnayn’s miraculous\nmovement from one terrestrial location to another rather than on his access to the celestial realm as such, which\nis at stake in Q 38:10 and 40:36–37. From the Qur’anic perspective, the celestial realm remains generally out of\nreach to humans (see under → nazzala).\n3 Note that the verse from al- Aʿshā expresses the notion of ascending to heaven with the root r- q- y, as do\nQ 17:93 and 38:10.\n4 As Janos remarks, this would seem to contrast with the Ptolemaic cosmological model (see below), ac-\ncording to which the planets are located at dif er ent distances from the earth (Janos 2012b, 221). On the signs or\nconstellations of the zodiac, see Q 25:61 and 85:1 (in addition to 15:16, referenced in the main text). On the term\nburūj, literally “towers” (as in Q 4:78), see FVQ 78–79, identifying them with the constellations of the zodiac.\nMore sceptically, Tabataba’i and Mirsadri propose that the burūj refer to all of the constellations, w hether zodiacal\nor not (Tabataba’i and Mirsadri 2016, 215, n. 57). However, see Al- Jallad 2014b and 2016 on the constellations of\nthe zodiac in Safaitic inscriptions.\n412 samāʾ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This would\nseem to presuppose the Biblical notion that the firmament separates the w aters below from\nthe waters above (Gen 1:6–7).5 The Noachian flood illustrates that the sky is not only the\nsource of vivifying precipitation (e.g., Q 2:22, 30:24, 43:11, 45:5, 50:9, 71:11) but can also be\na source of divine punishments (apart from Q 54:11, see 2:59, 7:162, 8:32, 18:40, 29:34, and\n67:17).6 On the day of judgement, the flawless (Q 50:6, 67:3–4) and seemingly imperturbably\nstable celestial edifice w ill be utterly demolished (HCI 173): the heaven w ill sway to and fro\n(Q 52:9), it w ill melt (Q 70:8), it w ill be rolled up like a scroll (Q 21:104, 39:67), it w ill tear or\nbe split open (Q 25:25, 55:37, 69:16, 73:18, 77:9, 82:1, 84:1), it will be stripped away (Q 81:11),\nor it w ill be opened up (Q 78:19). This eschatological splitting or opening up of the celestial\nstructure allows the divine judge and his angelic hosts to descend upon earth (see Q 25:25)\nin order to judge the resurrected.\nThe heavenly dome in pre- Qur’anic Christian texts. The Qur’an’s pre sen ta tion of\nthe sky as a divinely crafted edifice has identifiable late antique precursors, a link that is\nalso demonstrated in recent publications by Julien Decharneux (Decharneux 2019 and\n2021). Thus, an architectural portrayal of the sky is espoused, based on Biblical data, by\na number of Syriac writers, like Narsai and Jacob of Sarug, who like the Qur’an call the\nheaven the world’s “roof” (McVey 1983, 98–99, 114–116, 117–118; van Bladel 2007, 225–226;\nsee also Mathews 2020, 32–33, l. 2037, and 44–45, l. 2136).7 The main competitor of this\nconception was the Aristotelian-P tolemaic model according to which the heavens form\nrevolving spheres around a spherical earth, a model that was to become dominant among\npost- Qur’anic Islamic phi los o phers and scientists (van Bladel 2007, 224–225 and 241–243;\nsee also Janos 2012a, 26–30, and Neuwirth 2001, 445). Strikingly, a Syriac hymn dating to\nthe middle of the sixth century and presenting the cathedral church of Edessa as a micro-\ncosm also stresses that its dome is “without columns” (d- lā ʿamūdē; cf. Qur’anic ʿamad),\nas do Cosmas Indicopleustes and Jacob of Sarug (McVey 1983, 99 and 115; see strophe 5 of\nher edition and translation; see also Decharneux 2019, 240–242). Such parallels make it\nunlikely that Q 13:2 and 31:10—a ccording to which God “raised” or “created” the heavens\n“without a pillar (ʿamad) that youp can see”— refer to an invisible pillar, as maintained in\nTabataba’i and Mirsadri 2016, 209, 216–217, and 220–221 (see also van Bladel 2007, 233).\nAlso recalling the Qur’an, the same strophe of the Syriac hymn just mentioned invokes\nthe notion that the cosmic firmament is “decorated” (verb: ṣabbet) with stars (kawkbē;\ncf. especially the combination of zayyana and kawākib in Q 37:6).8\nGiven the fairly compelling parallels just rehearsed, it is attractive to conjecture that\nthe Qur’an, too, understands the celestial ceiling to be a dome or vault (see also van Bladel\n5 It is tempting to connect Gen 1:6–7 with Qur’anic references to “two bodies of w ater” (al- baḥrān), one\nsalty and one “sweet,” that are separated by a barrier in Q 25:53, 27:61, 35:12, 55:19–20 (Neuwirth 2001, 443 and\n445–446).

In placing the Islamic scrip-\nture against this traditional background, it is expedient to begin with a brief overview of\nGod’s name in Biblical lit er a ture and in pre- Qur’anic inscriptions before inspecting the\nmain types of usage in the Qur’an itself. The pre sent entry will confine itself to Qur’anic\nstatements about God’s name or names as well as the names of other deities venerated\nin the Qur’anic milieu. Hence, statements about the naming or names of created entities\n(Q 2:31–33) and human individuals like John the Baptist and Mary (Q 3:36, 19:7, 61:6) will\nnot be considered.\nGod’s “name” in pre- Qur’anic traditions. Generally speaking, “the term ‘name’ in an-\ncient Near Eastern cultures can refer to the essence of any thing and hence can be a cipher\nfor the thing itself” (Sommer 2009, 59; see also NIDOTTE 4:147–149). Biblical lit er a ture\naccordingly preserves many examples in which God and God’s name figure synonymously\n(see, in addition to the examples quoted by Sommer, TDOT 15:136 and Grether 1934,\n35–43). A dif er ent usage is characteristic of the book of Deuteronomy, which treats God’s\n“name” as a hypostasis of God that is tied to the Jerusalem sanctuary, described as “the\nplace in which God will cause his name to dwell” (e.g., Deut 12:11, 13:12, and 14:23). The\nimplicit distinction between God and his “name” that undergirds such language resolves\nthe potential tension between God’s transcendence, on the one hand, and his presence at a\npar tic ul ar place, on the other, and thereby helps avoid unduly anthropomorphic depictions\nof God (Grether 1934, 31–35; Weinfeld 1992, 193–200; Barton and Muddiman 2001, 145).\n414 musammā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Greek\nand Syriac usage h ere reflects the fact that from a certain point in time the tetragrammaton\nYHWH was deemed to be too sacred to be pronounced and was accordingly substituted\nby the Hebrew word ӑdônāy (Parke- Taylor 1975, 79–88; Gese 1975, 88–89). Hellenistic\nand rabbinic Jewish writings attest to the awesome power that was believed to reside in\nGod’s name, a power that could give rise to magical practices (Urbach 1987, 1:124–134).\nLiturgically, God’s name is prominently invoked at the beginning of the Lord’s Prayer\n(“Hallowed be your name”; e.g., Matt 6:9) and in the Jewish Qaddish prayer, whose core\nblessing (“May his g reat name be blessed forever and all time”) has Biblical precursors\n(Daniel 2:20, Ps 113:2) and is attested as a formula of response already in b. Bәr. 3a (see\nElbogen 1931, 93).\nIn the late antique period, invocations of God’s “name” are detectable well beyond the\nJewish and Christian traditions. Palmyrene epigraphy documents worship of an unnamed\ngod who is periphrastically referred to as “the one whose name is blessed forever” (bryk\nšmh l-ʿ lmʾ) and who is perhaps to be identified with Baal Shamin or Yarḥibol (Drijvers 1976,\n15; Teixidor 1977, 122–130; Greenfield 2000, 385; Healey 2001, 96; Fox and Lieu 2005, 82).\nChronologically and spatially even closer to the Qur’an are Sabaic inscriptions from the\nrealm of Ḥimyar subsequent to the abandonment of its traditional polytheism in favour of\na Judaising version of mono thei sm. One inscription entreats God to grant the builders of a\nsynagogue “fear of his name” (Robin 2015a, 135), while another one opens with the eulogy\n“Blessed and praised be the name of the Merciful who is in heaven” (brk wtbrk s1m rḥmnn\nḏbs1myn; Abdallah 1987, 4–5; Gajda 2009, 232 and 247; Gajda 2017, 253). The latter phrase\nbears some resemblance to the first half of Q 55:78: tabāraka smu rabbika, “Blessed by the\nname of your Lord.”1 Fin ally, an unpublished Palaeo-A rabic inscription from the Ḥijāz opens\nwith the words “In your name, Allāh” (b- smk ʾllhm; see Al- Jallad and Sidky 2021, 9).\nEarly Meccan references to “the name of yourS Lord” (ism rabbika). In the Islamic\nscripture, the phrase ism rabbika, “the name of yourS Lord,” occurs almost exclusively in\nthe early Meccan surahs.2 In continuity with ancient Near Eastern usage, Qur’anic ref-\nerences to the Lord’s “name” are “a cipher for the thing itself” (to quote Sommer 2009,\n59), such that, for instance, the command to “praise (sabbiḥ bi- or sabbiḥ + acc.) the name\nof yourS Lord” (Q 56:74.96, 69:52, 87:1; see also u nder → ḥamd) may be treated as seman-\n1 Abdallah 1987, 5, points to Q 67:1 (tabāraka lladhī bi- yadihi l- mulku, “Blessed be he in whose hand is the\nkingship”), which unlike Q 55:78 functions as an opening formula, similar to the inscription at hand. For a dif er-\nent translation of the inscription, see Robin 2015a, 133: “May he bless and be blessed, the name of the Merciful\nwho is in heaven.” By contrast, Abdallah 1987, 5, interprets the initial brk as the Hebrew bārûk (cf. also Gajda\n2017, 253). One might perhaps also consider construing it as an internal passive (on which see Stein 2011, 1059,\nand Stein 2013, 85), along the lines of būrika in Q 27:8. This reasoning would appear to underlie Beeston et al.\n1982, 31. I am grateful to Peter Stein for answering queries on this difficult passage.\n2 Of the pertinent verses Q 55:78, 56:74.96, 69:52, 73:8, 76:25, 87:1.15, and 96:1, the only surah that is not early\nMeccan as defined in HCI 161 is Surah 76.

Other verbs collocating with “the name of your Lord” are tabāraka, “to\nbe blessed” (Q 55:78, quoted above), and → dhakara, “to invoke” (Q 73:8, 76:25, 87:15),\nboth of which also occur with God directly rather than only with his name (for tabāraka,\nsee, e.g., Q 7:54, 23:14, 25:1.10.61; for dhakara, see, e.g., Q 2:152.198.200.203, 17:46, 18:24).\nFi nally, in Q 96:1 “the name of yourS Lord” combines with → qaraʾa, which normally\nmeans “to recite” but may have a special sense here (see below). After the early Meccan\nperiod, the Qur’anic proclamations tend to supplant the expression ism rabbika by ref-\nerences to God himself, even if some later passages do feature the phrase ism allāh rather\nthan ism rabbika (see below).3\nEarly Meccan passages mentioning “the name of your Lord” have a discernibly Psal-\nmic flavour (see Baumstark 1927, 232, pointing out the particularly striking similarity\nbetween Ps 113:2 and Q 55:78, and PP 256, in connection with Q 87:1). This Psalmic ring\nis reinforced by the fact that some of the Arabic verbs associated with the phrase ism\nrabbika have Hebrew or Syriac cognates that appear in passages like Ps 105:1, 113:1.2, and\n119:55, namely, Hebrew qārāʾ / Syriac qrā (cf. Arabic qaraʾa), Syriac shabbaḥ (cf. Arabic\nsabbaḥa), and Hebrew zākar (cf. Arabic dhakara). “Blessing,” “praising,” and “invoking”\nGod’s name are all h uman speech acts, possibly performed at regular diurnal prayer times,\nas shown by Q 76:25: “Invoke the name of yourS Lord in the morning and in the eve ning.”\nThis putative Psalmic background contrasts with the Deuteronomistic conception of the\nLord’s name as a divine hypostasis, which seems far less pertinent to the Qur’an.\nIqraʾ bi- smi rabbika, “Proclaim the name of yourS Lord” (Q 96:1). In four places, the\nphrase ism rabbika is governed by the preposition bi-: Q 96:1 has iqraʾ bi- smi rabbika, while\nQ 56:74.96 and 69:52 all have sabbiḥ bi- smi rabbika l-ʿ aẓīm. In the latter three cases, it is\nnatu ral to construe ism rabbika as a prepositional object of the preceding verb sabbaḥa,\nyielding the translation “Praise the name of yourS mighty Lord”: sabbiḥ bi- smi rabbika in\nQ 56:74.96 and 69:52 is evidently synonymous with sabbiḥi sma rabbika in Q 87:1, where\nsabbaḥa takes a direct object rather than a prepositional one. The same understanding is\nnaturally extended to Q 96:1, such that iqraʾ bi- smi rabbika would mean “Recite/proclaim/\ncall upon the name of yourS Lord.” In support of the same conclusion, Hirschfeld points to\nQ 96:1’s isomorphism with the Hebrew phrase qārāʾ bəšēm YHWH (Peshitta: qrā b- shmeh\nd- māryā; Hirschfeld 1902, 18–19 and 32), used in the Hebrew Bible as a metonymy for the\nworship of YHWH in general (e.g., Gen 4:26, 12:8, 13:4, and 21:33; see also Grether 1934,\n18–19; Gese 1975, 86–88; TDOT 15:155). The alternative position, adopted by Schwally, is\nto render Q 96:1 as “Recite in the name of yourS Lord,” given that the general meaning\nof → qaraʾa in the Qur’an (e.g., in Q 16:98, 17:93, 69:19 etc.) is “to recite” (GQ 1:32–33 and\n81–82). Schwally quite correctly highlights that Hirschfeld’s interpretation would result in\nattributing to Q 96:1 “an entirely isolated use of language.” It remains nonetheless attractive\nto conjecture that Q 96:1 Arabises the injunction to “call upon” God’s “name” that is found,\ne.g., in Ps 105:1 (Hebrew: qirʾû bišmô, Peshitta: qraw shmeh), resulting in an exception to\nthe ordinary Qur’anic meaning of qaraʾa.

A second characteristic Qur’anic usage of the\nnoun ism in relation to God is to pair it not with rabbika, “yourS Lord,” but with the divine\nname allāh. The resulting expression ism allāh, “God’s name,” is, unlike ism rabbika, not\nlimited to early Meccan passages. It can figure as the direct object of the verb → dhakara,\n“to invoke”— for instance, in commandments to invoke “God’s name” over slaughtered\nanimals (e.g., Q 5:4, 6:118–119.121.138, 22:28.34.36; for other contexts, see 2:114, 22:40,\nand 24:36). Ism allāh can also be governed by the preposition bi- , yielding the phrase bi-\nsmi llāhi. The latter occurs most frequently in the surah-i nitial basmalah (→ ˻bi- smi llāhi\nl-r aḥmāni l-r aḥīm), in addition to two further occurrences inside surahs, Q 27:30 and\n11:41. Q 27:30 has the full basmalah formula, opening a letter by Solomon to the queen of\nSabaʾ. As argued in my treatment of the basmalah as a w hole, Q 27:30 likely constitutes\nthe phrase’s original occurrence in the Qur’an and echoes the invocatory conventions of\nSouth Arabian inscriptions. Specifically, the “asyntactic” character of the full basmalah\nformula in Q 27:30 is likely related to the opening b- of South Arabian inscriptions (Stein\n2013, 93–94). It was from Q 27:30 that the basmalah invocation was subsequently excerpted\nto function as a prefatory invocation preceding almost all Qur’anic surahs.\nQ 11:41, which postdates 27:30, recounts how Noah invites members of his family and\nother believers to board his ark, adding that “it w ill it run its course and find anchorage in\nGod’s name” (bi-s mi llāhi majrāhā wa-m ursāhā).5 This is the only Qur’anic instance in which\nthe formula bi-s mi llāhi may be understood to be syntactically integrated into a complete\nsentence, even if a dif ere nt grammatical analy sis is pos sib le (Ṭab. 12:413–414; see also Zam.\n3:199–200). Bi- smi llāhi has a clear counterpart in Biblical usage, namely, Hebrew bəšēm\nYHWH / Syriac b- shmeh d- māryā / Greek en onomati kyriou, although it is notable that the\nBible only uses the phrase with accompanying verbs (GQ 1:116–117). Examples include Deut\n18:22 (in combination with dibbēr, “to speak”; see also Exod 5:23), 1 Sam 17:45 (with bāʾ, “to\ncome”), 1 Kgs 18:32 (in connection with building), and Col 3:17 (“what ever you do, in word\nor deed, do every thing in the name of the Lord Jesus”), as well as the Psalmic benediction\n“Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord” (Ps 118:26), which is cited in Matt 21:9\nand 23:39 and thence penetrated into Christian liturgy.\nGod’s “most excellent names.” Apart from the singular usage discussed so far (the\nname of God), the Qur’an also evinces an awareness that God is in fact referred to by a\nplurality of linguistic expressions. “To God belong the most excellent [or: most beautiful]\nnames” (li- llāhi/lahu l- asmāʾu l- ḥusnā), four verses declare (Q 7:180, 17:110, 20:8, 59:24).\n4 In favour of Hirschfeld’s understanding of bi- smi rabbika as forming a prepositional object, one may also\npoint out that in the rendering favoured by Nöldeke and Schwally (“Recite in the name of your Lord”), the\ncommand expressed by Q 96:1 patently lacks an object: what, precisely, is to be recited? Of course, if one w ere\nto read Surah 96 in light of the well- known extra- Qur’anic narrative about Muhammad’s first revelation atop\nMount Ḥirāʾ (Schoeler 2011, 38–79), then the object of recitation is the writing contained on a piece of brocade\n(namaṭ min dībāj fīhi kitāb) that the angel Gabriel allegedly presented to Muhammad (Wüstenfeld 1858–1860,\n1:152). Yet given that this narrative detail has no presence in the Qur’anic text (see already Nöldeke 1860, 64), it\nis preferable to consider the object of recitation, invocation, or proclamation to be specified by bi- smi rabbika,\nhence: “Proclaim/call upon the name of your Lord.”\n5 I am here departing from the reading majrēhā that is attributed to Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim, e.g., in Ibn Mujāhid\n1972, 333.\nism 417", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Omitting vari ous surrounding and intervening segments of text, this sequence of\n“excellent names” in Q 59:23–24 can be partitioned as follows:\n- al- malik al- quddūs: “holy king” (see under → qaddasa; cf. the parallel in Q 62:1);\n- al- salām al- muʾmin al- muhaymin: “[bestower of?] salvific safety, trustworthy granter\nof security” (→ salām, → āmana, → muhaymin);\n- al-ʿ azīz al- jabbār al- mutakabbir: “the mighty, the power ful, the exalted” (→ jabbār);\n- al-k hāliq al-b āriʾ al-m uṣawwir: “the creator, the maker, the shaper [of humans]”\n(→ khalaqa; on ṣawwara, see under → istakhlafa).\nOne infers that God’s “most excellent names” are attributes (Böwering 2002, 319) ex-\npressing his holiness and numinous power as well as salient aspects of his relationship\nto humans. It seems likely that the hymnic predications that close out many Qur’anic\nverses— such as the affirmation that God is “the one who hears and knows” (al- samīʿ al-\nʿalīm) or, without the definite article, “hearing and knowing” (e.g., Q 2:127.137.181.224.227,\n3:34.35.121)— may likewise be considered to fall under the rubric of God’s “most excellent\nnames” (for an overview of such verse- final epithets, refer to Robinson 2003a, 198–201;\nsee also Neuwirth 2007, 161–163, and the enumeration of Qur’anic divine attributes in\nBöwering 2002, 320–322). After all, at least ʿazīz, one of the epithets from Q 59:24, is\nalso frequent in verse-fi nal hymnic predications (e.g., Q 2:129.209.220.228, 3:4.6.18.62;\nnote again the partial overlap between 59:24 and 62:1). God’s “most excellent names” are\ntherefore hymnic epithets articulating divine qualities like holiness, power, omniscience/\nomnipercipience, or beneficence. Grammatically, the expressions in question function as\npredicates, whose associated subject terms are usually → allāh, “God,” “yourS (or my or\nhis etc.) Lord” (inna → rabbī/rabbaka . . .), or simply the third- person singular pronoun\n“he” (see the linguistic taxonomy in Neuwirth 2007, 161–162). Unlike later attempts to\nquantify and exhaustively enumerate God’s “most excellent names” (van Ess 2017–2020,\n4:479–480), the Qur’an nowhere indicates that such predicates or attributes of divine\nexcellence are to be drawn from a finite list.\nAn even more impor tant observation to make, in view of the frequency of such divine\npredications in the Qur’an and also in view of the four verses mentioning God’s “most ex-\ncellent names,” is to note that the Islamic scripture does not evince any sort of principled\nuneasiness over the application of human language to the divine, uneasiness of the sort\nthat might be cultivated by Neoplatonically inspired proponents of a more apophatic or\nnegative approach to discourse about God.6 Rather, the Qur’an positively urges its recip-\nients to “call upon God” by his “most excellent names” (Q 7:180; cf. 17:110): expressions\nthat designate what is a perfection for human agents, one might reformulate, are readily\ntransposable— and indeed o ught to be transposed—to the divine. Ibn Taymiyyah derives\na similar princi ple from Q 16:60 (cf. 30:27), according to which “to God belongs the loft-\niest characterisation” (li- llāhi l- mathalu l- aʿlā; Hoover 2007, 58–59)—to translate freely,\n“Of God, one must only say the best” (see also u nder → mathal). The point of predicative\n6 This is so despite the statement in Q 42:11 that “nothing is like” God (see u nder → allāh) and despite the\nQur’an’s condemnation of its opponents for employing mere “names that youp and your forefathers have devised”\nand that lack divine authorisation (see below).\n418 ism", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

These are l imited to → allāh, → rabb + per-\nsonal suffix, and → al- raḥmān, “the Merciful” (e.g., Q 19:61.75.88.96, 20:5). Nonetheless,\nQ 17:110 invokes the princi ple that God merits “the most excellent names” specifically in\nconnection with the question which of the two divine names allāh and al- raḥmān—w hich\nseem to have begun to coalesce into alternative designations of the creator deity already\nin the pre- Islamic period (→ ˻bi- smi llāhi l- raḥmāni l- raḥīm)—is preferable: “Say, ‘Callp\nupon God or call upon the Merciful; whichever you call upon, to him belong the most\nexcellent names.’ And do not sayS your prayer too loudly nor whisper it, but adopt a m iddle\ncourse.” Q 17:110 is not the chronologically earliest occurrence of the most- excellent- names\nprinci ple, which is also found in Q 20:8 (“God—t here is no God but him; to him belong\nthe most excellent names”). What Q 17:110 does, therefore, is to apply the most- excellent-\nnames princip le to apparent uncertainty regarding which one of the Qur’an’s main divine\nnames, “God” or “the Merciful,” should take pre ce dence over the other. The issue in the\nbackground may have been specifically how God ought to be addressed in prayer.8\n“Only names that youp have devised.” As we have seen, the Qur’an treats allāh and al-\nraḥmān as referentially equivalent and as equally capable of picking out the one true divine\ncreator and judge. This is not the case for other elem ents of h uman religious language, for\nseveral passages charge the opponents of the Qur’anic Messenger with employing mere\nnames or “empty concepts” (QP 74) that have no referential correspondence in real ity.\nThus, three passages (Q 7:71, 12:40, 53:23) charge the Qur’anic adversaries with using or\nworshipping “names that youp and your forefathers have devised” (asmāʾ sammaytumūhā\nantum wa-ā bāʾukum; → ab) and for whom “God has not sent down any authority” (mā\nnazzala/anzala llāhu bihā min sulṭānin; → sulṭān), while a later verse in Surah 53 accuses\nthose who “do not believe in the hereafter” of “calling the angels by female names” (Q 53:27:\n7 In post- Qur’anic Islamic thought, the frequency of divine predication in the Qur’an and the overt call to\nmake use of God’s “most excellent names” provided an impor tant anti-a pophatic impetus, culminating in the\nAshʿarite doctrine of a plurality of entitative attributes that are additional to God’s essence and eternally subsist\nin him (van Ess 2017–2020, 4:477–478). In view of what has just been said, this kind of theorising—w hatever\nits specific formulations and the concomitant theoretical impasses—a rguably preserves aspects of the Qur’an’s\ngeneral anti- apophatic spirit.\n8 Note the density of diction associated with worship in vv. 107–111, such as kharra, “to fall down,” sujjad\n(the plural of sājid, “prostrating”; → sajada), subḥāna . . . (“Praise be to . . .”; see under → ḥamd), daʿā, “to call\nupon,” → ḥamd, “praise,” and kabbara, “to magnify.” According to an alternative and stronger reading of Q 17:110,\nit reflects uncertainty over the referential equivalence of the two divine names in question, i.e., it addresses the\nquestion whether they designate one and the same deity. However, such a reading is primarily rooted in extra-\nQur’anic traditions of doubtful authenticity, according to which the pagan Meccans, when overhearing Muham-\nmad invoke both “God” and “the Merciful,” misunderstood him to be appealing to two dif ere nt deities (e.g., Ṭab.\n15:123–124; see also Jomier 1957, 366).

How-\never, at least the superscript Q 24:1, which calls the following a sūrah “in which” (fīhā)\nGod has “sent down clear signs (āyāt),” provides a strong indication that it is the whole of\nSurah 24 that qualifies as a sūrah rather than merely some part of it. The same verse also\nsuggests that the word sūrah refers a piece of text more extensive than one designated by\nthe word → āyah (e.g., Q 2:106). It is admittedly not certain that Q 24:1 employs āyah in\na textual sense; the verse could simply be saying that the sūrah to follow recounts God’s\nsigns. Still, it is notable that when the singular āyah occurs in a manifestly textual sense\nat Q 16:101, it is plausibly understood to designate a segment of text that might be fairly\nshort, in contrast to the singular use of sūrah in Q 24:1.\nEtymology. It is not immediately obvious how the meaning of sūrah just outlined might\nbe elucidated by linking it to other words of Qur’anic Arabic that share its consonantal\nroot, such as sūr, “wall” (Q 57:13), or tasawwara, “to enter a building by climbing over\n420 sunnah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Western scholars have therefore made vari ous attempts\nto derive the word sūrah from Hebrew or Syriac (NB 26; GQ 1:30–31; JPND 211–212; Bell\n1926, 52; FVQ 180–182; Watt 1970, 58). Specifically, Syriac sūrṭā, derived from the root s- r-ṭ ,\nmeans a line, including a line of writing (SL 990–991; sraṭ is “to scratch, to write”). This\nleads Jefery to declare this Syriac word the most probable ancestor of the Qur’anic one.\nEarlier scholars, by contrast, link sūrah to the rabbinic Hebrew term shurah, belonging\nto the consonantal root sh- w- r and signifying “line” or “row” and also “line of conduct”\n(DTTM 1542).1 In Babylonian Jewish Aramaic, too, shurta means a “row” (DJBA 1125; on\nits Palestinian Aramaic counterpart, see DJPA 542).\nWhile it is hardly impossible to produce a speculative narrative about how e ither the\nSyriac or the Hebrew word might have given rise to an Arabic term that subsequently\nmorphed into a Qur’anic designation for a unit of divine revelation, one is tempted to side\nwith Ambros that none of the derivations hitherto proposed are fully satisfactory (CDKA\n141). Rather than pursuing an etymological crux that may ultimately be insoluble, it seems\nsafer to confine oneself to noting the partial synonymity between the terms sūrah, ḥadīth\n(“discourse”), → kitāb (“scripture”), and also qurʾān (“recitation”; → qaraʾa), which are,\nfor instance, employed interchangeably in a number of passages challenging the Qur’anic\naddressees to “bring” a sūrah/discourse/scripture that is “like” the Qur’anic proclamations\nor “provides better guidance” (e.g., Q 2:23, 28:49, 52:34; Radscheit 1996a, 95; Radscheit\n1996b, 123; cf. also Q 17:88, asserting the impossibility that humans and the jinn might join\nforces to “bring something like this qurʾān”). Despite the etymological enigma attaching\nto the word sūrah, therefore, we have at least a reasonably firm grasp of its semantic value\nin Qur’anic usage.\nsāʿah | hour\nal- sāʿah | the hour (of the resurrection)\nFurther vocabulary discussed: yawm al-d īn | the day of judgement ḥisāb | reckon-\ning, account y awm al- qiyāmah | t he day of resurrection r ayb | doubt q arīb | n ear\niqtaraba intr. | t o draw near b aghtatan | suddenly k a- lamḥ al-baṣar | l ike the glance\nof an eye ashrāṭ pl. | signs, portents\nOverview of Qur’anic usage. Sāʿah means “hour,” both in the sense of a short period\nof time and in that of a specific (though temporally extended) moment in time (e.g.,\nQ 7:34, 9:117, 10:45.49). “The hour,” with the definite article, is a predominantly Mec-\ncan designation of the eschatological resurrection and judgement, also referred to by\nother expressions like yawm al-d īn, “the day of judgement” (→ dīn1), God’s “reckoning”\n(→ ḥisāb), or the “day of resurrection” (→ yawm al- ˻qiyāmah). Q 30:55 puns on this dou-\nble meaning of the word by saying that “on the day on which the hour [or resurrection]\nwill arise (yawma taqūmu l-s āʿatu), the sinners will swear that they only lingered [in their\ngraves] for an hour (mā labithū ghayra sāʿatin)” (Rippin 1994, 197). “The hour” figures\nfrom the early Meccan period onwards (Q 15:85, 54:1.46, 79:42). Three occurrences of\n“the hour” in a surah customarily dated to the Medinan period come at Q 22:1.7.55, but\n1 On šûrâ in Biblical Hebrew (Job 24:11), see HALOT 1453–1454 and NIDOTTE 4:73–74.\nsāʿah 421", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This only leaves Q 33:63 and 47:18 as plausible Medinan\noccurrences of “the hour.”\nA digest of Qur’anic statements about the eschatological “hour.” It is repeatedly\nstressed that the hour of resurrection and judgement will certainly come (Q 15:85, 20:15,\n22:7, 40:59: inna/anna l- sāʿata ±​<la-> ātiyatun). There can be “no doubt about” it, four\nverses aver (Q 18:21, 22:7, 40:59, 45:32: lā rayba fīhā; see also u nder → irtāba), while o thers\nwarn that “the hour” may be (→ laʿalla) “near” (qarīb; Q 33:63, 42:17) or, as the early\nMeccan verse Q 54:1 puts it even more categorically, that “the hour” has in fact “drawn\nnear” (iqtarabat). The coming of the hour will be sudden (Q 6:31, 7:187, 12:107, 16:77,\n22:55, 43:66, 47:18: baghtatan),1 “like the glance of an eye” or even faster (Q 16:77: wa- mā\namru l- sāʿati illā ka- lamḥi l- baṣari aw huwa aqrabu; cf. 54:50). One of the passages just\ncited, the Medinan verse Q 47:18, additionally maintains that the “portents” (ashrāṭ) of the\nhour have already come to pass (qad jāʾa). This indicates that the imminent eschatologi-\ncal expectation that shines through in the early Meccan verse Q 54:1 cannot be assumed\nto have faded a fter the hijrah (see also u nder → ittaqā). It is true that other Meccan and\nMedinan passages insist that no one but God knows the exact time of the hour’s coming\n(Q 7:187, 31:34, 33:63, 41:47, 43:85, 79:42–45). Yet in Jacob of Sarug, too, agnosticism about\nthe precise timing of the end of the world can combine with anticipation that the end is\nimpending (Sinai 2017a, 237); the two positions are not incompatible, and one cannot as-\nsume that the former entails a dilution of the latter. Overall, passages like Q 54:1 and 47:18\nmake it necessary to concur with Stephen Shoemaker that the importance of imminent\neschatological expectation as a likely catalyst of Muhammad’s prophetic preaching should\nnot be downplayed (Shoemaker 2012, 121–127 and 158–171).2 In any case, regardless of when\nprecisely the world will come to an end, from a subjective perspective God’s eschatological\njudgement is as near to every one as his or her individual demise, since to the resurrected it\nwill appear that the period of time intervening between their death and their rising from\nthe grave was only a single night or even an hour (e.g., Q 10:45, 79:46; see Andrae 1926,\n156–163; O’Shaughnessy 1969, 69–70; Sinai 2017a, 238).3\nNew Testamental background. Qur’anic references to “the hour” have patent parallels\nin New Testamental language, which have been noted as early as Ahrens (CQ 165, 167).\nWhen the Qur’an announces that the hour “is coming” (ātiyah), this may be considered\nan Arabic counterpart of John 5:25 (hoti erchetai hōra, “that the hour is coming”). The\nPeshitta’s rendering of this Biblical formulation, by d-ā tyā shāʿtā, is particularly close to\nthe Qur’anic motto that “the hour is coming,” cited above. The proposition that knowl-\nedge of “the day and the hour” is reserved for God the Father alone is asserted in Matt\n24:36 and Mark 13:32, similar to Qur’anic verses like Q 7:187 (see also El-B adawi 2014,\n188–189), and is discussed by Ephrem and by Jacob of Sarug (Beck 1955, nos 77–79; Sinai\n2017a, 249). The frequent Qur’anic threats that the hour or God’s punishment will come\nsuddenly (baghtatan) may be related to Mark 13:36, which in the context of a parable about\n1 Cf. also Q 6:44.47, 7:95, 21:40, 26:202, 29:53, 39:55, where baghtatan qualifies the coming of God’s “pun-\nishment” (ʿadhāb) or the like.\n2 But see the reservations about details of his analy sis that are expressed in Sinai 2017a, 237, n. 75.\n3 To give a more comprehensive list of Qur’anic passages, see Q 10:45, 46:35, 79:46 (lam yalbathū illā\nsāʿatan / ʿashiyyatan aw ḍuḥāhā), 17:52, 20:103.104 (in labithtum illā qalīlā / qalīlan / ʿashrā / yawmā), as well\nas 23:112–114 and 30:55.\n422 sāʿah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Much of the Qur’an, especially the Meccan Qur’an, is engaged in polemical alter-\ncations with a group of opponents who are accused of “associating” or “partnering” (ashraka)\nother gods with Allāh and on whom Gerald Hawting and Patricia Crone have done pivotal\nwork (Hawting 1999, 45–66; QP). By contrast with the Qur’an’s own insistence, from the\nend of the early Meccan period onwards, that Allāh is the only divine being to be served and\nvenerated, the opponents attacked in the Meccan surahs worship a plurality of divine partner\ngods or “associates” (shurakāʾ; e.g., Q 13:16.33, 16:27.86, 28:62.64.74; for the singular sharīk,\nsee Q 6:163, 17:111, and 25:2). As two Medinan verses stress, “associating” or “partnering”\nsome other being with God is the one cardinal sin that God w ill not forgive (Q 4:48.116:\ninna llāha lā yaghfiru an yushraka bihi wa-y aghfiru mā dūna dhālika li-m an yashāʾu). From\nthe vantage point of the late Qur’an, therefore, the transgression of associationism ranks in\nseverity above any other h uman misdeed, and “whoever associates [anything] with God,\nGod w ill deny him the garden [of paradise], and his refuge w ill be the fire” (Q 5:72: innahu\nman yushrik bi- llāhi fa- qad ḥarrama llāhu ʿalayhi l- jannata wa- maʾwāhu l- nāru). The error or,\nas one might say, heresy of associationism is an ancient one (Linnhof 2020, 20): it blighted\nthe religious praxis of “most” e arlier communities (Q 30:42; see also 40:82–84), including\nthe p eople of Phar aoh (Q 40:42), and miscellaneous past figures like Abraham, Joseph, Hūd,\nand Luqmān are accordingly depicted as steadfastly refusing to “associate” anything e lse with\nGod (e.g., Q 6:78–81, 11:54, 12:38, 16:123, 22:26, 31:13). Indeed, the tendency to lapse into\nassociationism appears almost like a congenital h uman weakness, a disastrous predisposi-\ntion to deny God’s uniqueness that conflicts with and continuously threatens to undermine\nhumans’ immanent teleological orientation t owards mono thei sm, which Q 30:30 describes\nas their divinely given “creaturely constitution” (fiṭrah; see u nder → ḥanīf).\nIt is clear that the Qur’an’s interest in highlighting past cases of associationism and of\nre sis tance to it stems from its polemical dispute with cont emporary associators. These\nfigure both as al- mushrikūn (e.g., Q 2:105.135.221, 41:6, 42:13) and as alladhīna ashrakū (e.g.,\nQ 2:96, 3:186, 5:82, 16:35.86), two expressions that are efectively synonymous (Reuschel\n1996, 143–156). References to “the repudiators” (alladhīna kafarū; → kafara) and also to\n“the deniers” (al- mukadhdhibūn; e.g., Q 52:11, 77:15.19.24 etc., and 83:10; → kadhdhaba)\nare reasonably considered to be alternative designations of roughly the same group.1 The\n1 The proximity of kafara and ashraka emerges, e.g., from Q 3:151, 24:55, 40:42, or 52:42–43.

This is reminiscent of the manner in which\n“the believers” and “the associators” figure as separate collective identities in the Medinan\nverses Q 2:221, 5:82, 9:28.113, or 22:17.2 Elsewhere in the Constitution of Medina (§ 15),\n“believers” are opposed to “repudiators,” which further supports the referential equiv-\nalence of “associators” and “repudiators.” A number of Medinan verses unequivocally\ndistinguish “the associators” from Jews (→ al- yahūd) and from Christians (→ al- naṣārā;\ne.g., Q 5:82; see also Gimaret 1997, 485). This bolsters the claim, further developed below,\nthat when the Qur’an speaks of “the associators” as a concrete collective, the expression\nis not merely a cipher for Jews or Christians who are deemed to fall short of the Qur’an’s\nown conception of mono the ism.\nGiven the length of the pre sent entry, it is expedient to supply an introductory epitome\nof the ground to be covered in what follows. A fter beginning with an examination of the\nchronologically earliest Qur’anic occurrences of the root sh-r -k , I go on to discuss the\ndeities venerated by Muhammad’s associating opponents and to identify par tic ul ar beliefs\nthat were likely held or rejected by these opponents. Based on this doxographic profile,\nand in line with an earlier publication (HCI 65–72), I infer that the Qur’anic associators\nare best viewed as syncretistic pagans. This general line of argument, it must be conceded,\npresupposes that we may responsibly attempt to combine what dif ere nt Qur’anic passages\nsay about Muhammad’s “associating” or “repudiating” opponents into a unitary theological\nprofile, rather than supposing from the outset that we are faced with distinct groups of\nantagonists who held dif ere nt and potentially incompatible beliefs.3 Still, the assumption\nthat the Qur’an is by and large concerned with the same set of associating adversaries\nthroughout is, I would submit, retrospectively borne out by the fact that the approach\njust described yields a reasonably coherent theology, even though the possibility of some\nmea sure of doctrinal heterogeneity among the associators will be duly noted.\nThe following analy sis, then, accepts—at least for the sake of argument— that the\nQur’anic habit of referring to “the associators” as if they constitute a fairly unitary group\nof opponents sharing the same basic outlook on t hings divine does not speciously lump\ntogether a variety of doctrinally heterogeneous factions. It is nonetheless vital not to\noverlook that the label as such is very unlikely to be a neutral reflection of the manner in\nwhich the opponents in questions were wont to define themselves: the notion of illicit\n“association,” like that of “repudiation,” is a polemical concept, and it is in fact quite\nprobable that the associators did not primarily identify themselves in religious (as opposed\nto tribal) terms at all.4 This makes it pertinent to won der whence the Qur’an’s polemical\n2 “Believing” in God or in his signs and “associating” other beings with him function as antonyms already in\nMeccan passages like Q 23:58–59, 29:7–9, 40:84, or 72:2. But see Q 12:106: “Most of them do not believe in God\nwithout associating [other beings with him].” This could suggest that associationism is not as such incompatible\nwith some mea sure of belief in God, even though it will of course gravely taint such belief.\n3 This premise is astutely identified in Linnhof 2020, 33.\n4 Linnhof observes that Q 6:148 has the associators themselves employ the language of association, by\nanticipating that they “ will say” (sa- yaqūlu lladhīna ashrakū), “Had God willed, neither we nor our forefathers\nwould have associated [anything with him], and we would not have declared anything to be forbidden” (law shāʾa\nllāhu mā ashraknā wa- lā ābāʾunā wa- lā ḥarramnā min shayʾin; Linnhof 2020, 34–35). But even if the associators\ndid indeed express themselves in the very same terms quoted in Q 6:148, it is likely that the utterance is reactive\nand adopts Qur’anic diction. It should also be noted that Q 16:35 and 43:20 cite what is in substance the same\nashraka 427", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Their general policy may be a carry- over\nfrom Bell, even though the latter vacillates between “idolater” and “polytheist” (e.g., Bell\n1937, 1:51, on Q 3:60 = 3:67, and Bell 1937, 1:173, on Q 9:1–7). Yet as Hawting observes quite\nrightly, the literal meaning of the verb ashraka or the noun shirk, which is twice in the Qur’an\nemployed as if it w ere the verbal noun of ashraka (Q 31:13, 35:14),5 is neither “idolatry” nor\n“polytheism” (Hawting 1999, 48–49; see also Linnhof 2020, 22).\n“Idolatry,” of course, is an intrinsically inimical and also imprecise category. But even if\none were to disregard this and seek to define the term analytically as the religious worship\nof statues or other artefacts, there is little positive evidence in the Qur’an that artefact-\nworship was in fact the most prominent aspect of the associators’ ritual life: though they\nare linked with sacrificial stones (singular: nuṣub), references to “idols” properly speaking\n(singular: ṣanam or wathan) are almost exclusively confined to the distant past, the one\npos si ble exception being a call to “shun the impurity of idols” in Q 22:30 (for more detail,\nsee under → dhabaḥa). This is not necessarily to say that statues representing deities and\nworshipped as such did not have a place in the cultic practices current in the Qur’anic\nmilieu; but it is vital to avoid giving En glish readers of the Qur’an the mistaken impression\nthat the question w hether Muhammad’s Meccan adversaries w ere engaged in practices\nqualifying as “idolatrous” (what ever that might be) can be settled merely by pointing to\nthe Qur’an’s frequent mentions of alladhīna ashrakū and al- mushrikūn. The fact that the\nQur’anic notion of shirk cannot be equated with idolatry in any literal sense is, moreover,\nevident in verses that apply the concept of shirk to the Christian divinisation of Jesus Christ\n(Q 5:72, 9:31) and to an alleged Jewish and Christian penchant to set up religious dignitaries\nas “lords besides God” (arbāban min dūni llāhi; Q 9:31; cf. 3:64).6 The accusation at stake\nis evidently not that Christians worship graven images of Jesus but rather that they posit\nthe existence of a divine being other than the creator Allāh.\nargument (to wit: God, being omnipotent, could have put a stop to the worship of other deities; therefore, their\ncult may be regarded to have received God’s approval), but do so without recourse to the verb ashraka, employ-\ning ʿabada (“to serve, to worship”) instead. In light of this, it is conceivable that in employing the verb ashraka,\nQ 6:148 is reformulating the associators’ argument in Qur’anic language. The same would seem to be the case\nin Q 16:86, where the associators are depicted, at the moment of their posthumous judgement, as pointing out\nto God “our associates (shurakāʾunā), upon whom we used to call besides you.” On Q 6:148, 16:35, and 43:20,\nsee also under → ab.\n5 But see Q 34:22, 35:40, and 46:4, where shirk refers to the false deities’ non- existing “share” or “partner-\nship” in the heavens and the earth. On shirk in the sense of ishrāk, see also Gimaret 1997, 485, noting that it is the\nḥadīth “which has imposed the usage of shirk in the factitive (and religious) sense of the term.”\n6 On the phrase min dūn allāh, see generally Ambros 2001 and also below.\n428 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, the\ntranslation “polytheist,” too, has disadvantages, quite apart from the fact that it fails to\nsignal that the Arabic expressions alladhīna ashrakū and al- mushrikūn are derived from the\nverb ashraka. A more satisfactory approach, therefore, is to adopt periphrastic translations\nlike “ those who associate o thers with God” (Jones 2007) or “t hose who ascribe divinity\nto other beings beside God” (Asad 1980).7 The pre sent work follows a similar approach,\nthough I abbreviate “ those who associate others with God” to “the associators.”\nThe earliest Qur’anic occurrences of ashraka and mushrik. Assuming that mean verse\nlength is an approximate indicator of the relative chronology of Qur’anic surahs, the earliest\noccurrences of the verb ashraka and the plural noun shurakāʾ, “associates,” may well be the\nearly Meccan verses Q 52:43 and 68:41.8 The former passage asks w hether “they”—i .e., the\nQur’anic opponents whom the preceding verse, v. 42, also describes as “the repudiators”\n(alladhīna kafarū; → kafara)— “have a god other than God” and then adds, “Glory be to\nGod above what they associate [with him]” (subḥāna llāhi ʿammā yushrikūn). Q 68:41,\nmeanwhile, interrogates the Qur’anic opponents whether they have “associates” and then\nchallenges them to “produce their associates if they speak the truth” (am lahum shurakāʾu\nfa-l -y aʾtū bi-s hurakāʾihim in kānū ṣādiqīn). Both verses are roughly cont emporary with\npassages reflecting the early Qur’an’s seminal shift to explicit assertions of mono the ism\nand an unequivocal denial of deities other than Allāh (Q 37:4, 51:51, 53:19–22, 73:9; see\nParet 1957, 62, 92–94, and HCI 174–176).9 Within the Qur’an, therefore, the concept of an\nillicit “partnering” of God with other beings surfaces in close temporal conjunction with\nthe Qur’an’s incipient criticism of worshipping beings other than Allāh. It is very clear\nalready from the passages just examined that the concept of “associating” or “partnering”\nhas a polemical thrust: the label is one that is deployed from the vantage point of Qur’anic\nmono the ism.\nThe emergence of the collective label “the associators” is secondary to the first appear-\nance of the verb ashraka and the plural shurakāʾ in the context of anti- polytheistic polem-\nics. The putatively earliest occurrence of a plural form of the active participle mushrik is\nQ 15:94,10 commanding the Messenger to “turn away from t hose who associate” (wa- aʿriḍ ʿani\nl- mushrikīn), whom v. 96 further describes as “t hose who set up some other god with God.”\nThis is in fact the only early Meccan occurrence of mushrik, and subsequent references to\n7 Similarly Zirker 2018. On a few occasions, Jones does plump for “the polytheists” instead (e.g., Jones 2007,\non Q 9:1.3–7.17.28, 98:1.6). This could be due to the residual influence of Bell’s translation.\n8 The mean verse length of Surah 52 (excepting v. 21, which is prob ably an addition) is 38.35 transliteration\nletters, while that of Surah 68 is 37.04 (see HCI 114–117).\n9 The mean verse length of Surah 37 is 31.20 transliteration letters, that of Surah 51 is 37.77, that of Surah 53\n(not taking into account vv. 23 and 26–32) is 24.09, and that of Surah 73 (excluding v. 20) is 41.11.\n10 The mean verse length of Surah 15 is 43.12 transliteration letters.\nashraka 429", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

By the Medinan\nperiod, however, this has changed, as illustrated by Q 22:17, where “the associators” figure\nalongside a number of other religious communities, namely, the Qur’anic “believers,” the\nJews, the → ṣābiʾūn, the Christians, and the “Magians” or Zoroastrians (al- majūs; cf. Syriac\nmgūshē). Hence, it is almost certainly Qur’anic discourse that progressively constructs “the\nassociators” as a quasi- communal identity on a par with Judaism or Christ ian ity. That this\ncorresponded in any way to the self- understanding of the associators themselves is, at the\nvery least, uncertain.\nWhich partner deities did the Qur’anic associators worship? As Crone has under-\nlined, the Qur’anic charge of illicit theological association does not mean that the associ-\nators accorded no veneration at all to Allāh. Rather, they venerated their partner deities\ntogether “with” (maʿa) him (Q 6:19, 15:96, 17:22.39, and 72:18; see QP 52–101, especially\n61–64). Other passages condemn the worship of deities min dūn allāh, which for con-\ntextual reasons is often best understood as “besides God” (i.e., as roughly equivalent to\nmaʿa) rather than “instead of God” (e.g., Q 11:54–55, 16:35, and 39:3.43; see Ambros 2001\nand also QP 61–62).12 In fact, as we shall see in more detail below, the associators clearly\nrecognised Allāh as the creator and supreme deity and would sometimes appeal directly\nto him rather than to their partner deities.\nWho were the associate gods worshipped besides Allāh? They are almost never iden-\ntified, which is likely to be a deliberate device (cf. Chabbi 2020, 54). Two exceptions are\nQ 53:19–20 and 71:23. The former passage lists three goddesses who according to extra-\nQur’anic sources had designated sanctuaries in the wider region around Mecca, namely,\nAllāt (worshipped at al- Ṭāʾif by the tribe of Thaqīf, among others), al- ʿUzzā (whom the\nQuraysh worshipped at a tree sanctuary at Nakhlah, between Mecca and al- Ṭāʾif), and\nManāt (worshipped at Qudayd between Mecca and Medina, inter alia by the Medinan\ntribes of Aws and Khazraj). Literary and epigraphic sources show that Allāt in par tic u lar\nwas venerated well beyond the Ḥijāz, for instance, by the Nabataeans or the authors of the\nSafaitic inscriptions (RAH 24–45; Krone 1992; Ammann 2001, 21; Dost 2017, 27–44). A\nsecond Qur’anic passage containing names of pagan deities, Q 71:23, enumerates a number\nof gods allegedly venerated by the people of Noah. They include the South Arabian deity\nWadd and should prob ably also be considered “local Arabian deities” who are retrojected\nto the time of Noah (Dost 2017, 44–50; see also RAH 13–24; for some references to Wadd/\nWudd in pre- Islamic Arabic poetry, see Sinai 2019b, 19, 23, and 54–55). In sum, the Qur’an\nofers at least limited evidence that the beings revered by its associating opponents were\npagan— i.e., non- Jewish and non- Christian— Arabian and Near Eastern deities. To the\ntwo passages just discussed one might add two o thers providing indirect evidence that\nthe worship of celestial bodies was not unknown in the Qur’anic milieu (QP 56): Q 41:37\nwarns against prostrating oneself before the sun and the moon (cf. Deut 4:19), and Q 27:24\n11 The mean verse length of Surah 30 is 87.2 transliteration letters.\n12 However, there are also cases in which “instead of God” is the more appropriate rendering of min dūn\nallāh, such as Q 4:119 and 18:50 (Ambros 2001, 11).\n430 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Some form of astral worship may also\nform the background to Q 53:49, which declares that God is “the Lord of Sirius” (rabb\nal- shiʿrā), perhaps by way of rejecting worship of the star itself.13\nWhile the Qur’an contains only scant data allowing us to glimpse the identity of the\nassociators’ deities in terms that would have been employed by Muhammad’s opponents\nthemselves, the Islamic scripture intimates quite frequently how the social fact of poly-\ntheistic worship is to be construed from a Qur’anic vantage point. As Crone points out\n(QP 72–77), we are in fact confronted with more than one such account (though these\nexplanations are not necessarily incompatible, in so far as dif er ent construals could\nbe applied to dif er ent cults). One approach, which one might have expected to be the\ndominant one, is simply to dismiss the associators’ false deities as non- existent figments\nof the human imagination. This is, however, relatively infrequent: three verses call the\nfalse deities mere “names that youp have devised, you and your forefathers” (Q 7:71, 12:40,\n53:23: asmāʾ sammaytumūhā antum wa- ābāʾukum), and Q 40:74 predicts that the associ-\nators will eventually, at the last judgement, admit that what they used to call upon was in\nfact nothing (bal lam nakun nadʿū min qablu shayʾan; see QP 75).14 More commonly, the\nQur’an does not deny that the beings whom the associators regard as deities do in fact exist\nand only takes issue with the divine status imputed to them (Welch 1979, 738; Hawting\n1999, 51). This is obvious, for instance, in Q 25:3 (discussed in Welch 1979, 738), where it is\nsaid that the deities who are worshipped besides God “create nothing and are themselves\ncreated.” The declaration that the associators’ objects of worship are themselves “created”\nrecurs in Q 7:191 and 16:20, in the former case followed by the statement, in 7:194, that\n“ those whom youp call upon besides God are servants [of him] like you” (inna lladhīna\ntadʿūna min dūni llāhi ʿibādun amthālukum).15 What the associators worship, then, is not\nsimply nothing; rather, what they worship are other rational agents, that is, beings who\nwill face divine judgement just like their devotees.\nThat the false deities exist, albeit not qua deities, is entailed with par tic u lar clarity\nby a number of passages depicting how the associators w ill, again on the occasion of the\neschatological judgement, be brought face to face with the “associates” (shurakāʾ) they\nused to worship, who are portrayed as disowning their erstwhile votaries and as failing\nto respond to their appeals for help (Q 10:28–29, 16:86–87, 18:52, 19:81–82, 28:62–64,\n30:13, 35:14, 46:5–6; cf. also 6:22.94, 16:27, 37:22–23, 41:47–48; see on this material Welch\n13 Cf. also the scene in Q 6:76–79, where Abraham briefly pays homage to a star, the moon, and the sun.\nAnother potentially relevant verse is Q 37:125, where Elijah (ilyās) asks his people, “Do you call upon Baal?” In\nview of an inscription in mixed Safaitic-H ismaic script that may contain echoes of the myth of Baal (Al- Jallad\n2015b), it is conceivable, therefore, that Q 37:125, like 71:23, could tell us something about the deities venerated\nin the Qur’anic milieu, despite being set in the past. I owe this point to Saqib Hussain.\n14 Crone also references Q 37:86 and 46:28, which denounce the associators’ belief in other deities as a lie\n(ifk), but this is less unequivocal (cf. the use of ifk in Q 37:151). The lie involved might simply consist in untruth-\nfully identifying certain beings as deities rather than in untruthfully positing the existence of beings that do not\nexist in the first place.\n15 On the meaning of min dūn allāh h ere, see Ambros 2001, 12–13 (inclining marginally t owards “instead of”).\nAs Crone notes (QP 73–74), Q 7:191 occurs in connection with language that is reminiscent of Biblical polemics\nagainst idols as impotent human artefacts (cf. Q 7:195 and Ps 115:4–8, 135:15–18, for which Crone credits Joseph\nWitztum). However, to say that the false deities are “servants” of God (Q 7:194) or that they will be resurrected\n(Q 16:21) clearly presupposes that they are more than just artefacts. As Crone puts it, the Qur’an is h ere “using the\nold language of polemics against idolatry in a situation in which physical idols are no longer the issue” (QP 74).\nashraka 431", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

An in ter est ing variant of this motif is found in Q 34:40–41: on the day\non which God will assem ble every one for judgement, God will ask the angels whether\nit is they whom those destined for damnation used to worshipped; the angels, however,\nwill protest that the real objects of the unbelievers’ veneration w ere the jinn or demons\n(on which see under → jinn). A similar dialogue between God and the angels is staged\nin Q 25:17–18.16 That the Qur’an is identifying the real objects of the associators’ rituals\nwith the jinn also emerges from other verses, such as Q 6:100, 37:158, and 72:6 (see again\nunder → jinn). Moreover, it tallies well with Q 21:98–99 and 37:22–23. In both of these\npassages, the wrongdoers are dispatched to hell together with “that which they used to\nserve” (Q 37:22: mā kānū yaʿbudūn; 21:98: mā taʿbudūna min dūni llāhi); the point being\nmade is surely not that it is the angels who will be sentenced to damnation. In addition,\nthe Qur’an sometimes reveals a certain presumption that the recipients of illicit polythe-\nistic worship are likely to have been complicit in the veneration accorded to them. Thus,\nQ 25:17 has God interrogate the angels w hether they bear responsibility for having misled\npolytheistic worshippers (a-a ntum aḍlaltum ʿibādī hāʾulāʾi am hum ḍallū l-s abīlā). This\npresumption of complicity fits the jinn—w ho like h umans can be right eous or wayward\n(see under → jinn)— much better than angels, whom the Qur’an considers to be invari-\nably obedient to God (see under → malak). The upshot, in any case, is that the Qur’an is\nconstruing the associators’ rituals not as targeting, as it were, pure nothingness but rather\nas addressing beings who are real but do not deserve veneration. As Hawting aptly notes,\nsuch an account of polytheistic rituals has Biblical prec e dent (Hawting 1999, 51): “what\npagans sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons” (1 Cor 10:20; cf. Deut 32:17).\nOther passages, though, give the impression that the objects of the associators’ worship\nare not jinn but rather angels (QP 74). Thus, Q 43:19 complains that the opponents “turn\nthe angels, who are servants of the Merciful, into females,” while 53:27 protests that “ those\nwho do not believe in the hereafter call the angels by female names (la- yusammūna\nl-malāʾikata tasmiyata l-u nthā).” The charge of worshipping female angels, belief in whom is\nalso denounced in Q 17:40 and 37:149–153, fits the fact that, judging by Q 53:19–20, at least\nsome of the associators’ deities— Allāt, al- ʿUzzā, and Manāt— were female. Yet why would\nthe Qur’an equate the associators’ goddesses with angels, though angels misconstrued as\nfemales, or at least entertain such an equation? Most likely, the concept of angels entered\ninto the debate about what, if anything, the associators were r eally worshipping b ecause it\nwas the associators themselves who cast their female deities as angels (against Welch 1979,\n740; see also the discussion under → malak). In fact, the supposition that the associators\nconceptualised their female deities as angels cogently accounts for three dif er ent types\nof Qur’anic statements: it explains why the Qur’an finds it necessary to maintain that the\nassociators’ rituals are directed at non-a ngelic, demonic beings (e.g., Q 6:100) rather than\nat real angels, who are presumably not female (Q 34:40–41); it explains why Q 25:17–18\nraise, and rule out, the possibility that the angels might have encouraged the worship\nthey receive; and it explains why the Qur’an repeatedly accuses the associators of having\na faulty— specifically, a misgendered— conception of the nature of angels (e.g., Q 43:19).\n16 God’s interlocutors are not explic itly identified as angels in Q 25:17–18, but the wording of the interloc-\nutors’ response in Q 25:18 (qālū subḥānaka mā kāna yanbaghī lanā an nattakhidha min dūnika min awliyāʾa) is\nsufficiently similar to 34:41 (qālū subḥānaka anta waliyyunā min dūnihim) in order to warrant identifying them\nwith the angels mentioned in 34:40.\n432 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Despite the trenchancy of the\nQur’an’s polemical attacks on the associators, it is crucial to appreciate that the theological\nviews attributed to them agree with Qur’anic doctrine in one impor tant re spect: as noted\nabove and observed already by Muḥammad Ibn ʿAbd al- Wahhāb (Hawting 1999, 81–82), the\nassociators w ere by no means opposed to recognising Allāh as a supreme deity. Thus, several\nverses formulaically assert that the Messenger’s antagonists believed God to be the creator\nof the world: “If you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they w ill say, ‘God’ ”\n(Q 31:25 and 39:38: wa- la-in saʾaltahum man khalaqa l-s amāwāti wa- l- arḍa la- yaqūlunna\nllāhu; see similarly 29:61 and 43:9). In a similar manner, the Messenger’s adversaries are\ndepicted as conceding that God has created h umans (Q 43:87), that he “made the sun and\nthe moon subservient” (Q 29:61), that he “sends down rain from the sky” (Q 29:63), and\nthat he reigns over the earth and the heavens and exercises kingly dominion (malakūt) over\nevery thing (Q 23:84–89). In view of such verses, the Qur’anic associators do not seem to\nhave considered the partner deities venerated by them to have been involved in the creation\nof the cosmos (QP 59–61), even if Q 7:190 accuses the Qur’anic opponents of crediting their\nassociate deities with bestowing c hildren. Thus, when verses like Q 13:16 ask, “Have they\nassigned associates to God who have created as he has created?” (am jaʿalū li- llāhi shurakāʾa\nkhalaqū ka- khalqihi; see also Q 10:34, 35:40, 46:4), the point is prob ably not that the oppo-\nnents maintain that t here are co- creators with Allāh; rather, the Qur’an is arguing that if t here\nwere any other deities besides Allāh, they would thereby need to be considered co- creators,\na conclusion assumed to be absurd even from the associators’ own perspective.17\nIn a handful of passages, the Qur’an condemns those who “assign equals to God” (jaʿala\nli- llāhi andādan; see Q 2:22, 14:30, 34:33, 39:8, 41:9; cf. also 2:165: man yattakhidhu min\ndūni llāhi andādan). The nidd of someone or something is commonly said to be his or\nits “like” (e.g., AEL 2778), and translators tend to render the plural andād as “equals” or\n“rivals.” This may generate the impression that the Qur’anic verses just referenced are con-\ntending with opponents who recognised a plurality of deities who w ere credited with the\nsame rank and authority as Allāh. However, closer analy sis reveals that the phrase jaʿala\nli- llāhi andādan should not be pressed to yield insight into the structure of the associators’\npantheon. For the Qur’an other wise supplies fairly unequivocal evidence that the associ-\nators considered their partner deities to rank below Allāh. Thus, apart from the fact that\nAllāh’s status as the world’s creator appears to have gone unchallenged, some opponents\nare taken to task for ascribing “ofspring” (walad) or daughters to Allāh (e.g., Q 16:57,\n21:26, 43:16; see QP 57).18 Whether or not this involved any literal notion of genealogical\ndescent, to call certain deities “ daughters of Allāh” would have been a way of casting them\nas divine yet inferior to Allāh (RAH 24; HCI 68). Moreover, we saw above that the Qur’anic\nadversaries are presented as positing and venerating female angels, which also points to\na theology of subordination. It stands to reason that such talk of Allāh’s daughters and of\nfemale angels primarily intended the pagan goddesses Allāt, al-ʿ Uzzā, and Manāt, whose\nnames we encountered in Q 53:19–22.19 Likewise suggestive of subordination are verses\n17 As Crone puts it, the Qur’anic Messenger is here “confronting his opponents with the (to him) absurd\nimplications of their own beliefs,” since to him “absence of creative powers implied absence of divinity” (QP 60).\n18 The claim that God has no ofspring (walad) can also be directed against the Christians. This seems\nclearest in Q 4:171 and 19:35.\n19 Bowersock holds that t here is no reason to assume that Allāt, al-ʿ Uzzā, and Manāt w ere seen as Allāh’s\ndaughters (Bowersock 2013, 99).

They are, for instance, portrayed as seeking Allāh’s\nassistance on sea voyages and in situations of distress (Q 6:63–64, 10:22–23, 17:67–69,\n29:65, 31:32; see QP 62–63).21 God was also asked to grant healthy children (Q 7:189–190).\nSacrifices of agricultural produce and of livestock w ere divided up between Allāh and the\npartner deities imputed to him (Q 6:136), which means that to the associators Allāh was\nby no means a deus otiosus, or a high god who is not an object of direct worship (QP 80;\nsee also Sinai 2019b, 30 and 51–52). Given Allāh’s status as a creator, the intermediary and\nsubordinate position of other deities, Allāh’s ability to intervene directly in the world, and\nthe possibility of appealing directly to Allāh rather than g oing through subordinate gods,\nit is not indefensible to characterise the Qur’anic associators too as espousing a type of\nmono the ism (e.g., QP 63, 77), though their understanding of the divine exhibits crucial\ndiferences from the Qur’anic one: “the [Qur’anic] Messenger saw a stark contrast between\nGod and every thing else whereas the pagans saw divinity as a spectrum” (QP 61; see also\nunder → allāh).\nThe associators’ denial of and/or lack of concern with the resurrection. Apart\nfrom the associators’ graded conception of the divine, which the Qur’anic proclamations\nonly begin to reject in an explicit fashion from the end of the early Meccan period on-\nwards, the Qur’an’s doctrinal disagreement with the associators centres on two further\nissues. The first one is the Meccan opponents’ rejection of the Qur’anic Messenger’s claim\nto convey divine revelations (e.g., Q 10:2; see HCI 177). The second one, which requires\nmore detailed discussion, is the opponents’ denial of an eschatological resurrection and\ndivine judgement (QP 125–182). According to a number of passages, Muhammad’s Meccan\ndata that is available for t hese three goddesses. However, the notion is implied rather unequivocally by Q 53:21–22\n(thus also QP 56, dismissed without a convincing argument in Bowersock 2013, 100). I have elsewhere conjec-\ntured that an explicit subordination of Allāt, al- ʿUzzā, and Manāt to Allāh was likely a local Meccan development,\nserving to uphold the primacy of the Meccan sanctuary and its patron deity Allāh over other gods and associated\ncultic sites (HCI 69–70 and Sinai 2019b, 56; see also the following section of the entry). For an assertion of\nAllāh’s supremacy over Allāt and al- ʿUzzā in a poem attributed to Aws ibn Ḥajar, see Geyer 1892, no. 11:2 (briefly\ndiscussed in Sinai 2019b, 55). This poetic prooftext is admittedly isolated and therefore not above suspicion.\n20 Although vario us Qur’anic passages address the question of intercession with God in the context of the\neschatological judgement (e.g., Q 43:86), this does not show that the associators considered the intercessory\npowers they attributed to their subordinate deities to be eschatological, seeing that they did not accept the notion\nof a resurrection and eschatological judgement (see below). See also Q 36:23, which makes clear that the general\nissue at stake is that the intercession of any alleged deities other than or besides God will be of no avail “if the\nMerciful intends something harmful for me” (in yuridni l- raḥmānu bi-ḍ urrin).\n21 This has been described as “temporary mono thei sm” (GMK 102), but this notion is convincingly critiqued\nby Crone (QP 63).\n434 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 16:38 complains that “they”—p resumably linking back\nto the explicit reference to “the associators” (alladhīna ashrakū) in v. 35— “swear by God\ntheir strongest oaths that God does not resurrect someone who dies” (wa-a qsamū bi-\nllāhi jahda aymānihim lā yabʿathu llāhu man yamūtu). The Meccan opponents are also\nfrequently and formulaically quoted as posing the rhetorical question whether they are\ngoing to be re created or raised from the dead after having become “earth” or “bones and\nfragments,” the thrust being clearly that such a scenario involves manifest absurdity (e.g.,\nQ 13:5: a-i dhā kunnā turāban a-i nnā la-f ī khalqin jadīdin, and 17:49.98: a-i dhā kunnā\nʿiẓāman wa-r ufātan a-i nnā la-m abʿūthūna khalqan jadīdā).22 The Meccan surahs, one\ngathers, w ere faced with a wall of eschatological doubt, and indeed from very early on\nthe Qur’anic proclamations attack t hose guilty of “dismissing the judgement as a lie” (e.g.,\nQ 82:9, 83:10–12; → kadhdhaba). The cause for this dispute was not, it must be under-\nlined, that the associators w ere unfamiliar with the notion of an eschatological judgement,\nfor Muhammad’s opponents frequently dismiss this idea as “ancient scribblings” (e.g.,\nQ 23:82–83, 27:67–68; → ˻asāṭīr al-a wwalīn) and as something that “has been pledged\nto us and our forefathers before” (Q 23:83, 27:68; see also HCI 164–165). Parenthetically,\nthe associators’ denial of an eschatological resurrection does not preclude that they may\nhave accepted that the spirit of a deceased human was capable of a spectre- like afterlife\nand might, for instance, continue to haunt his grave in the form of an owl crying out to be\navenged. This belief, which is well attested in pre-I slamic poetry (Homerin 1985), should\nnot be conflated with the Judaeo- Christian idea of a universal resurrection of the dead at\nthe end of history and a subsequent moral judgement by God, leading to reward in paradise\nand punishment in hell.\nThat denial of the resurrection was a universal characteristic of the Qur’anic opponents\nhas been questioned by Crone, who maintains that “t here w ere infidels who believed in the\nday of judgement without paying much attention to it” (QP 125–126). Her weightiest piece\nof evidence is Q 70:6–7: “They see it as something distant; // we see it as something near”\n(innahum yarawnahu baʿīdā // wa- narāhu qarībā). Qarīb must certainly mean “temporally\nnear” here, in line with quite a few other verses (e.g., Q 21:1.97.109, 33:63, 42:17, 54:1,\n72:25, 78:40; see also under → sāʿah), and Q 21:109 clearly opposes qarīb and baʿīd in the\nsense of “temporally near” and “temporally distant.”23 This would support taking baʿīd to\nmean “temporally distant” in Q 70:6 as well. On the other hand, in Q 50:3, a parallel also\nacknowledged by Crone, baʿīd is best understood construed to mean “far- fetched,” “im-\nprobable,” or “implausible.” Here, the Qur’anic adversaries declare, “When we have died\nand become earth— that would be a far- fetched return!” (a- idhā mitnā wa- kunnā turāban\ndhālika rajʿun baʿīd). The statement is elliptical, in so far as it omits the sceptical question\n“ Shall we be resurrected?” (a- innā la- mabʿūthūna) that follows the temporal clause intro-\nduced by a- idhā in many other verses. In view of the relevant parallels, the speakers in\nQ 50:3 must be deniers of the resurrection rather than merely proponents of the view that\nthe resurrection was perfectly real but simply a long way of. In light of Q 50:3, therefore,\n70:6 is best taken to mean, “They see it as something far-f etched” rather than “as something\n22 See also Q 23:35.82, 27:67, 37:16.53, 50:3 (discussed further below), and 56:47.\n23 On baʿīd, see CDKA 41.\nashraka 435", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Accordingly, one ought to\nresist the temptation to press the Qur’anic wording for univocality h ere and instead accept\nthat baʿīd in Q 70:6 blends connotations of temporal distance and improbability.\nIt is in any case not likely that denial of the resurrection had a downright credal status\nfor the Qur’anic opponents. More prob ably, the adversaries occupied dif er ent positions\nalong a spectrum or sliding scale shading from resolute denial of the resurrection into\ngrave doubts about it into an agnostic lack of concern with it. The latter end of this spec-\ntrum would seem to be documented by Q 18:36 and 41:50 (see QP 126). These two verses\ndepict unbelievers who declare that they “do not consider the hour [of resurrection] to be\ncoming” (mā aẓunnu l- sāʿata qāʾimatan) but then go on to profess that if they are ever re-\nturned to their Lord (wa- la-in rudidtu ilā rabbī / wa- la-in rujiʿtu ilā rabbī) they expect only\ngood to come of it. A similar position might be deemed to be reflected in the accusation\nthat Muhammad’s opponents are oblivious and unmindful (gh- f- l) of the world to come:\n“they are heedless of the hereafter” (Q 30:7: wa- hum ʿani l-ā khirati hum ghāfilūn; see also\nQ 19:39, 21:1.97, and 50:22, which have fī ghaflatin, “in a state of heedlessness”).24 But it\nmay also be that Qur’anic polemic is sometimes conflating the view that the resurrection\nis unproven or improbable, on the one hand, with a lack of due concern with it, on the\nother—t hat is, with a morally culpable unwillingness to recognise what is assumed to be\nan undeniable fact for anyone prepared to consider the m atter rationally and without bias.\nThus, from the perspective of the Qur’anic conviction that the resurrection is a certainty,\n“dismissing” it “as a lie” (→ kadhdhaba) will not primarily have appeared as an erroneous\nbelief but rather as tantamount to wilfully “turning one’s back” (tawallā) on an indubitable\nreal ity (Q 92:16, 96:13; see HCI 164). But even an attitude of eschatological heedlessness\nthat is not accompanied by an explicit dismissal of the judgement’s real ity would not be\nproperly describable as belief in the resurrection. This makes Crone’s formulation that\nsome associators “believed in the day of judgement without paying much attention to it”\nprone to misunderstanding.\nThe associators and the idea of revelation. A final aspect of the associators’ profile\nof beliefs is their stance towards the concept of divine revelation. This is not entirely\nstraightforward to ascertain. For starters, Muhammad’s pagan adversaries seem to have\nheld certain entrenched preconceptions about divine revelation, especially the view that\ngenuine revelations would have to be relayed by an angel (→ malak) capable of working\nmiracles rather than by an ordinary human like Muhammad, “who eats food and walks\nabout in the marketplaces” (Q 25:7; for a detailed study, refer to QP 102–124).25 Moreover,\nthe associators are depicted as asessing Muhammad’s claim to convey divine warnings\nagainst the track rec ord of earlier prophetic figures. Thus, Q 6:124 complains, “And when\na sign comes to them, they say, ‘We shall not believe until we are given the same as what\n24 Charges of heedlessness are also uttered with regard to other objects, such as God’s signs (Q 7:136.146,\n10:7.92).\n25 For dif er ent manifestations of this premise (though in some cases partial ones or statements made about\nthe audience of past messengers), see Q 6:8–9.111, 11:12.27, 17:94–95, 21:7–8, 23:24.33–34, 25:20–21, 36:15, 41:14,\n54:24.\n436 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 6:124 moreover\nmakes it explicit that such a confirmatory miracle would have to mea sure up to the miracles\nattributed to e arlier messengers: whenever the Qur’anic audience is given a “sign” (āyah),\nthey declare that they w ill not believe “u ntil we are given what God’s [previous] messengers\nwere given” (ḥattā nuʾtā mithla mā ūtiya rusulu llāhi; see also Q 21:5). Specifically, Muham-\nmad is challenged to replicate the achievements of Moses (Q 28:48: law- lā ūtiya mithla mā\nūtiya mūsā, “why was he”— i.e., Muhammad— “not given the like of what Moses was given?”).\nThe Qur’anic opponents seem to deploy Moses as a benchmark of what a credible claimant\nto prophecy o ught to look like. Hence, as Crone notes, the Qur’anic pagans appear to have\n“accepted Moses as a prophet” and to have regarded him as “paradigmatic” (QP 112–113, citing\n112)—or at least to have accepted him as a prophet for the sake of argument, in the interest\nof discrediting the Qur’anic Messenger as failing to mea sure up to him.\nThe material just surveyed could suggest that Muhammad’s associating adversaries\nacknowledged the general possibility of divine revelation as long as such revelations w ere\nmediated by angels. According to Q 6:91, the Qur’anic opponents maintain that “God has\nnot sent anything down on a human” (mā anzala llāhu ʿalā basharin min shayʾin; cf. the\nparallel phraseology in Q 36:15 and 67:9: mā anzala/nazzala l- raḥmānu/llāhu min shayʾin).\nIn line with the proposal just made, this does not need to be read as a categorical denial of\nany sort of revelatory communication from God; rather, if one puts the stress on “ human,”\nthe statement might simply express the assumption that only angels are worthy to be direct\nrecipients of divine revelation. Alternatively, one might stress “send down” and interpret\nQ 6:91 to manifest the belief that h uman prophets would have to ascend to heaven rather\nthan receiving revelations descending from above (QP 119–123; on prophetic ascent to\nheaven, see also u nder → nazzala). Either reading would be compatible with the under-\nstanding that the associators were genuinely committed to the idea of divine revelation\nand that their disagreement with the Qur’anic proclamations only concerned modalities.\nUltimately, though, it seems unlikely that the associators endorsed the idea of divine reve-\nlation, w hether it be revelation mediated by angels or revelation mediated through prophetic\nascent. The associators certainly do not seem to have claimed to be in possession of revela-\ntions themselves: many Qur’anic passages presuppose quite unequivocally that Muhammad’s\nassociating opponents had not previously received from God “scriptures to study” (Q 34:44:\nwa- mā ātaynāhum min kutubin yadrusūnahā; see also 35:40, 37:156–157, 43:21, 46:4, 54:43,\nand 68:37).26 This is so despite the fact that the Qur’an takes the associators to task for ignor-\ning “the clear proof that is contained in the ancient writings” (Q 20:133: a- wa- lam taʾtihim\nbayyinatu mā fī l-ṣ uḥufi l-ū lā). Crone considers this to presuppose that “ancient books with\nprobative value were already in circulation, presumably among the polytheists themselves”\n(QP 146), but this paraphrase is problematic. Undoubtedly, the Qur’anic addressees must\nhave been familiar with the concept of revealed scripture and must have had sufficient ex-\nposure to Christ iani ty and Judaism in order to render intelligible the Qur’anic view that they\nhad had ample opportunity to let themselves be persuaded by certain foundational tenets\n26 See also Q 29:48, stating that the Qur’anic Messenger did not have access to a scripture prior to the\nQur’anic revelations.

But this does not mean that the associators must have\ndeemed the scriptural and parascriptural texts in which t hese doctrines w ere contained, or\nassumed to be contained, to be part of their own cultural patrimony or that they w ere wont\nto consult and invoke such texts in regular and detailed interpretive fashion. While Crone\nargues that Q 6:91 (part of which was quoted above) shows that the associators recognised\nand transmitted the “scripture brought by Moses” (QP 110–114), her understanding of the\nverse is questionable, as shown in the excursus below.27\nIn general, therefore, it would seem that when Muhammad’s opponents protest against\nnon- angelic messengers or demand Mosaic signs, they are making dialectical moves in\norder to discredit Qur’anic prophetology and cannot be assumed to express their own\npositive beliefs.28 The associators, in other words, w ere sufficiently familiar with Biblically\nbased notions of divine revelation in order to exploit this knowledge to the end of casting\ndoubt on the par tic u lar way in which the Qur’an understands the pro cess of divine revela-\ntion (namely, as something that God “sends down” upon select mortals; → nazzala); but\nthe Qur’anic associators do not seem to have relied on the quotation and interpretation of\nany specific textual corpus in defense of their own doctrines and practices. Instead, what\nthey are routinely portrayed as adducing in support of their veneration of other deities is\nancestral tradition, “that to which we have found our forefathers (singular: → ab) beholden\nand accustomed” (e.g., Q 31:21: mā wajadnā ʿalayhi ābāʾanā; see also the contrast between\nscriptural and ancestral authority in 43:21–22).\nThe associators as syncretistic pagans. Considering what has been said so far, it seems\nlikely that the Qur’anic associators w ere pagans (i.e., persons who did not formally profess\nand habitually practise some form of Judaism or Christ ian ity) of a syncretistic bent who\ndid not hesitate to appropriate a certain number of notions that were also a staple of Jew-\nish and Christian discourse, such as the concept of angels (→ malak). Another example is\nthe associators’ apparent reliance on the idea of intercession with a supreme deity (HCI\n69–72).29 It is moreover quite conceivable that the associators’ cultic practices, too, inte-\ngrated ele ments of Jewish and Christian ritual (→ ṣallā). Yet, as intimated above, none of\nthis warrants the conclusion that the associators are a mere cipher for Jews or Christians,\nsince Medinan verses squarely juxtapose the associators with Jews and Christians (Q 5:82,\n22:17) or with the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb), the Qur’anic umbrella term for\nJews and Christians (Q 2:105, 3:186, 98:1.6). This presupposes that the Qur’an is envisaging\nall of t hese entities as dif er ent collectives. While the prooftexts just adduced are relatively\nlate, there is nothing in the Meccan surahs to suggest that Muhammad’s associating antag-\nonists hail from Jewish or Christian ranks.\n27 Crone does, however, show quite compellingly that the way in which the associators expressed themselves\naccording to the Qur’an exhibits traces of Biblical diction (QP 139–149). This meshes with the idea, advocated\nin the next section of the main text, that the Qur’anic associators, though worshipping traditional pagan deities,\nwere prepared to adopt certain elem ents of the Biblical tradition. But it does not require the associators to have\nbeen avid readers and interpreters of scriptural and parascriptural texts.\n28 This possibility is duly set out and considered, though ultimately dismissed, in QP 112.\n29 This is so even though intercession among humans figures in early Arabic poetry and must accordingly\nhave been a known aspect of social interaction in Arabian tribal socie ties and of the ways in which one might\nrelate to rulers and patrons (Riad 1981, 39–44). However, Riad 1981, 53, thinks that the religious employment\nof intercession was “calqued on the profane use of the word.” This implicitly contradicts my conjecture that the\nassociators’ ideas about intercession with the supreme deity adopt a Jewish or Christian motif.\n438 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This shows that the beliefs the Qur’an attributes to the associ-\nators could indeed have been held by Arabian pagans. The fit with poetry is not complete,\nthough, since the poetic corpus contains almost no traces of the Qur’anic associators’ well-\narticulated theology of subordination, which classed deities other than Allāh as his ofspring,\nas angels, or as playing a mediating role (Sinai 2019b, 55–56, citing one exception). This\ncan be explained by the assumption that the associators’ theology of subordination was a\nspecifically Meccan development, possibly a relatively recent one, whose key objective was\nto buttress the superiority of the Meccan sanctuary over regional competitors, such as the\nsanctuary of Allāt at al- Ṭāʾif (HCI 69–70; Sinai 2019b, 56).\nThe root sh- r- k in poetry and Epigraphic South Arabian. Does the Qur’an’s distinctive\nusage of derivatives of sh-r -k in the context of religious polemics have a background in\nearlier discourses? Ancient Arabic poetry afords no hitherto identified pre ce dent (Zay-\ntūnī 1987, 204; Hawting 1999, 70), although this is hardly astonishing given that the bulk\nof pre- Qur’anic poetry is not, like the Qur’an, committed to a Biblically based insistence\non God’s oneness. Where derivatives of sh- r- k do occur in pre-I slamic verse, they have a\ngeneric, non-t heological sense (e.g., DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 20:21), which is occasionally also\nthe case in the Qur’an: Q 4:12 refers to the b rothers and s isters of a deceased as “sharing\nin” (fa-h um shurakāʾu fī) a third of the estate; 20:32 reports Moses’s demand that God\nmake his brother Aaron share in his prophetic task (wa- ashrikhu fī amrī); and a parable in\nQ 39:29 speaks of a “man,” presumably a slave, who is the property of “partners who dis-\nagree” or “quarrelling sharers” (shurakāʾ mutashākisūn). A more pertinent antecedent than\npoetry is a fragmentary South Arabian inscription that has been construed as employing\nthe noun s2- r- k in a sense equivalent to Qur’anic shirk (Mordtmann and Müller 1896, 287\nand 290–291; CIH, no. 539, l. 3; see also KU 61; Ahrens 1935, 46–48; FVQ 186). The text\nis however difficult to translate with certainty. Other Sabaic inscriptions show that the\nroot s2-r -k , used both verbally and as a noun, has the same basic meaning of sharing and\nassociation as Arabic sh- r- k (Beeston et al. 1982, 134; Hawting 1999, 70; see also Hayajneh\n2011, 140).30 A specialised religious usage of Sabaic s2- r- k would therefore be conceivable.\nYet in the absence of further attestations, a proximate origin of the Qur’anic notion of\ntheological “association” in South Arabia remains uncertain (Hawting 1999, 69–70).\nQur’anic ashraka and rabbinic shittēp. Whether or not the Qur’anic use of ashraka and\nshirk has Sabaic pre ced ent, the ultimate source of the concept is likely Jewish. This is histor-\nically plausible in so far as the Ḥimyarite turn to mono thei sm was informed by a deliberate\nappeal to the people of Israel and to Jewish terms and concepts (see, e.g., Gajda 2009).\nSpecifically, as noted by Horovitz (KU 61), rabbinic texts employ the Hebrew verb shittēp\n(Aramaic shattēp or shawtēp) to denote the “association” or “joining” of another being\nwith God (see DTTM 1639; DJBA 1186), allowing Uri Rubin’s modern Hebrew translation\nof the Qur’an to render alladhīna ashrakū and al- mushrikūn as ha- mǝshattēpim throughout\n(Rubin 2016). Just like Arabic sh- r- k, the Hebrew and Aramaic root sh- t- p occurs not only as\na verb (shittēp, shattēp, ashraka) but also as a noun, with Arabic sharīk, “associate, partner,”\ncorresponding to Hebrew shuttap (see DTTM 1544) and Aramaic shuttapa (DJBA 1126).\n30 I am however doubtful about Hayajneh’s proposal, based on the South Arabian material adduced by him,\nthat the word shurakāʾ in Q 6:136 should be translated as “(crop-)sharers.”\nashraka 439", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Bәr. 59b), some of their rabbinic occurrences\nare highly germane to the Qur’an’s prevalent use of ashraka and shirk in relation to God’s\noneness and his exclusive entitlement to religious worship.\nMost striking are two passages in the Babylonian Talmud citing an extra- Mishnaic\ntannaitic tradition to the efect that “whoever joins (or associates; mǝshattēp) the heavenly\nname with something else shall be uprooted from the world” (b. Sanh. 63a and b. Sukkah\n45b). This claim is then scripturally anchored in Exod 22:19 (“Whoever sacrifices to any\ngod, other than the Lord alone, shall be devoted to destruction”). Here, “associating” God\nwith other beings operates as a label for violating God’s exclusive entitlement to cultic\nveneration, just as the Qur’anic associators are castigated for including subordinate deities\nin their worship. Also relevant is a denial articulated in Genesis Rabbah, via a midrash on\nIsa 44:24, that any of the angels might have been God’s “associates” in creation (Gen. Rab.\n1:3 and 3:8; see Fossum 1985a, 225–226). A similar impetus inheres in a tradition preserved\nboth in the Babylonian Talmud and in the Tosefta, according to which Adam was the last\nbeing created by God “so that the heretics might not say that the Holy One, blessed be\nhe, had an associate in the work of creation” (b. Sanh. 38a; with a variant wording, though\nincluding the term shuttap, t. Sanh. 8:7; see Segal 2002, 111–112). As we saw above, the\nQur’an is similarly explicit that God does not have “associates” (shurakāʾ) “who have cre-\nated as he has created” (khalaqū ka- khalqihi; Q 13:16). Hence, the link between Qur’anic\nsh- r- k and the theme of creation, and more generally the notion that God’s uniqueness\nand lack of any associates is manifested by his exclusive power of creation, is one that is\nanticipated by rabbinic material—t hough one might add that denials of the notion that God\nhad a “partner” or “associate” in creation also occur in Samaritan lit er a ture (Macdonald\n1963, 1:48 and 2:78 = Memar Marqah 2:10, corresponding to Ben- Ḥayyim 1988, 150 and\n151 = fol. 100b).31 All of this has the significant consequence that the impression emerging\nfrom certain Meccan passages, such as Q 46:10, that the Qur’anic community interacted\nwith “Israelites” (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl) is confirmed by a core aspect of Qur’anic theology, the\npolemic against associationism.\nHowever, rabbinic references to the “association” of God’s name with something other\nthan God or to the notion that God might have “associates” are not invariably negative.\nThus, the Jerusalem Talmud states that “the Holy One, blessed be he, associated his g reat\nname with Israel” (y. Taʿan. 2:6, 65d = ed. and trans. Guggenheimer, 72), alluding to the\ntheophoric etymology of the name yiśrā-ʾ ēl (Gen 32:29: “for you have striven, śārîtā, with\nGod and with h umans”). In the treatment of Exod 18:13 (according to which Moses judged\nthe Israelites “from the morning unto the even ing”) in the Mәkilta dә- Rabbi Yishmaʿēl, it is\nclaimed that the similarity between Exod 18:13 (Moses “sat as judge for the p eople, while the\npeople stood around him from morning u ntil even ing”) and Gen 1:5 (“God called the light\nday, and the darkness he called night; and t here was even ing and t here was morning, the\nfirst day”) demonstrates that somebody who “renders a true judgement is considered as if he\nhad been an associate of the Holy One, blessed be he, in the work of creation” (Lauterbach\n2004, 2:281; see also the parallels in b. Shabb. 10a and in the Mәkilta dә- Rabbi Shimʿon bar\n31 I owe my awareness of Samaritan parallels to Fossum 1985a, 224–227, who cites Macdonald 1963, 1:97 and\n2:161 = Memar Marqah 4:7, and Macdonald 1963, 1:131 and 2:213 = Memar Marqah 6:1. However, books 3–6 of\nMemar Marqah / Tibat Marqe were composed at some point between the sixth and tenth centuries CE, making\na pre- Qur’anic date uncertain (Ben- Ḥayyim 1988, v; see also the relevant section of Hjelm 2016).\n440 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Genesis Rabbah reports how God told Abraham that he would\nhenceforth regard him “as though you w ere associated with me in the creation of the world,”\ndue to Abraham’s eforts to spread God’s name among his creatures (Gen. Rab. 43:7). Indeed,\na passage in Genesis Rabbah asserts downright that “from the beginning of the creation of\nthe world, the Holy One, blessed be he, desired to make for himself a partnership [or asso-\nciation; shuttaput] with the beings below,” a partnership that is then assumed to have been\nrealised in the inauguration of the Israelite tabernacle as described in Numbers 7 (Gen. Rab.\n3:9). Interestingly, a line in Jacob of Sarug’s homily on creation similarly claims that Adam, in\ngiving names to God’s creatures, became an “associate” (shūtāpā) in the divine task of creation\n(Mathews 2020, 70–71, ll. 2361–2362). Though the m atter requires further investigation, it is\nnot impossible that Jacob is h ere taking up a Jewish theme.32 If so, it would provide scholars\nof the Qur’an with a gripping illustration of how the rabbinic discourse of partnering and\nassociating radiated into another religious community.\nWhat the preceding shows, in any case, is that rabbinic lit er a ture contains quite a few\npositive references to association or partnering between God and h uman: God does not\nhave associates, and h umans must not attribute associates to him on their own initiative;\nyet God may well take the initiative himself and bestow on certain humans the honour of\nelevating them to associate status (though even so it will be tacitly understood that this\ndoes not amount to deification). By contrast with this subtly nuanced notion of partner-\ning in the rabbinic tradition, the Qur’anic employment of the notion of shirk is uniformly\nconfrontational, giving no hint that God might decide to “associate” other beings with\nhimself. Hence, if the Qur’anic polemic against associationism was the adaptation of a\nrabbinic theme, which is currently the most plausible contextualisation of the Qur’anic use\nof ashraka, the adaptation involved a tangible recalibration: a complex notion that could\nserve both to articulate an uncompromising commitment to mono the ism and to posit a\nspecial communion between God and h umans (albeit one established entirely on God’s\nterms) morphed into an instrument of sweeping doctrinal criticism, deployed with great\nefect in challenging the pagan addressees who refused to heed the Qur’an’s eschatological\nappeals (HCI 174–176).33 The catalyst of the theological innovation that is represented by\nthe Qur’anic adaptation—or rather weaponisation—of the rabbinic notion of partnering\nor associating, then, was most likely the eschatological agnosticism of the Qur’an’s initial\ntarget audience, who came to be condemned as “ those who associate.”\nExcursus: Does Q 6:91 Imply That the Associators Recognised and Transmitted\nthe “Scripture Brought by Moses”?\nAccording to the Ḥafṣ ʿan ʿĀṣim reading of the verse, Q 6:91 begins by reporting the op-\nponents’ claim that “God has not sent anything down on a h uman” (mā anzala llāhu ʿalā\n32 For a pioneering overview of Jewish traditions in Syriac Christian lit er a ture, see Brock 1979.

To this, the Messenger is bidden to respond by asking his antagonists,\n“Who sent down the scripture that Moses brought as a light and guidance to the p eople?\nYoup turn it into sheets of papyrus, revealing them and hiding much (tajʿalūnahu qarāṭīsa\ntubdūnahā wa- tukhfūna kathīran); and youp w ere taught what you did not know, you and\nyour forefathers.” Given the beginning of the verse, it must be directed against the pagans or\nassociators, leading Crone to infer that “the polytheists accepted that Moses, a h uman being,\nhad received revelation, which they themselves were in the habit of copying on papyrus\nsheets” (QP 111). However, the condemnation of “concealing” or “hiding” (katama, akhfā;\nsee under → ˻ahl al- kitāb) scripture is other wise found in the context of Qur’anic polemics\nagainst the Jews or the “scripture- owners” rather than in connection with the associators\n(Q 2:146, 3:187, 5:15; see also 2:159.174, which are reasonably taken as directed against the\n“scripture- owners,” although the verses themselves or their immediate context do not explic-\nitly signal this). Th ere are moreover a number of passages that make it quite clear that the\nQur’an’s pagan opponents have not yet been given a scripture by God (e.g., Q 34:44, 43:21,\n68:37), even though they are expressly portrayed as being familiar with the figure of Moses\nand “that which was given to him” (Q 28:48; see above). Statements like Q 34:44 would be\nincomprehensible if indeed the pagans had been routinely engaged in copying down “the\nscripture brought by Moses.” Accordingly, Paret, too, finds the verse problematic (KK 147),\nas does Reynolds (Reynolds 2018, 235; Amir-M oezzi and Dye 2019, 2:253).\nThe foregoing difficulties make it distinctly preferable to opt for an alternative reading\nof the verse’s rasm (attributed inter alios to Ibn Kathīr and Abū ʿAmr) that has the third-\nperson plural verbs yajʿalūnahu, yubdūnahā, and yukhfūna instead of the second- person\nplural ones tajʿalūnahu, tubdūnahā, and tukhfūna (MQQ 2:292–293; MQ 2:483–485; see\nalready Goudarzi 2018, 145–146). All three verbs could then be parsed as an asyndetic rel-\native clause whose antecedent is al- nās, “the p eople.”34 Read thus, the segment “they turn\nit into sheets of papyrus” is best understood as a passing reference to the scripture- owners\nthat sits within an address of the pagan associators. All of this would produce the following\ntranslation: “SayS, ‘Who sent down the scripture that Moses brought as a light and guidance\nto the p eople (nūran wa- hudan li- l- nāsi), who turn it into sheets of papyrus, revealing them\nand hiding much (yajʿalūnahu qarāṭīsa yubdūnahā wa- yukhfūna kathīran)? And youp have\n[by virtue of the Qur’anic revelations] been taught what you did not know, you and your\nforefathers (wa-ʿ ullimtum mā lam taʿlamū antum wa- lā ābāʾukum).’ ” This interpretation\n(whose existence is briefly acknowledged, though without further discussion, in QP 111)\nis efectively identical with the preferred option in Ṭab. 9:397–398.\nBut why did the second- person readings tajʿalūnahu, tubdūnahā, and tukhfūna arise in\nthe first place? The reason was presumably that they brought the three verbs in question\nin line with the second person plural that is undeniably pre sent from wa-ʿ ullimtum (“and\nyou were taught”) onwards. Th ere is, accordingly, a reasonable contextual explanation for\nthe emergence of the second- person reading, despite the fact that it ended up giving rise\nto a grave interpretive difficulty. It is impor tant, though, to appreciate that Q 6:91 makes\nunproblematic sense even if, as I have just argued, it involves a shift from the third person\n34 According to the grammar of classical Arabic, asyndetic relative clauses ordinarily require an indefi-\nnite antecedent except in a narrow range of cases (Wright 1974, 317–318). However, this rule does not seem to\nbe applicable in the Qur’an (Jones 2005, 146). See, for instance, Q 4:87, 6:12, and 45:26: la- yajmaʿannakum/\nyajmaʿukum ilā yawmi l- qiyāmati lā rayba fīhi, “he will indeed assem ble youp to the day of resurrection about\nwhich there is no doubt.”\n442 ashraka", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As\nshown elsewhere, this is a feature that the Qur’an shares with previous Jewish and Christian\ndiscourse (→ ajr, → ḥisāb, → aqraḍa, → kasaba; cf. also Q 2:16 and Mark 8:36). It is in this\ntheological context that the verb ishtarā, which in its basic sense designates a transactional\nexchange in which one t hing is given away for another, tends to be employed in the Qur’an.\nDepending on the context, ishtarā can mean either “to sell” (for which the Qur’an also\nuses sharā) or “to buy, to purchase” (CDKA 148). The wider theological issues at stake in\nthe Qur’an’s use of commercial meta phors being discussed in the entries cross- referenced\nabove, the following is largely limited to syntactic remarks and questions of translation.\nThe two foremost syntactic structures formed with ishtarā are the following:\n(i) ishtarā X bi- Y: “to purchase X for Y”\n(ii) ishtarā bi-X thamanan / thamanan qalīlan: “to sell X for a price / for a small price”\nCategory (i) tends to be used in threatening or condemnatory statements in which X is\ntransparently less valuable than Y (Q 2:16.86.175, 3:177). Some verses belonging to this\ngroup lack the prepositional object Y (Q 4:44, 12:21, 31:6), and in one of t hese occurrences\nthe verb ishtarā may only carry the generic meaning “to acquire” (Q 2:102). In one case,\nstructure (i) occurs with God as the subject (Q 9:111: inna llāha shtarā mina l- muʾminīna\nanfusahum wa- amwālahum bi- anna lahumu l- jannata, “God has purchased from the be-\nlievers their lives and their possessions in exchange for the garden being theirs”); here\nthe negative connotation of other instances of (i) is lacking. Category (ii) is exemplified\nby Q 3:199: lā yashtarūna bi- āyāti llāhi thamanan qalīlan, “they do not sell God’s signs\nfor a cheap price.” Unlike the verb sharā = “to sell,” following which the object sold ap-\npears in the accusative (see Q 2:102.207, 4:74, 12:20), statements falling under (ii) instead\n35 Thus, ʿullimtum should not be taken to refer to the time of Moses but rather to the more recent historical\nmoment of Muhammad’s prophetic appearance.\nsharā 443", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In all t hese\nexamples, the prepositional object X is clearly intended to be more valuable than the “small\nprice” that is received in return for it. As for almost all instances of category (i), structures\nof type (ii) form condemnations, threats, or prohibitions and negations. Hence, the Qur’an\ngenerally uses ishtarā as a “term of reproach” (Torrey 1892, 36), although Q 9:111, noted\nabove, forms an exception.2\nChronological considerations and poetic attestations of the purchasing meta phor.\nMost of the Qur’an’s frequent occurrences of ishtarā, and also three of its four instances\nof sharā (Q 2:102.207, 4:74), are meta phorical (Torrey 1892, 35–40), although a literal\nmeaning of sharā and ishtarā is found in Q 12:20.21 (CDKA 148). Perhaps the earliest occur-\nrence of the buying-s elling meta phor is in Q 16:94–95, a later Meccan passage enjoining its\naddressees to keep their oaths and exhorting them, “Do not sell God’s covenant for a small\nprice” (wa- lā tashtarū bi-ʿ ahdi llāhi thamanan qalīlan). A similarly meta phorical usage of\nishtarā is attested in pre- Qur’anic poetry. Thus, a verse from the dīwān of ʿAlqamah states\nthat “praise” (al- ḥamd) is only “purchased” (yushtarā) for a “price” (thaman; DSAAP,\nʿAlqamah, no. 13:32; Torrey 1892, 37), while ʿUrwah ibn al- Ward announces his intention\nto purchase glory in return for his life or self (nafs; Nöldeke 1863, no. 3:2; Torrey 1892,\n39; EAP 1:129). The occurrence of thaman in the former example is of course particularly\nreminiscent of category (ii) above.\nshāʿir | poet\n→ jinn\nshaʿāʾir pl. | ritual observances\nmashʿar | place where a ritual is performed\n→ ḥajja, → ḥarrama, → dhabaḥa\nshafaʿa intr.

Efec-\ntively, ishtarā is h ere employed in exactly the same way as sharā (cf. Q 2:102: wa- la- biʾsa mā sharaw bihi anfusahum).\n444 shāʿir", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Together with the general assertion that God “does what he wants” (Q 2:253,\n22:14: yafʿalu mā yurīd; see also 11:107 and 85:16: faʿʿālun li- mā yurīd), one might well infer\nfrom such Qur’anic verses that God arbitrarily and inscrutably selects some humans for\nguidance and o thers for error and unbelief. Further confirmation of such a view might be\ndiscerned in Q 6:125: “whom God wills to guide, he opens up his breast to self- surrender\n(fa- man yuridi llāhu an yahdiyahu yashraḥ ṣadrahu li- l- islāmi), and whom he w ills to lead\nastray, he makes his breast narrow and constricted.”\nYet a more detailed analy sis, undertaken in the entry on → hadā, makes such a predes-\ntinarian reading of Qur’anic references to divine volition on balance unlikely: even if God\nguides whom he wills, it would seem that those whom he in fact elects to guide are those\nwho deserve to be guided, given the frequent assertions that God “does not guide the p eople\nwho are wrongdoers/repudiators/sinners” (lā yahdī l- qawma l- ẓālimīn/kāfirīn/fāsiqīn;\ne.g., Q 2:258.264, 5:108). Moreover, it is categorically and repeatedly asserted that God does\nnot inflict wrong upon humans (e.g., Q 3:108.182; for more detail, see under → ẓalama).\nThe Qur’an, then, sim ul ta neously ascribes untrammelled omnipotence to God and main-\ntains that God responds to righ teousness and sin with humanly comprehensible fairness.\nHence, God could bestow guidance upon t hose who do not merit it, making it true to assert\nthat he “ causes to enter into his mercy whomever he w ills” (Q 42:8, 76:31: yudkhilu man\nyashāʾu fī raḥmatihi; similarly 48:25); yet God nonetheless appears to refrain from using\nthis power in a manner that would violate basic h uman intuitions of justice and freely binds\nhis actions to intelligible standards of equity. Divine omnipotence is therefore located not\nin the domain of the factual but rather in the domain of the potential, in the realm of what\nGod could do—w ithout necessarily d oing it in real ity. Th ere are, in other words, unrealised\ndivine possibilities, an idea that recalls Augustine’s phrase potuit sed noluit (God “was able\nto but did not want to”; see Knuuttila 2020, 68–69, and cf. Courtenay 1973, 80–81).\nThe impor tant role that counterfactual or, as phi los o phers might say, “modal” aspects\nplay in the Qur’anic understanding of divine omnipotence in relation to human agency\nis also exemplified by statements like Q 6:35, according to which God could have made\nevery one conform to his guidance if only he “had willed” (law shāʾa llāhu). God, that is,\nwould have been perfectly able to ensure that all humans behave as they ought to, yet\nchose not to realise this possibility, presumably b ecause he instead dec ided to create and\nmaintain a world that can serve as an efective testing ground geared to ascertaining moral\nmerit (see under → balā). Other occurrences of the theological counterfactual “had God\nwilled” (law shāʾa llāhu) are similarly capable of being understood in a way that steers\nclear of divine predestination, even though there is arguably scope for exegetical debate\n(see in more detail under → hadā).\nThe dependence of human volition on divine volition in Q 74:56, 76:30, and 81:29.\nPerhaps the most difficult interpretive impediment to a non-p redestinarian reading of the\nQur’an is posed by Q 74:56, 76:30, and 81:29. Like the passages just examined, these verses\nemploy the verb shāʾa with God as the grammatical subject, and each of them follows what\nseems to be a clear affirmation of h uman freedom of w ill. Thus, the immediately preceding\nverses Q 74:55, 76:29, and 81:28 state that “whoever w ills” (man shāʾa) may heed God’s\nexhortation, may embark on the path to his Lord, or may “keep a straight course” (see\n446 shāʾa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In what sense, then, do Q 74:56, 76:30, and 81:29 assert a\ndependence of human volition on divine volition?\nA common response to the question, attractive to interpreters who are persuaded by\na predestinarian interpretation of at least some Qur’anic passages, is that at least from\nthe later Meccan period onwards the Qur’an teaches that even the most incipient human\nmovement t owards God is predetermined by the latter’s inscrutable w ill (see, e.g., the un-\nderstanding of Q 10:100 in Grimme 1895, 119, and Ringgren 1951, 20). On this interpretation,\na passage like Q 81:28–29 at once recognises that h uman agents experience themselves to be\nfreely choosing between alternative courses of action (in v. 28) yet proceeds to subordinate\nthis psychological truth to the ultimate metaphysical truth of divine determinism (in v. 29).\nThe ostensible conflict between t hese two perspectives could then be defused by saying that\nwhether the Qur’an considers matters “from a human vantage point” (Andrae 1932, 53)\nor whether it instead adopts the vantage point of divine determinism depends simply on\n“that which is in each case the aim of the revelation” (Ringgren 1951, 20)— namely, w hether\nthe text is exhorting its addressees to change their ways (an objective encouraging an em-\nphasis on human freedom of will) or is seeking to provide an explanation for the fact that\nso many of these addressees fail to heed Muhammad’s preaching (which would be served\nby positing divine determinism). On such a dual- perspective reading, Q 74:56, 76:30, and\n81:29 provide particularly cogent prooftexts that the Qur’an ultimately endorses a hard\ndivine determinism. This interpretation, fi nally, could be tied to yet another occurrence\nof the formula illā an yashāʾa llāhu: according to Q 18:23–24, any announcement of future\nintentions, such as “I shall do this tomorrow,” ought to be made dependent on the proviso\n“ unless God w ills [other wise]” (wa- lā taqūlanna li- shayʾin innī fāʿilun dhālika ghadā // illā\nan yashāʾa llāhu). This could be taken to mean that humans simply have no reliable way of\nanticipating, and no control over, what God will make them do tomorrow.\nIt might be unwise to posit that all Qur’anic passages with a deterministic or pre-\ndestinarian ring are amenable to being reinterpreted in a non-p redestinarian manner.\nYet, as argued both in the pre sent entry and elsewhere (see under → khatama, → ḍalla,\nand → hadā), non-p redestinarian readings of such Qur’anic data can turn out to be far more\n1 For further occurrences of illā an yashāʾa llāhu, see Q 6:111, 7:89, 12:76, 18:24 (and similarly 6:80); for in\nshāʾa llāhu, see Q 2:70, 12:99, 18:69, 28:27, 37:102, 48:27. For an approximate Syriac parallel of illā an yashāʾa\nllāhu, though not in connection with human action but rather regarding the efects of a natu ral ele ment, see\nMathews 2018, 20–21, ll. 1284: fire would not be able to burn anything, Jacob of Sarug says, “u nless the Lord—i ts\nLord— wills it” (kad lā ṣābē māryā mārāh; translation modified).\nshāʾa 447", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Such an\nunderstanding finds strong support in Q 10:100: “no one has the power to believe except\nwith God’s permission” (wa- mā kāna li- nafsin an tuʾmina illā bi- idhni llāhi). Thus, even\nif divine endorsement of h uman stirrings t owards belief could in princip le be withheld,\nmeaning that God could choose to prevent anything that humans might strive to do, this\ndoes not as such render God a determining cause of human acts and decisions. Rather, the\npoint is merely that the occurrence of any h uman act, w hether external or m ental, requires\nthat God abstain from counteracting or overriding it. On this reading, the Qur’an is only\nconcerned to reserve for God a ubiquitous power of veto over all human actions, without\nimplying that God is therefore the sufficient cause of what h umans actually choose to do. In\ncontrast to natur al pro cesses, therefore, in which God is causally enmeshed on a permanent\nbasis (see u nder → allāh), rational agents like h umans are endowed with a certain sphere\nof autonomous action, even if God retains the power to override their agency.\nHuman action and divine “permission” (idhn). The preceding interpretation of the\nQur’anic illā an yashāʾa llāhu proviso is buttressed by the fact that the appeal to divine\n“permission” in Q 10:100, cited in the preceding paragraph, is far from an isolated case.\nReferences to divine “permission” are in fact a proper topos in the Islamic scripture:\nover thirty verses, both Meccan and Medinan, stress that par tic u lar actions or events\nhappen, have happened, or will happen only “with God’s permission” (bi-i dhni llāhi\nor its pronominal variant bi-i dhnihi; e.g., Q 2:102.213.249.251, 3:49.152, 13:38, 40:78,\n58:10, 59:5; see also Decharneux 2019, 246–248). Although the phrase is predominant\nwith regard to human actions, it is sometimes extended to the natu ral domain as well:\nvegetation comes forth “with the permission of its Lord,” Q 7:58 says (cf. also 14:25),\nand it would only be with God’s “permission” that the sky (→ al-s amāʾ) might collapse\nupon the earth (Q 22:65).\nAgainst the background of this frequent Qur’anic use of the noun idhn, “permission,”\nwe may contrast a deterministic reading of passages like Q 81:28–29, which stands in ten-\nsion with Qur’anic denials of divine wrongdoing and unfairness, with a “permissivist” one:\nseeing that God is in princip le capable of thwarting or overriding any h uman action, t hose\nactions that do in fact materialise can be inferred to have received God’s tacit approval or\n“permission,” in the sense that God must have chosen not to exercise his power to intervene\nand to impede or redirect the a ctual course of occurrences. If God can inhibit any event or\naction in the world, then m ental acts such as “willing to keep a straight course,” too, must\nbe subject to a second- order divine volition to let the h uman volition at hand unfold without\nhindrance (Q 81:28–29). This does not, however, entail that it is God who prompted the\nact in question in the first place. Q 10:100 in par tic ul ar provides good evidence supporting\nsuch a permissivist construal over a predestinarian one, since the assertion that “no one has\nthe power to believe except with God’s permission” is followed by the statement that God\n“imposes punishment on t hose who do not understand” (wa-y ajʿalu l-r ijsa ʿalā lladhīna lā\n2 See especially the discussion of Q 17:16, a verse that looks starkly deterministic, u nder → khatama.\n448 shāʾa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is also notable that quite a few assertions of h uman volition— e.g., Q 73:19:\n“whoever w ills takes the path to his Lord” (fa- man shāʾa ttakhadha ilā rabbihi sabīlā; see\nalso Q 18:29, 74:37, 78:39, 80:12)—a re not followed by caveats that explic itly subject them\nto a second- order divine volition of the sort that figures in Q 74:56, 76:30, and 81:29. This,\ntoo, suggests that the point of qualifiers like Q 81:29 is not to deny human freedom as\nsuch—i .e., the ability to do X or to omit it (or do something e lse in its stead)—or to convey\nthat it is God who makes h umans want what ever they want. Rather, Q 81:29 and its parallels\nserve to stress that not only external actions on which h umans might resolve but also the\nvery act of coming to a m ental resolution itself depend on a divine decision to abstain from\nintervention, each and e very time a h uman agent comes to such a resolution.\nAccording to the “permissivist” interpretation just developed, God, though omnipo-\ntent, engages in almost incessant self- restraint towards the human agents he has created,\ndesisting from exercising his absolute power to prevent or redirect what they might re-\nsolve to do and granting them the exercise of autonomous agency. Read thus, the Qur’an\nreconciles divine omnipotence and h uman freedom by asserting that divine agency could\nin princi ple always override and blot out any other source of agency. Once again, the\nconclusion is that with regard to human agency, divine omnipotence resides in the realm\nof the pos si ble or counterfactual, not in the realm of the a ctual. Alternatively, one might\nsay that when it comes to h uman actions, the Qur’anic God is omnipotent (i.e., able to do\nanything that is not a logical impossibility) but not omnificent (i.e., causing every thing\nthat actually happens).\nGod’s del e ga tion of agency to humans in early post- Qur’anic theology. By way of\nan addendum, it is appropriate to acknowledge that the preceding exposition of how\ndivine omnipotence relates to human agency in the Qur’an is not dissimilar to the way\nin which the early Muʿtazilite Abū l- Hudhayl appears to have envisaged the matter. Ac-\ncording to al- Ashʿarī’s doxography of early Islamic theologians, Abū l- Hudhayl held that\nGod delegates to humans the power (yuqaddiru ʿalā) to accomplish certain efects (al-\nAshʿarī 1963, 549, ll. 10–11; see also al- Ashʿarī 1963, 378, ll. 8–13).4 At the same time, Abū\nl- Hudhayl was evidently concerned to uphold divine omnipotence as well: for example,\nhe reportedly declared it to be pos si ble (jawwaza) that God might cause a piece of cotton\nto be located next to fire without being consumed by it (al- Ashʿarī 1963, 312, ll. 10–12;\nRudolph 2016b, 350). Nonetheless, to cite Ulrich Rudolph’s explication of Abū l- Hudhayl’s\n3 My translation assumes that rijs (literally, “filth”) is here employed in the sense of the phonetically similar\nword rijz. As shown elsewhere (→ rijz/rujz), other Qur’anic passages also attest to a certain degree of conflation\nbetween the two terms.\n4 I owe my awareness of both passages to van Ess 1991–1997, 5:402–404. Note, however, that al- Ashʿarī’s\ntestimony adds that this view was coupled with the claim that God could not therefore be described as possessing\npower (qudrah) over things over which he has empowered his servants, since “it is impossible that one and the\nsame object of power”—i .e., one and the same event or course of action—“ might come u nder the power of two\nagents” (al- Ashʿarī 1963, 549, ll. 10–11: lā yūṣafu l- bāriʾu bi- l- qudrati ʿalā shayʾin yuqaddiru ʿalayhi ʿibādahu wa-\nmuḥālun an yakūna maqdūrun wāḥidun li- qādirayn). This inference stands in tension with the literal wording of\nthe frequent Qur’anic assertion that God is “endowed with power over all t hings” (see u nder → qadīr). However,\nit would be easy to make appropriate qualifications and say that God is intrinsically, originally, or absolutely\nendowed with power over all t hings, but that he “relinquishes” or “divests himself of” his executive power over\nhuman actions (van Ess 2017–2020, 3:298). Presumably, God could also revoke this del e ga tion of agency to\nhumans, which means that his original or absolute power remains in place.\nshāʾa 449", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an exhibits a dual use of\nthe word shayṭān. First, the definite singular al- shayṭān designates an individual diabolic\ntempter—“ the devil” or “Satan”–w hom God has given leave to attempt to incite h umans\nto evil, thus helping to separate God’s faithful “servants” from the rest of humanity. Al-\nshayṭān or the devil is said to seduce h umans by “whispering” to them (waswasa; Q 7:20,\n20:120; see also 114:4–5) or by “persuading” them (sawwala li-) to apostasy (Q 47:25). Both\nwaswasa and sawwala are also applied to the h uman vital self or → nafs (Q 12:18.83, 20:96,\n50:16; see Witztum 2011, 134–136), which accordingly emerges as the primary psychological\nbreach exploited by the devil. The devil can, moreover, cause h umans to forget (ansā) God’s\nreminding exhortation (Q 58:19: fa- ansāhum dhikra llāhi; see also Q 6:68, 12:42, 18:63),1\nthus exploiting the innate h uman tendency to forget (→ nasiya) vital religious truths. This\nQur’anic tempter figure is recognisably an iteration of the heavenly “adversary” or “ac-\ncuser” (Hebrew: haśśāṭān, Syriac: sāṭānā, Gәʿәz: sayṭān) appearing in Job 1–2 (NIDOTTE\n3:1231–1232), whose primordial fall from God’s presence and role in the fall of Adam and\nEve are narrated in pre- Qur’anic sources like the Life of Adam and Eve, popul ar among\n1 Alternatively, dhikr allāh might mean the obligation of invoking God here; see under → dhakara.\n450 shayʾ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Although t here is a strong etymological argument for\ntranslating the definite al- shayṭān as “Satan,” a consistent rendering of the word shayṭān\nas “devil” enables En glish readers to appreciate the lexical connection that must have\nsuggested itself to the Qur’an’s recipients between al- shayṭān, “the devil” par excellence,\nand al- shayāṭīn, “the dev ils,” meaning evil demons.2\nSince the Qur’an’s general portrayal of the → jinn is treated elsewhere, the pre sent\nentry begins by examining the relationship between the shayāṭīn or “dev ils” and the jinn in\ngeneral, substantiating the foregoing claim that the plural shayāṭīn normally signifies ma-\nlevolent jinn. The focus then turns to one particularly impor tant function of the shayāṭīn,\nthat of serving as companion demons whom God assigns to tempt those who have rejected\nhim. This is followed by a fairly detailed investigation into “the devil” par excellence or\nSatan, al- shayṭān, whom the Qur’an also calls iblīs. Special attention is commanded by the\nprob lem w hether the Qur’an understands Iblīs to have originally been an angel, in line with\ncertain Christian traditions. The answer given below is negative; Iblīs is identified as one of\nthe jinn in Q 18:50, and this appears to be the consistent Qur’anic assessment of him. After\nhaving been expelled from God’s presence due to insubordination, the principal function\nof Iblīs or al- shayṭān is to serve as a source of moral temptation, similar to the companion\ndemons mentioned earlier. Following some remarks on the relationship between Satan\n(al- shayṭān) and the dev ils (al- shayāṭīn), the final section of the entry pursues the thorny\nand partially inconclusive question of the etymological origin of the word shayṭān and its\nmeaning in pre- Qur’anic Arabic.\n“The dev ils” (al-s hayāṭīn) and the jinn. There are at least some Qur’anic passages\nin which the expressions “the jinn” and “the dev ils” (al-s hayāṭīn) are employed inter-\nchangeably. Thus, the text states that God’s celestial council or “the assembly on high”\n(→ ˻al- malaʾ al- aʿlā) is protected both against eavesdropping shayāṭīn (Q 15:17–18, 26:212,\n37:7–10, 67:5) and against eavesdropping jinn (Q 72:8–9; see under → jinn). In connection\nwith Solomon’s God- given rule over super natural beings, too, the Qur’an speaks both of\nthe jinn (Q 27:17.39, 34:12) and of the shayāṭīn (Q 21:82, 38:37–38; see again in more detail\nunder → jinn). This apparent interchangeability could be taken to indicate that the two\nwords are equivalent (Chabbi 2003, 44; see also Chabbi 2020, 187). More likely, how-\never, is that al- shayāṭīn or “the dev ils” picks out the subclass of jinn who are malicious, as\nopposed to the believing jinn who appear, for instance, in Q 72:1–19 (see Welch 1979,\n744–745, and also Nünlist 2015, 60–61).3 Unlike the morally neutral species term jinn, the\nword shayṭān evidently has a negative valence throughout the Qur’an: even in cases where\nit is used as a common noun rather than to name the devil or Satan (al-s hayṭān), it is\nconnected with the attributes → rajīm, “deserving to be pelted” (Q 15:17, 81:25), and mārid\n2 Speaking from a purely etymological viewpoint, it is the Qur’anic proper name Iblīs that is related to the\nEn glish word “devil,” given its connection with Greek ho diabolos, “the devil” (FVQ 47–48).\n3 The link between the shayāṭīn and the jinn is also pointed out in Durie 2018, 183–184, who notes, much\nlike my own understanding, that the “shayāṭīn are not a dif er ent order of created being, unlike h umans or the\njinn, but a role which can be played by either.” On human shayāṭīn, see below.\nshayṭān 451", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

One noteworthy function of the Qur’anic dev ils or shayāṭīn,\nwhich echoes the late antique Christian understanding of demons as a source of moral\ntemptation (see under → jinn), is to bedevil those who have turned away from God\n(Q 43:36): “Whoever is blind to the reminding exhortation (→ dhikr) of the Merciful, we\nassign to him (nuqayyiḍ lahu) a devil to be his companion (qarīn).” Th ese dev ils, the follow-\ning verse (Q 43:37) continues, “turn” their victims “away from the path” (la- yaṣuddūnahum\nʿani l- sabīli; → sabīl) while encouraging them in the delusion that they are in fact guided\n(wa- yaḥsabūna annahum muhtadūn). When confronted with the divine judge, however,\na companion demon will disavow his human counterpart (Q 43:38). The idea that “God’s\nenemies” (Q 41:19) have been assigned (qayyaḍa) “companions” (qur anāʾ) whose task is to\nconfirm sinners and unbelievers on the path to hell is also found in Q 41:25. The Qur’anic\ncontention that it is God who assigns t hese companion demons can be contrasted with\nthe observation that rabbinic lit er a ture never maintains that demonic afflictions are sent\nby God and instead assumes that demonic assault is due to an “ele ment of randomness”\n(Bohak 2017, 129–131).\nQ 50:23–27 (on which see DTEK 108–110) cite a brief address delivered by one such\ncompanion demon or qarīn on the occasion of the eschatological judgement, the gist of the\nspeech again being disavowal of his human victim. The address climaxes in the assertion\nthat the latter bears full moral responsibility for his own moral rec ord (Q 50:27): “Our\nLord, I did not cause him to transgress (mā aṭghaytuhu); rather, he has [himself] gone\nfar astray (wa- lākin kāna fī ḍalālin baʿīd).” Although the passage clearly understands the\ncompanion demon to merit divine punishment as well, the latter’s defence underlines a\npoint also made in Q 43:36, namely, that God w ill only allot companion demons to t hose\nhumans who have already rejected his exhortation.7 This is in line with other Qur’anic\n4 Note that the cognate root m- r- d is employed to characterise Satan and his minions in the Cave of Trea sures\n(Ri 1987, ch. 3:3; see also ch. 3:1 in Ri’s Eastern manuscript group).\n5 For the negative valence of al- shayāṭīn, see also Q 19:68.83.\n6 The shayāṭīn of Q 2:14 could also be the companion demons discussed further below. However, given\nthat the verse reports an exchange between the sick of heart and their shayāṭīn, it seems more likely that both\nparties here are human. This is further supported by the parallel between Q 2:14 and 2:76 (to which I was alerted\nby Saqib Hussain).\n7 Also relevant in this context is Q 6:137, where the Qur’anic associators’ partner deities (shurakāʾ) are said\nto be responsible for making infanticide appear alluring or desirable (zayyana) to the associators, and Q 41:25,\nwhich predicates the same verb (on which see further below) of the companion demons. On the notion that\nGod’s alleged partner deities are really demons or jinn, see QP 75–77, citing inter alia Q 6:100 (“They have made\nthe jinn God’s partners,” wa- jaʿalū li- llāhi shurakāʾa l- jinna) and the accusation of jinn worship in 34:41.\n452 shayṭān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In addition to a multitude of demonic fiends or dev ils, the Qur’an de-\nvotes considerable narrative space to Satan or “the devil” par excellence, al- shayṭān, who also\nfigures u nder the designation iblīs, which is descended from Greek ho diabolos, “the devil”\n(WMJA 98; BEḲ 41; FVQ 47–48) and should perhaps be treated as a proper name of sorts.\nAfter refusing to obey God’s command to prostrate himself (→ sajada) to the newly created\nAdam, Iblīs is expelled from God’s retinue and subsequently retaliates against his nemesis\nAdam by persuading him and Eve to eat from the forbidden tree (e.g., Q 2:34–39, 7:11–25,\nand 20:115–124; for more detail, see BEQ 54–60; HCI 143–148; Zellentin 2017).\nIt is only after his expulsion, when acting as mankind’s tempter and arch- enemy, that\nIblīs is called al- shayṭān (cf. Q 2:34 with 2:36, 7:11 with 7:20.22, and 20:116 with 20:120).\nFrom this, one might infer that the Qur’an is operating a terminological distinction be-\ntween the devil qua rebel, called iblīs, and the devil qua tempter, called al- shayṭān (Reyn-\nolds 2010a, 40 and 54). This apparent “onomastic shift” has an ostensible parallel in the\nSyriac Cave of Trea sures (Tesei 2016, 67–68; see also Radscheit 2010, 110, and Zellentin\n2017, 104): the “chief” of the “lower order” of angels or spiritual beings refused to venerate\nAdam, the antetype of Jesus, and thus “separated himself from God” out of his “own free\nwill”; therefore, the Cave of Trea sures explains, the primordial rebel was called “Satan,”\na name that is folk- etymologically derived from e ither asṭī or sṭā, two verbs meaning “to\nturn aside,” “to go astray” (Ri 1987, ch. 3:1–6; see BEQ 57–58 and HCI 145–147).8 The same\netymology also features in Jacob of Sarug, at a comparable point in the storyline, namely, a fter\nthe devil became envious of the newly created Adam (Mathews 2020, 90–91, ll. 2531–2534):\n“Immediately he fell from among the holy ones and the beautiful ones, // and he went\nastray (asṭī) to corrupt [Adam]; for this reason he is called Satan (sāṭānā). // For the Lord\ndid not create him ‘Satan’ when He created him, but because he went astray (asṭī), he was\ngiven the name ‘Satan.’ ”9\nDespite being prima facie compelling, however, the parallel just presented is open to\nchallenge,10 for the impression that the Qur’anic Adam narratives exhibit an “onomastic\nshift” from iblīs the rebel to al-s hayṭān the tempter is exclusively a consequence of the fact\nthat the name iblīs is strongly associated with the formula fa-s ajadū illā iblīsa, “and they\n[the angels] prostrated themselves [to Adam]; not so Iblīs”: nine of the Qur’an’s eleven\noccurrences of iblīs consist in this set phrase (Q 2:34, 7:11, 17:61, 18:50, 20:116), in close\nvariants thereof (Q 15:30–31, 38:73–74), or in an immediately following divine address\nof Iblīs (Q 15:32, 38:75: yā- iblīsu, “O Iblīs”). As for the two remaining occurrences of\n8 For the most recent examination of the date and provenance of the Cave of Trea sures, see Minov 2021,\n18–48. Minov is particularly critical of Ri’s edition and the latter’s grouping of the extant manuscripts into two\nrecensions, a Western and an Eastern one (Minov 2021, 32–36).

The phenomenon to be\nexplained, then, is less an onomastic shift between two subsequent narrative episodes\nthan the formulaic combination of the prostration formula (fa-s ajadū . . .) with the name\niblīs rather than with al-s hayṭān. Yet the parallels from the Cave of Trea sures and Jacob\nof Sarug do not ofer much help in accounting for this formulaic feature. If anything, the\nfolk- etymological link they posit between the name “Satan” and the notion of deviation\nmight have led one to expect the formula to include al-s hayṭān rather than iblīs. The best\nexplanation one can construct is perhaps to conjecture that the formula fa- sajadū illā iblīsa\nreached the Qur’anic milieu as a set phrase that had been coined in prior Arabophone\nnarrative traditions. If that is the case, then iblīs and al-s hayṭān were most likely simply\nvariant Arabic designations for the devil that surfaced in dif er ent regions or circles or\nArabic speakers, the one under the impact of Greek diabolos, the other likely under the\nimpact of Ethiopic sayṭān (see below). The hypothesis just put forward is strengthened\nby the fact that there is at least one other Qur’anic narrative formula for which a similar\npre- Qur’anic origin can be established, namely, the phrase that God “blew some of his\nspirit into” Adam or Mary (nafakhtu/nafakha/nafakhnā fīhi/fīhā min rūḥī/rūḥihi/rūḥinā ;\ne.g., Q 15:29, 21:91; see under → rūḥ).\nWas Iblīs originally an angel? The Qur’an’s standard formula for reporting Iblīs’s disobe-\ndience is of interest for a second reason as well: it may give the initial impression that prior\nto his fall Iblīs belonged to the angels (e.g., Ṭab. 1:535–543, DTEK 120, and Chabbi 2020,\n198; see also Awn 1983, 26). Thus, the Arabic phrase qulnā li- l- malāʾikati sjudū li-ā dama fa-\nsajadū illā iblīsa (Q 2:34, 7:11, 17:61, 18:50, 20:116; see also 15:30–31 and 38:73–74) is naturally\nrendered, “We said to the angels, ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam,’ and they prostrated them-\nselves, except for Iblīs.” This reading would be in line, for instance, with the view of Jacob\nof Sarug, who unequivocally declares Satan to have been an angel (Mathews 2020, 88–89,\nl. 2515; see in more detail below). However, one of the Qur’anic passages just referenced\nexplic itly adds that Iblīs was in fact one of the jinn (Q 18:50: fa-s ajadū illā iblīsa kāna\nmina l-j inni). At least on the premise that angels and jinn are distinct species—an assump-\ntion borne out by Q 34:40–41, where they are treated as two separate and non- overlapping\ngroups— Q 18:50 entails the Qur’an does not consider Iblīs to be a fallen angel. In fact, the\nunderstanding that Iblīs was a jinni would seem to be implicit in the Qur’an as early as\nQ 38:76 (see also 7:12), where Iblīs justifies his refusal to prostrate to Adam by citing his\nown creation from fire, as opposed to Adam’s creation from the inferior substance of clay:\nhis rationale clearly harks back to Q 55:14–15 and 15:26–27, which juxtapose the creation\nof humans from clay with that of the jinn from fire.11 A further reason to suppose that the\n11 Note that Q 15:26–27 directly precedes another Qur’anic retelling of the disobedience of Iblīs, thereby\nreinforcing the link between this narrative and 55:14–15 (HCI 151–152). The Cave of Trea sures preserves a close\nparallel to Iblīs’s protestation at being ordered to bow to Adam (Q 7:12 and 38:76: “I am better than him; you\nhave created me from fire and him from clay”): “It is appropriate that he should worship me, because I am fire\nand spirit” (Ri 1987, Western manuscript group, ch. 3:2, and similarly in British Museum, Add.

Not so Iblīs.”13 The same understanding is feasibly extended to\nQ 15:30–31 and 38:73–74, which—in keeping with the ambient rhyme— expand the formula\nfound in 2:34 and its parallels to fa- sajada l- malāʾikatu kulluhum ajmaʿūn // illā iblīsa abā/\nstakbara . . . (“And the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together. // Not so Iblīs.\nHe refused / behaved haughtily . . .”). A slight difficulty with this approach, however, is\nthat there is a batch of verses in the Qur’anic Lot narratives that exhibit a very similar use\nof illā (Q 7:83, 11:81, 15:59–60, 26:170–171, 27:57, 29:32.33, 37:134–135) but which are most\nstraightforwardly construed as exceptive rather than adversative.14 These ostensible syn-\ntactic parallels may well incline one to favour an exceptive reading of illā in the context of\nthe Iblīs narrative as well, even if the carry- over could of course be resisted.\nIn any case, even if one does opt for the exceptive rather than the adversative reading—\nor, in the terminology of Arabic grammarians, for construing illā as a “continuous” excep-\ntion (istithnāʾ muttaṣil)—it is not necessarily a foregone conclusion that Iblīs must have been\nan angel. Thus, al- Zamaksharī espouses a continuous construal of illā (though he admits that\na discontinuous one is also pos sib le) in his commentary on Q 2:34 (Zam. 1:254) and l ater on\nexplains, apropos of Q 15:30–31 (Zam. 3:405): “Iblīs was excepted from the angels b ecause\nhe was among them, having been commanded to prostrate himself together with them\n(maʾmūran maʿahum bi- l- sujūd). Thus, the term ‘angels’ was predominant, and he [Iblīs]\nfire (see, e.g., Muehlberger 2013, 35–36, on Evagrius of Pontus, who says that in angels fire is predominant over\nother ele ments). It is not impossible that the Qur’an similarly assumes that angels have a fiery nature, but this\nis never explic itly stated. In the later Islamic tradition, one finds the contention that while the jinn were created\nfrom fire, the angels were created from light (Burge 2012, 100, 114–115).\n12 See al-M āturīdī 2005–2007, 1:83, who adduces the following example (although he does not use the tech-\nnical term munqaṭiʿ): “The p eople of Kufa entered this h ouse, but not so (illā) one of the inhabitants of Medina.”\nIt should be noted that the Islamic tradition transmits both the readings illā iblīsa in the accusative and illā iblīsu\nin the nominative; in the latter case, illā is said to be equivalent to the sentence- opening conjunctions “and” or\n“but” (MQ 1:80; see also MQQ 1:46). However, this should not be considered to provide additional confirmation\nin favour of understanding illā as discontinuous, over and above the arguments put forward in the main text,\nsince the reading in the nominative could simply reflect secondary exegetical speculation. On istithnāʾ munqaṭiʿ,\nsee also Blankinship 2020, 72–78.\n13 See also EAP 2:39, proposing that illā in the Qur’an frequently has the meaning “though this is not the\ncase with.” For two adversative cases of illā (which I owe to Ohad Kayam), see Q 26:89 and 37:40.\n14 The relevant passages fall into two groups. First, Q 7:83, 27:57, and 29:32.33 all state that God has deliv-\nered or will deliver Lot and his family, “except for his wife; she remained behind” or similarly (illā mraʾatahu/\nmraʾataka kānat/qaddarnāhā mina l- ghābirīn; see also Q 11:81). Secondly, Q 15:59–60, 26:170–171, and 37:134–135\nvary the preceding by employing enjambment and making use of ajmaʿīn as a rhyme word, similar to 15:30–31\nand 38:73–74. For instance, Q 26:170–171 reports that “we delivered Lot and his entire f amily // except for an\nold w oman who stayed b ehind” (fa- najjaynāhu wa-a hlahu ajmaʿīn // illā ʿajūzan fī l- ghābirīn). Obviously, the old\nwoman at hand is Lot’s wife, who according to Gen 19:26 looked back when fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah and\nwas turned into a pillar of salt. In all of these passages, illā is most naturally understood as having an exceptive\nfunction, since Lot’s wife is a member of his family.\nshayṭān 455", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The upshot is that w hether illā is discontinuous or\ncontinuous, it is not linguistically impossible to understand the particle in a manner that\navoids the inference that Iblīs belonged to the same species as the angels.\nAt the same time, it o ught to be conceded that w ere it not for Q 38:76 and 18:50, the most\nstraightforward and uncontrived reading of fa- sajadū illā iblīsa and its variants would surely\nbe “they prostrated themselves, except for Iblīs,” including the implication that Iblīs was\nindeed one of the angels. At least to some degree, then, the conundrum remains, despite\nthe considerable grammatical ingenuity displayed by Muslim exegetes. Ultimately, a more\nsatisfactory manner of resolving the prob lem is to revisit the hypothesis developed earlier\nthat the formula fa- sajadū illā iblīsa might be a residue of pre- Qur’anic narrative tradition\nthat was only a dopted by the Qur’an, not coined by it. For this conjecture opens up the\npossibility that the disobedience formula might originally have been at home in a version\nof the Adam story in which the devil was squarely taken to be a fallen angel, with the phrase\nfa- sajadū illā iblīsa being understood in the straightforward and uncontrived sense just\nnoted. Subsequently, however, the formula was inherited by the Qur’anic proclamations,\nwhich at least from Q 38:76 onwards cast the devil as a jinni and also presuppose fairly con-\nsistently that angels do not disobey God (see u nder → malak). Against the background of\nthese additional Qur’anic commitments, the meaning of illā in the set phrase fa- sajadū illā\niblīsa would then quite naturally have been interpretively adjusted in such a way as to be\ncompatible with Iblīs’s identity as a jinni. This reinterpretation would have been operative\nat least from Q 38:73–76 onwards and quite possibly as early as the chronologically earliest\nversion of the story of Iblīs’s insubordination in Q 15:28–43.\nThe separateness from the angels with which the Qur’an endows Iblīs is, in any case,\nnot completely unpre ce dented. As Tommaso Tesei has observed, the fact that the Qur’anic\naccounts of the fall of Iblīs place him in close proximity to the angels while nonetheless\nidentifying him as a jinni may be connected to a certain ambivalence with which the\nnature of Satan and his minions is characterised in the Syriac Cave of Trea sures (Tesei\n2016, 76). Thus, some manuscripts of the Cave of Trea sures introduce the future Satan as\nthe “chief” of the “lower order” (tegmā; Ri 1987, Western manuscript group, ch. 3:1),16\nmeaning a lower order of angels. At first sight, the main inference one is likely to draw\nfrom the statement is that Satan is a fallen angel, a view unequivocally endorsed by Jacob\nof Sarug (Mathews 2020, 88–89, l. 2515).17 Yet one must not overlook the concomitant\ndistinction between dif er ent classes or “ orders” (singular: tegmā) of angels, a distinction\nalso found in Jacob, who speaks of an “exalted” order, a “lesser one,” and a “lowly one,\nwhich is the rank that fell” (Mathews 2009, 30–31, ll. 197–198). It was clearly pos si ble for\n15 Al- Zamaksharī illustrates this phenomenon of discursive predominance by pointing to the use of the\nmasculine pronoun for a group that also includes a female (raʾaytuhum illā hindan).\n16 The reference to the “chief of the lower order” is also contained in the manuscript British Museum, Add.\nMss. 25875 (Ri’s “OrA”). Cf. similarly Mathews 2020, 88–89, ll. 2517–2524.\n17 At one point, some manuscripts of the Cave of Trea sures expressly describe Satan as “one of the cherubim\nwho fell” (Ri 1987, Western manuscript group, no. 18:15; Tesei 2016, 76). On Satan as a former angel, see also\nthe Latin recension of the Life of Adam and Eve (§§ 12–13, 15; Charlesworth 1985, 262, and Anderson and Stone\n1994, 10–12).\n456 shayṭān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Still, it bears underlining\nthat the Qur’anic jinn remain overall much more neutral than Satan’s demonic minions\nin the Christian tradition: rather than having made a primordial choice against God as a\nresult of which they are irrevocably embroiled in evil, the jinn occupy a morally ambiguous\nzone, enabling at least some of them to become believers (see under → jinn).\nThe dev il’s “authority” (sulṭān). Subsequent to his expulsion from the comp any of God\nand the angels, God grants Iblīs respite from damnation and Iblīs announces that he w ill\nseek to seduce (aghwā)20 and waylay as many humans as he can; those who succumb to\nhim will be doomed to hell (Q 7:14–18, 15:36–43, 17:62–65, 38:79–85). By contrast, God’s\ntrue or “elect” (mukhlaṣ)21 “servants” are exempted from such diabolical temptation (Q 15:40,\n38:83), and the devil is said to have no “authority” (→ sulṭān) over them (Q 15:42, 17:65).\nSuch statements are reminiscent of the declaration in Col 1:13 that God “has rescued us\nfrom the authority (ek tēs exousias, Peshitta: men shūlṭāneh) of darkness and transferred us\ninto the kingdom of his beloved son,” illustrating the general conceptual continuity that\nobtains between Qur’anic sulṭān and New Testamental exousia.22 The exemption from the\ndev il’s authority that the Qur’an promises to God’s servants could be taken to mean that\nsome h umans enjoy special divine protection against temptation, as illustrated by Q 12:24,\nwhere God “turns away” (ṣarafa; see CDKA 160–161) evil from Joseph, thus fortifying him\nto resist being seduced by the wife of his Egyptian master (see also Q 12:33–34). Yet God’s\n18 Even more supportive of such an understanding is the edited text of the so- called Eastern manuscript\ngroup of the Cave of Trea sures, which sets the scene for Satan’s fall by narrating how Adam was envied by the\n“rebellious order” (haw tegmā mārodā), who are glossed as “one of the o rders of spiritual beings” (Ri 1987, East-\nern manuscript group, ch. 3:1). This phrasing allows for the understanding that the future Satan belonged to a\nclass of spiritual beings who w ere dif er ent in nature from the angels rather than just forming a special subclass\nof them. Tesei also points out that a later passage in the Cave of Trea sures contrasts the saintly descendants of\nSeth with “the order of demons who fell from heaven” (Ri 1987, ch. 7:4; Tesei 2016, 76). The statement could be\nconstrued to mean that the “lower order” was non- angelic or demonic to begin with. However, it is equally pos-\nsi ble to interpret the phrase in the sense of “the beings who fell from heaven and as a result turned into demons.”\n19 Tesei suggests that the Qur’anic Iblīs/Satan has a “twofold angelic and demoniac nature,” i.e., that he is\nboth a demon and an angel (Tesei 2016, 76).\n20 The verb aghwā also occurs in a poem on the creation of the world by ʿAdī ibn Zayd (al- Muʿaybid 1965,\nno. 103:14), in a retrospective description of Adam and Eve’s seduction by the serpent.\n21 On akhlaṣa, see CDKA 89. Akhlaṣa dīnahu/al- dīna li- llāhi is “to restrict (one’s) religious worship or alle-\ngiance exclusively to God” (e.g., Q 4:146; → dīn2). The passive participle mukhlaṣ, which almost always functions\nas an attribute of God’s servants (Q 12:24, 15:40, 37:40.74.128.160.169, 38:83; but see 19:51) would seem to mean\n“singled out, elect.” Hence, the transitive verb akhlaṣa may be generally parsed as meaning “to single out s.th. or\ns.o.,” a meaning that is clear in Q 38:46 (innā akhlaṣnāhum bi- khāliṣatin dhikrā l- dār, “We singled them out with\na special quality, [namely,] exhortation about the [final] abode”; cf. CDKA 104).\n22 On the authority of the devil, see also Acts 26:18.

What ever assistance against temptation God\nafords him, therefore, is predicated on Joseph’s own determination to resist temptation.\nSimilarly, when it is said that God’s true or “elect” are exempt from the dev il’s authority,\nthis likely presupposes significant moral efort on the latter’s part to withstand the dev il’s\nendeavours to sway them, even if such moral efort can perhaps be supplemented by some\nsort of divine fortification.\nThis interpretation is corroborated by comments on the issue of the dev il’s authority\nover humans that occur outside the Qur’anic retellings of the fall of Iblīs. According to\nQ 16:99–100, the devil has no authority over those who believe and who entrust them-\nselves to God; rather, the dev il’s authority only extends to those who “take him as an ally”\n(tawallā + acc.) and who are guilty of associationism or shirk. This is only superficially\ncontradicted by Q 14:22, where the devil delivers an eschatological address to the sinners\nin which he denies possessing any real “authority” (sulṭān) over anyone: “I did not have any\nauthority over youp; it was only that I called you and you responded to me” (wa- mā kāna\nliya ʿalaykum min sulṭānin illā an daʿawtukum fa- stajabtum lī; see also Q 34:20–21). The\ncommon assumption under lying Q 14:22 and 16:99–100 is clearly that Satan or the devil\nonly acquires “authority” over a person if this person willingly cedes it, by “responding\nto” the devil or by “taking him as an ally.” Unlike the famous exchange between God and\nSatan in Job 1, where Satan is given permission to destroy all of Job’s possessions with a\nview to ascertaining the sincerity of his commitment to God (Job 1:10–12), it is therefore\nnot clear that the Qur’anic devil secures any real concession from God at all in passages like\nQ 17:62–65: since putting h umans to the test is said to be the ultimate purpose for which\nGod has created the world (Q 11:7; → balā), the dev il’s moral assaults on Adam and his\ndescendants merely serve God’s prior objective. Similarly, when Job laments to God that\n“Satan has touched me with hardship and torment” (Q 38:41: annī massaniya l- shayṭānu\nbi-n uṣbin wa- ʿadhāb), which the Qur’an seems to accept as an accurate description of\nJob’s situation, this presupposes that Satan can deploy adversity and misfortune in order\nto lure humans away from God; but elsewhere it is made clear that God himself may test\nhumans by subjecting them to sufering and misfortune (e.g., Q 21:35: nablūkum bi- l- sharri\nwa- l- khayri fitnatan; see under → balā). Once more, Satan appears to be merely an agent\nor instrument serving God’s ultimate purpose.\nThe Qur’anic retellings of the dialogue between God and Iblīs, which may be described\nas a primordial divine licensing of the dev il’s role as humanity’s tempter, therefore under-\nscore that the devil is far from a genuine opponent of God: rather than frustrating God’s\ndesign, he plays a well- defined role in it (Pohlmann 2012, 119–120; Tesei 2016, 71–73; HCI\n147–148). Q 59:16 goes so far as to portray how Satan disowns his victims and professes\nhis own fear of God, though the verb used is khāfa and not → ittaqā (which would carry\nimplications of practical righ teousness): “I am quit of you; I am afraid of God, the Lord\nof the world- dwellers.”\nIt is above all in this function as a divinely licensed tempter that the devil is pre sent in\nthe later Meccan and Medinan surahs, which warn the believers not to “follow the foot-\nsteps of the devil” (Q 2:168.208, 6:142, 24:21: lā tattabiʿū khuṭuwāti l-s hayṭāni; see also\nunder → tabiʿa) and remind them that the devil is humankind’s “clear e nemy” (ʿaduww\nmubīn; see Q 2:36.168.208, 6:142, 7:22, 12:5, 17:53, 28:15, 35:6, 36:60, 43:62).

Rather, h umans must above all beware of the machinations of one par tic ul ar jinni, the\narch- tempter Satan or “the devil” par excellence; although his activity as a tempter accords\nwith God’s overarching cosmic objective of moral discrimination, Satan’s backstory makes\nhim a remorseless foe of humankind who is intent on dragging as many h umans with him to\nhell as he can contrive (e.g., Q 2:268, 3:155, 4:38.60.76.83.117–121, 5:90–91, 8:11.48, 58:10.19,\n59:16; on the dev il’s activity as a tempter and seducer, see in more detail DTEK 64–72).\nIndeed, it is precisely because of his personal backstory and the rancour engendered by it\nthat the devil is able to function so efficiently as God’s agent of temptation.\n“The devil” (al- shayṭān) and “the dev ils” (al- shayāṭīn). As just intimated, both “the\ndevil” or Satan (al- shayṭān) and “the dev ils” (al- shayāṭīn) function as sources of temptation,\nand their activity is sometimes described in similar terms. Thus, a string of verses describes\nthe dev il’s activity with the verb zayyana + acc. li-, “to make s.th. appear fair, alluring, or\ndesirable to s.o.” (Q 6:43, 8:48, 15:39, 16:63, 27:24, 29:38), and in Q 41:25 the grammatical\nsubject of zayyana consists in the companion demons (qur anāʾ), whom Q 43:36 identifies\nas recruited from among the dev ils (see also the occurrence of zayyana in Q 6:137).23 More-\nover, both “the devil” and “the dev ils” are linked with the attribute → rajīm, “deserving to be\npelted” (cf. Q 3:36, 15:34, 16:98, 38:77 with 15:17, 81:25). Fin ally, the way in which the devil\nwill ultimately disown t hose who have followed him and shift the blame for their misdeeds\nback onto them (Q 14:22) bears a general resemblance to the way in which the companion\ndemons are described as d oing the same (Q 50:27).\nGiven such parallels and the evident fact that al-s hayāṭīn is the plural of al-s hayṭān,\nrecipients of the Qur’an would likely have inferred that the devil is in some sense to be\nenvisaged as the chief of the evil demons, conforming to late antique pre ced ent. Nonethe-\nless, the precise relationship between the devil and other demons remains largely implicit\nin the Qur’an (DTEK 62). One verse mentions Iblīs’s “ofspring” (dhurriyyah, Q 18:50),\nraising the possibility that the descendants in question are to be identified with wicked\ndemons, and Q 26:95 speaks of the “hosts (junūd) of Iblīs” being cast into hell.24 Especially\nsince these hosts are mentioned in addition to “t hose who have gone astray” (al- ghāwūn),\nwho would seem to refer to h uman sinners, the “hosts of Iblīs” are prob ably to be under-\nstood as the latter’s demonic minions. Yet the Qur’an never explic itly confirms that Iblīs\nwas expelled together with an entire group of subordinates, as narrated, for instance, in\nthe Cave of Trea sures (Ri 1987, ch. 3:4); and the Qur’anic devil is generally represented as\noperating in an individual capacity rather than as the head of an array of subordinates. It\nis pos si ble that this lack of an explicit connection between Iblīs or the devil as a narrative\nprotagonist, on the one hand, and the shayāṭīn as wicked demons, on the other, reflects\nthe fact that both terms w ere at home in dif er ent strands of ancient Arabian discourse:\nthe former in Christian narratives around the figure of a fallen member of God’s heavenly\nentourage who is identical with the heavenly “accuser” or “adversary” (haśśāṭān) of the\n23 The verb can also take God as its subject (Q 6:108, 27:4), highlighting that the temptations originating\nfrom Satan and companion demons are all parts of God’s ultimate purpose of subjecting h umans to t rials in order\nto ascertain their moral merit (→ balā).

In concluding this overview of Qur’anic statements\nabout the dev ils and dev ilish demons, some comments on the putative history and usage\nof the word shayṭān prior to the Qur’an are in order, even though the topic permits little\nmore than speculation. The Qur’anic al-s hayṭān is usually taken to have its immediate\norigin in Classical Ethiopic sayṭān, “Satan” (RAH 232, n. 1; NB 47; Rudolph 1922, 34–35;\nKU 120–121; see also Leslau 1991, 522–523). Yet the reverse etymological relationship has\nalso been maintained, with shayṭān being a native Arabic word that was subsequently\nloaned into Ethiopic (Praetorius 1907, 619–620). Aspects of this latter account, long\nsidelined as a result of Nöldeke’s rejection, have recently been championed and further\ndeveloped by Mark Durie (Durie 2018, 182–195). Durie maintains that the indigenous\nArabic word shayṭān, originally referring to the Arabian horned viper, was secondarily\nenlisted, in a case of “phono- semantic matching,” as the Arabic name of the Biblical Satan,\nwhom Jewish and Christian texts designated by the phonetically similar words haśśāṭān\n(Biblical Hebrew), śaṭan (rabbinic Hebrew), ho satanas (Greek), or sāṭānā (Syriac).25\nKropp, too, assumes that there was an indigenous Arabic word shayṭān, which he holds\nto have subsequently blended with a designation for the Biblical Satan loaned from Old\nEthiopic (Kropp 2007, especially 339); unlike Durie he does not think that the diphthong\n-a y- in Ethiopic sayṭān is linguistically inexplicable unless assumed to derive from Arabic\nshayṭān (cf. Durie 2018, 191, and Kropp 2007, 335–336 and 338–339).\nIn deciding between t hese conflicting theories, it would be crucial to know w hether it\nis indeed the case, as asserted by Muslim scholars and lexicographers reaching back at least\nas far as al- Jāḥiẓ, that shayṭān can mean “snake” or a certain species thereof (AEL 1552; e.g.,\nFVQ 188 and Durie 2018, 186; see also Radscheit 2010, 111). The textual evidence for this\ncontention is not exactly compelling, since one of the two verses that Jefery cites in sup-\nport of shayṭān signifying “snake”—a ttributed to Ṭarafah and g oing back to al- Jāḥiẓ’s Kitāb\nal-ḥ ayawān (al- Jāḥiẓ 1965, 1:153.300, 4:133, 6:192; see already van Vloten 1893, 175)—is not\nfound in the poet’s dīwān. Nonetheless, at least the weaker claim that shayṭān was already\npart of the Arabic language before the Qur’an can be accepted with a sufficient degree of\nconfidence. The word occurs in a two- verse fragment of poetry that al- Jāḥiẓ attributes to\nAws ibn Ḥajar (Geyer 1892, no. 44:2), accusing a woman of having al- shayṭān “perched\non the back of her neck” (idhā l-s hayṭānu qaṣṣaʿa fī qafāhā),26 and a similar reference\nto al-s hayṭān is found in a poem that the Mufaḍḍaliyyāt assign to the mukhaḍram poet\nal- Muzarrid (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 17:68).27 A couplet ascribed to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt\n(Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:27–28 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:27–28), moreover, speaks of shayāṭīn,\n“dev ils,” who are repelled from heaven by means of shooting stars; although these verses\n25 A third account is Puin’s proposal that the medial y of Arabic shayṭān, which on the face of it militates\nagainst direct derivation from Hebrew śāṭān or Syriac sāṭānā, is due to a misreading of the mater lectionis yāʾ,\nwhich occasionally represents the sound ā in early Qur’anic manuscripts (von Bothmer et al. 1999, 39–40; see\nalso the discussion in Reynolds 2010a, 57, n. 93).

Fi nally, shayṭān is credibly reported to have been a pre- Islamic\npersonal name (Goldziher 1891, 685, n. 2; Goldziher 1896, 106; KU 120).\nIn speculating on the semantic development of shayṭān in pre- Qur’anic Arabic, it is best\nto work backwards in time. A defensible starting point is to surmise that already prior to\nMuhammad’s preaching the word had come to signify a spirit or demon, perhaps a cunning\nor malicious one, seeing that this meaning is so clearly attested in the Qur’an. The reported\nuse of shayṭān as a proper name could then be explained has having had a complimentary\nsense connoting possession of superhuman abilities, just as we might today describe some-\none as “fiendishly” cunning (see also van Vloten 1893, 176). Alternatively, the name shayṭān\nmay have been apotropaic, i.e., may exemplify the tendency to call c hildren by derogatory\nnames in order to protect them from malicious forces. In view of two Qur’anic verses\nsuggesting an affinity between snakes and the jinn (Q 27:10, 28:31; → jinn), there might,\nmoreover, have been a general cultural association in pre- Islamic Arabia between snakes\nand demons. This would be one way of making sense of al- Jāḥiz’s claim that shayṭān can\nmean “snake” in Arabic. (An alternative explanation, which I ultimately find more attrac-\ntive, is suggested below.)\nIt is striking, though, that the verse attributed to Aws ibn Ḥajar has al- shayṭān with the\ndefinite article, which does invite the translation “Satan” or “the devil.” How to account\nfor this? It is not implausible that pre- Qur’anic speakers of Arabic, especially Christian\nones, would have heard of the figure of a malevolent tempter and corrupter who was\ncalled, u nder the influence of Ethiopic sayṭān, “Satan” or al- shayṭān. In fact, one may even\ngo further and suppose that stories about the fall of al- shayṭān and his responsibility for\nseducing Adam and Eve had begun to circulate among Arabophone Christians prior to the\nQur’an, thus preparing the ground for Qur’anic narratives about this sequence of events.\nAdmittedly, I am unable to produce a pre- Qur’anic Arabic locus probans in which Adam\nand Eve’s seduction is blamed on the devil rather than just the serpent. Instead, a poetic\nretelling of the Biblical account of the creation of Adam that is attributed to the Christian\npoet ʿAdī ibn Zayd difers from the Qur’an by omitting any reference to Satan or the devil\nand only imputes the temptation of Adam and Eve to “the serpent” (al-ḥ ayyah), in faithful\ncorrespondence to Gen 3 (Toral- Niehof 2008, 249–251, and Dmitriev 2010, 366–367; see\nal- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 103:11–15).28 Nonetheless, the Christian tendency to link or conflate\nthe Biblical serpent from Gen 3 with Satan is well attested (e.g., Beck 1957a, On Paradise,\nno. 15:14; see also Ephrem 1955, 34 = Ephrem 1994, 107–108; see also Witztum 2011, 93).\nThis makes it fairly unproblematic to posit that there may have been pre- Qur’anic Arabic\nretellings of the fall of Adam and Eve that did feature Satan and not just the serpent—in\ncontrast to ʿAdī ibn Zayd, who may deliberately have confined himself to a relatively faithful\nversification of the Biblical text to the exclusion of extra-s criptural amplifications involving\nSatan (Toral-N iehof 2008, 252–255). Indeed, one could even suggest that the reported use\nof shayṭān to mean “snake” is best explained as a distant lexical reflection of the Christian\nconflation of the Biblical serpent with Satan.\n28 This noteworthy discrepancy constitutes an impor tant argument for the basic authenticity of ʿAdī ibn\nZayd’s text. A poetic fragment that is attributed, prob ably correctly, to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt similarly appears\nto presuppose that responsibility for the fall of Adam lies with the serpent (al-ḥ ayyah), though the passage is\nmore allusive than the ʿAdī ibn Zayd poem (Schulthess 1911a, no. 28:6–7 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 69:6–7; see Seiden-\nsticker 2011b, 49–50).\nshayṭān 461", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, the most compre-\nhensive Qur’anic cata logue of religious communities in Q 22:17 lists alladhīna āmanū = the\nQur’anic “believers” (→ āmana), alladhīna hādū = the Jews, al-n aṣārā = the Christians,\nal- majūs = the “Magians” or Zoroastrians, and alladhīna ashrakū = the pagan “associators”\n(see under → ashraka).

In ancient Arabic poetry, the virtue of steadfast-\nness (ṣabr) is the poet-h ero’s ability to restrain (ṣabara) his vital self (nafs) and unflinch-\ningly to face the manifold dangers and hardships to which he must expose himself (see the\nmaterial discussed u nder → nafs; for a further verse boasting of steadfastness in battle, see\nLyall 1918–1924, no. 106:6). Qur’anic residues of this general link between the virtue of\nsteadfastness and mastery of the vital self or nafs consist in Q 18:28, where the noun nafs\nis the direct object of transitive ṣabara, similar to some poetic verses, and 12:18.83, where\nJacob recommends steadfastness as the way to overcome the persuasive promptings (verb:\nsawwala) of one’s nafs. Nonetheless, the Meccan surahs exhibit a significant conceptual\nreconfiguration of the virtue of steadfastness in line with their general emphasis that the\nbelievers must patiently await God’s judgement. The Medinan surahs subsequently enrich\nthis largely passive Meccan concept of forbearance with more activist aspects.\nSteadfastness in the Meccan Qur’an. The Meccan surahs transform the heroic virtue\nof steadfast self- restraint in the face of peril and hardship that is seen in poetry into a\npatient awaiting of God’s retributive intervention in the face of adversity and rejection.\nFor example, the early Meccan verses Q 52:48 and 68:48 as well as the slightly l ater verse\n76:24 demand that the Messenger “steadfastly await the judgement of yourS Lord” (wa-\nṣbir/fa- ṣbir li- ḥukmi rabbika; see also the early Meccan exhortations to steadfastness in\nQ 70:5 and 74:7), and according to Q 20:130, 38:17, 50:39, and 73:10 the Messenger must\n“steadfastly endure what they”— namely, his opponents— “say” (fa- ṣbir/wa- ṣbir ʿalā mā\nyaqūlūna). Other types of adversity, too, ought to be endured patiently (e.g., Q 31:17) and\nindeed unquestioningly, as exemplified by the paradigmatic figure of Job (Q 21:83–84,\n38:41–44; see Alexander 2006, 380–381 and also u nder → ẓalama). Hardship and misfor-\ntune are, a fter all, an impor tant means by which God ascertains the moral merit of h umans\n(see u nder → balā). In return for exhibiting such patience, the believers are promised\neschatological reward “ because they were steadfast” (Q 76:12: wa- jazāhum bi- mā ṣabarū\njannatan wa- ḥarīrā; cf. the use of bi-m ā ṣabarū in 7:137, 23:111, 25:75, 28:54). From the\nability to exercise self- restraint in the interest of embarking on and persevering in heroic\naction, the virtue of ṣabara is thus remoulded into passive forbearance and patient en-\ndurance towards an eschatological vanis hing point. Decisive action is not the preserve\nof humans but of God.

Unlike Job, whom God\nfound to be “steadfast” (Q 38:44), Moses’s aspiration to prove himself steadfast (Q 18:69)\nfails due to his inability to refrain from passing judgement on his companion’s actions,\ndespite the fact that the latter is expressly introduced as participating in God’s mercy\nand knowledge (Q 18:65). The passage may be considered a negative counterpart to the\nQur’anic portrayal of Job and like it confirms that steadfastness is not l imited to the mere\nendurance of outward adversity; it also involves an inner attitude of trust in God and the\nability to desist from questioning and doubting the creator’s mercy and wisdom even when\nfaced with seemingly contrary experiences. Steadfastness or ṣabr thus includes the ability\nto withstand and brace oneself against cognitive dissonance. The fact that the Qur’anic\nunderstanding of steadfastness encompasses this aspect of inner trust also illuminates why\nthe Meccan verse Q 29:59 couples the concept of steadfastness with that of total reliance\n(verb: tawakkala) upon God, by referring to “ those who are steadfast and who rely upon\ntheir Lord” (alladhīna ṣabarū wa-ʿ alā rabbihim yatawakkalūn; cf. Q 16:42).2\nSteadfastness in the Medinan Qur’an. The Meccan notion of steadfastness or ṣabr,\nwhich is largely passive, undergoes a certain shift back to activism in Medinan passages.\nSome of them combine the virtue of steadfastness with references to “contending”\n(verb: → jāhada; see Q 3:142, 16:110, 47:31),3 which in the Medinan surahs becomes a\nbyword for militancy. A number of additional Medinan verses reference the virtue of\nsteadfastness in contexts that are clearly martial (Q 2:249–250, 3:125.146, 8:65). This shift\nconsorts with the general transition from passivism to activism that marks the progression\nfrom the Meccan to the Medinan surahs (→ jāhada). Nonetheless, the development just\nsketched by no means amounts to a complete reconstruction of the concept of steadfast-\nness, since there is a substantial number of Medinan verses in which derivatives of ṣ- b- r\ncontinue to function in broad accordance with their Meccan usage (e.g., Q 2:45.177, 3:17,\n22:35, 33:35). A good illustration of the way in which both aspects of the virtue of stead-\nfastness are synthetically integrated is Q 2:153–157. The passage begins by charging the\nbelievers to have recourse to steadfastness and prayer (v. 153), then admonishes them not\nto deem those killed on God’s path dead (v. 154), and subsequently broadens out into the\ngeneral affirmation that God w ill test (→ balā) the Qur’anic community with experiences\nof “fear” and “hunger” and with “loss of possessions and lives and crops,” upon which the\nMessenger is commanded to “give good tidings to those who are steadfast” (v. 155), that\n1 For Meccan passages in which the command to exhibit steadfastness is addressed to a collective (fa-ṣ birū/\nwa-ṣ birū), see Q 7:87 (where the speaker is Shuʿayb, who is preaching to his people) and 7:128 (Moses to his\npeople).\n2 Q 16:41–42 are almost certainly a Medinan insertion; see GQ 1:145–146 and Neuwirth 2007, 300.\n3 Q 16:110 is Medinan despite occurring in a mostly Meccan surah (see again GQ 1:145–146 and Neuwirth\n2007, 301).\nṣabara 465", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In the first place, the breast is associ-\nated with emotions of distress and anguish (AHW 122–123). Apart from Q 59:13, locating\nthe fear (rahbah) of the believers’ opponents in their breasts, three verses combine the\nnoun ṣadr with derivatives of the root ḍ- y- q, yielding the notion of a “straitening,” “tight-\nening,” or “narrowing” of the breast (Q 11:12, 15:97, 26:13; see also 6:125 and 7:2; 4:90\nhas ḥaṣira instead of ḍāqa).1 The same collocation ṣadr + ḍāqa, “to become straitened\nor tightened,” is also attested in poetry (e.g., al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 16:35, cited in AHW\n118). The opposite sensation to a tightening of the chest is its “widening” or “opening.”\nIn two scriptural verses, this would seem to be a divinely granted sense of relief and en-\ncouragement (Q 20:25, 94:1); by contrast, when Q 6:125 and 39:22 expand the phrase\nsharaḥa ṣadrahu by the prepositional syntagm li- l- islām, the resulting locution “to open up\ns.o.’s breast to self- surrender” is efectively a synonym for the bestowal of divine guidance\n(→ aslama, → hadā).2 The Qur’an also depicts the breast as the seat of hate and rancour\n1 The noun ḍayq, “tightness, narrowness,” in Q 16:127 and 27:70 would appear to be synonymous, even\nthough it is not explic itly linked with the breast.

The breast, however, can on oc-\ncasion function as a substitute for e ither of them.3 Thus, God knows (ʿalima) what is in\npeople’s hearts (Q 4:63, 8:70, 33:51, 48:18; see also 2:204, 8:24, and 9:64; → qalb), just as\nhe knows what is in their souls (anfus, nufūs; Q 2:235, 11:31, 17:25; see also 2:284 and 5:116)\nor breasts (ṣudūr; e.g., Q 3:29.119.154, 5:7, 8:43, 11:5, 27:74, 29:10). The rationale b ehind\nevoking the breast as a stand-in for the heart is made explicit in Q 22:46, speaking of “the\nhearts that are in the breasts” (al- qulūb allatī fī l- ṣudūr), while at the end of Q 3:154, the\nphrases mā fī ṣudūrikum (“what is in your breasts”) and mā fī qulūbikum (“what is in your\nhearts”) would seem to form a bipartite pleonasm, confirming the impression that the\nbreast and the heart can be evoked interchangeably. This, too, has prec e dent in poetry\n(Lyall 1918–1924, no. 27:13.15, where fuʾād and ṣudūr function as synonyms). As we saw\nabove, God is sometimes described as directly acting upon a h uman’s breast by “widening”\nit or “opening it up”; a similar theme of direct divine action on the inner states of a person\nis also found with regard to the heart (→ qalb). As regards the breast and the soul, vario us\nQur’anic expressions appear in connection with both ṣadr and nafs. Q 12:67 speaks of a\n“feeling of need in Jacob’s soul that he satisfied” (ḥājatan fī nafsi yaʿqūba qaḍāhā), while\n40:80 and 59:9 locate feelings of need (ḥājah) in people’s “breasts” (ṣudūr; see AHW 125;\ncf. also AHW 120). Moreover, humans may conceal (akhfā, asarra, akanna) the contents\nof their souls (akhfā: Q 2:284, 3:154, 33:37; asarra: 5:52, 12:77; akanna: 2:235) and of their\nbreasts (akhfā: Q 3:29.118 and 40:19;4 asarra: 11:5, 64:4, 67:13; akanna: 27:74, 28:69).\nFi nally, just as the breast may experience straitening or narrowing (ḍ- y- q; see above), so\nmay the soul (Q 9:118).\nṣadaqa ditr. | to be sincere to s.o. in s.th., to fulfil s.th. to s.o.\n→ ṣaddaqa\nṣaddaqa intr. bi- | to hold s.th. true, to declare s.th. to be true,\nto believe in s.th.\nṣaddaqa intr. | to be a believer\nṣaddaqa tr. | to fulfil s.th., to make s.th. come true; to confirm or\ncorroborate s.th. or s.o.\nmuṣaddiq | confirming\ntaṣdīq | confirmation\nFurther vocabulary discussed: kadhdhaba intr. bi- | to dismiss s.th. as a lie āmana\nintr. bi- | t o believe in s.th. k itāb | scripture n azzala, anzala tr. | t o send s.th. down,\nto bring s.th. down a l- tawrāh | the Torah m uhaymin (or muhayman) ʿ alā | e ntrusted\n3 I am grateful to Ohad Kayam for alerting me to some of the phraseological parallelisms between the breast\nand the soul that are noted in what follows.\n4 See also Q 11:5, which has another derivative of kh- f- y, istakhfā.\nṣaddaqa 467", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The fifth- form verb taṣaddaqa, “to be charitable, to make\ngifts of charity,” is treated under → ṣadaqah.\nUse in the Meccan Qur’an. Ṣaddaqa bi- is the antonym of → kadhdhaba bi-, “to dismiss\ns.th. as a lie” (see Q 75:31–32, 92:6.9). In the early Meccan surahs, ṣaddaqa bi- (Q 70:26,\n92:6) plays the same semantic role that subsequently devolves on → āmana bi-, “to believe\nin s.th.,” and the early Meccan Qur’an also attests to a corresponding absolute employ-\nment of ṣaddaqa without accusative object, “to be a believer” (Q 37:52, 75:31, 56:57; CQ\n59; Ahrens 1935, 110–111; Ringgren 1951, 10–11). Isolated occurrences of ṣaddaqa bi- , “to\nhold s.th. true, to declare s.th. to be true,” persist as late as Q 66:12 (see also 39:33). At the\nsame time, as noted by Ringgren, in l ater Meccan and Medinan surahs ṣaddaqa is generally\nused with a direct object to signify “to confirm s.th. or s.o.” Thus, Moses asks God to let\nhis brother Aaron accompany him, “as a support and to confirm me” (Q 28:34: fa- arsilhu\nmaʿiya ridʾan yuṣaddiqunī). Although t here is one case in which ṣaddaqa + acc. must mean\n“to fulfil s.th., to make s.th. come true” (Q 37:105: Abraham is praised for having fulfilled\nthe dream in which God commanded him to sacrifice his son; see CDKA 159), the domi-\nnant use of ṣaddaqa and especially its active participle muṣaddiq in later Meccan surahs is\nto articulate the Qur’anic proclamations’ confirmatory relationship to prior revelations.\nThis notion is already expressed in an early Meccan verse, Q 37:37, according to which\nMuhammad “brings the truth and confirms the [ earlier] messengers” (jāʾa bi- l- ḥaqqi wa-\nṣaddaqa l- mursalīn). In l ater Meccan passages, the Qur’anic revelations are described as a\n“scripture” that was “sent down after Moses” and “confirms what precedes it” (Q 46:30:\nkitāban unzila min baʿdi mūsā muṣaddiqan li- mā bayna yadayhi; see also 6:92, 35:31, 46:12)\nor as a “confirmation of what precedes it” (Q 10:37, 12:111: taṣdīq allādhī bayna yadayhi).\nEspecially Q 6:91–92 and 46:12.30 make it clear that the scripture confirmed by the Qur’an\nis specifically the Mosaic scripture.\nMedinan developments. The participle muṣaddiq is even more frequent in a number\nof Medinan surahs, generally in the context of anti- Jewish polemics. Thus, the divine\nvoice exhorts the Israelites and “ those who were given the scripture” to “believe in what\nI/we have sent down confirming what is with youp” (Q 2:41, 4:47: mā anzaltu/nazzalnā\nmuṣaddiqan li- mā maʿakum; → nazzala), and God is said to have obliged “the prophets”\nto believe in a subsequent “messenger who confirms what is with youp” (Q 3:81: rasūlun\nmuṣaddiqun li-m ā maʿakum; see similarly 2:101), this messenger evidently being Mu-\nhammad. Other verses reiterate that the Qur’anic revelations do in fact “confirm what is\nwith” the Israelites (Q 2:89.91), and the older Meccan phrase “confirming what precedes\nit” also recurs (Q 2:97, 3:3, 5:48). Similar to Muhammad, Jesus too is said to have come\nto “confirm what precedes me/him of the Torah” (Q 3:50, 5:46, 61:6: muṣaddiqan li- mā\nbayna yadayya/yadayhi mina l-t awrāti). But Jesus also “permitted some of the t hings that\nhad been prohibited” to the Israelites (Q 3:50: wa-l i-u ḥilla lakum baʿḍa lladhī ḥurrima\nʿalaykum). This suggests that confirmation is not to be confused with mere reiteration but\nmay involve a degree of authoritative modification and rectification.\n468 ṣaddaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:491", "title": "Page 491", "locator": "pdf_page:491", "text": "Other Qur’anic verses point in the same direction. Q 5:48 declares not only that what\nis being revealed to Muhammad “confirms what precedes it of the [celestial] scripture”\n(muṣaddiqan li-m ā bayna yadayhi mina l-k itābi; → kitāb), but also that it is muhayminan\n(or, according to a variant reading, muhaymanan) ʿalayhi, which is plausibly read as mean-\ning “entrusted with authority over it,” i.e., forming an unimpeachable standard for the\nvalidity of statements about the content and meaning of prior revelations (→ muhaymin).\nThis reading of Q 5:48 coheres well with the fact that the Medinan surahs undeniably claim\nthe authority to determine what the revelatory deposit of Jews and Christians actually\nmeans and consists in. This is exemplified by accusations that the Jews or Israelites “shift\n(yuḥarrifūna) words from their places” (Q 4:46, 5:13.41: yuḥarrifūna l- kalima ʿan / min\nbaʿdi mawāḍiʿihi; cf. 2:75; see Reynolds 2010b, 193–195, and CDKA 291), “conceal” parts\nof the truth revealed to them (e.g., Q 2:42.140.146, 3:71; cf. also 3:187, 5:15, 6:911), and\nmisattribute human compositions or utterances to God (Q 2:79, 3:78; for a detailed study\nof these motifs, see Reynolds 2010b). The Qur’anic proclamations style themselves as the\ndecisive corrective against such inaccurate citation and interpretation of God’s revelations:\n“O scripture- owners, our Messenger has come to you, making clear (→ bayyana) to you\nmuch of what you have been hiding of the scripture” (Q 5:15: yā- ahla l- kitābi qad jāʾakum\nrasūlunā yubayyinu lakum kathīran mimmā kuntum tukhfūna mina l- kitābi; cf. similarly\n5:19). In sum, the Qur’anic claim to a confirmatory relationship with previous scriptures is\ncoupled with a claim to constituting the ultimate arbiter, vis-à - vis Jews and Christians, of\nwhat these previous scriptures are saying. This is in fact not surprising, since the Meccan\nverse Q 27:76 already voices a kindred claim, albeit without an overt reference to e arlier\nscriptures: “this → qurʾān recounts to the Israelites (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl) most of that about\nwhich they are in disagreement (verb: ikhtalafa).”\nConfirmation and fulfilment. Qur’anic claims to “confirm” previous scriptures recall\nthe New Testamental notion that Jesus “fulfils” (plēroō, Peshitta: mallī) “the law and the\nprophets” (Matt 5:17; see also Matt 1:22, 2:15.17.23 etc.). Seeing that the Qur’an holds\nMuhammad’s appearance to have been foretold by the Torah and the Gospel (Q 7:157 and\n48:29, on which see u nder → ummī and → injīl) as well as by Abraham and Jesus personally\n(Q 2:129.151, 61:6), should the Qur’anic concept of confirmation, expressed by the verb\nṣaddaqa, perhaps be deemed to be more or less equivalent to the New Testamental idea\nof fulfilment, i.e., to convey the claim that Muhammad’s advent realises an outstanding\ndivine promise enshrined in previous scriptures? A fter all, Q 37:105 employs ṣaddaqa in\norder to describe Abraham’s fulfilment of a dream vision, and a number of additional verses\nhave the first- form verb ṣadaqa followed by two accusatives in the similar sense of “to be\nsincere to s.o. in s.th.” or “to fulfil s.th. to s.o.” (Q 3:152, 21:9, 39:74, 48:27; see CDKA 159).\nHowever, as we saw above, the contention that Muhammad “confirms” previous messen-\ngers appears as early as the early Meccan verse Q 37:37, whereas explicit assertions to the\nefect that Muhammad’s appearance is predicted in previous scriptures or by his precursors\nAbraham and Jesus are all Medinan. Hence, at least for the Meccan data reviewed above\nthe idea of confirmation may be assumed to focus more narrowly on the assumed identity\nof the Qur’an’s message with that of earlier revelations rather than on the contention that\nMuhammad fulfils earlier scriptural prophecies. To paraphrase Q 37:37, it is because\nMuhammad “brings the truth” that he “confirms” previous messengers (jāʾa bi- l- ḥaqqi\n1 On this verse, see the excursus under → ashraka.\nṣaddaqa 469", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In both Meccan\nand Medinan surahs, there are frequent injunctions to “give the → zakāh” and to “spend”\n(→ anfaqa) from what God has “provided” (→ razaqa) for the addressees (e.g., Q 2:3.254,\n4:39, 8:3, 13:22, 14:31). Specifically the Medinan surahs also utilise the noun ṣadaqah or its\nplural ṣadaqāt (Q 2:196.263.264.271.276, 4:114, 9:58.60.79.103.104, 58:12.13). That all three\nmanners of expression refer to the same broad practice of charitable giving is supported\nby their co- occurrence in some Medinan passages: thus, Q 2:261–281 and 63:10 employ\nthe noun ṣadaqah or the verb taṣaddaqa and mention the “spending” of property, while\n2:276–277 and 58:13 refer to charitable gifts (ṣadaqāt) and the giving of zakāh. As a result\nof such entwinement, it is not feasible to treat Qur’anic statements about zakāh, ṣadaqah,\nor charitable “spending” in neat separation, occasioning some overlap and cross- references\nbetween the pre sent entry and those on → ṣadaqah and → anfaqa; all three are best read\ntogether.\nThe basic meaning and etymology of ṣadaqah and taṣaddaqa. Etymologically,\nṣadaqah goes back to Hebrew ṣәdāqâ (BEḲ 89; FVQ 194; Weir and Zysow 1995, 708–709),\nwhich originally meant “righ teousness” but came to be a standard term for charity or\nalmsgiving (see generally Anderson 2009, 141–142, and Gardner 2015, 26–32; for an illus-\ntration of its use with the latter acceptation, see m. Abot 5:13). Apart from occurrences of\nthe noun ṣadaqah, the Qur’an also contains a number of Medinan verses that have the verb\ntaṣaddaqa or a participle (Q 2:280, 4:92, 5:45, 9:75, 12:88, 33:35, 57:18, 63:10). Taṣaddaqa\nis generally construable as a denominal verb derived from ṣadaqah, “to practise charity,\nto be charitable,” though sometimes in the contextually specific application of waiving an\nexisting entitlement (namely, to an outstanding debt, as in Q 2:280, or to blood money\nor talion, as in 4:92 and 5:45; see Weir and Zysow 1995, 709). The only non- Medinan\noccurrence of the root ṣ- d- q in relation to charity (as opposed to truth or truthfulness) is\nQ 12:88, where Joseph is beseeched by his b rothers, “Be charitable to us; God recompenses\nthose who are charitable” (wa- taṣaddaq ʿalaynā inna llāha yajzī l- mutaṣaddiqīn). Given the\nHebrew etymology of ṣadaqah, one would assume the words ṣadaqah and taṣaddaqa to\nhave been introduced into Arabic by Jewish speakers of the language, although non- Jews\n470 taṣaddaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’an’s predominantly Medinan usage of\nṣadaqah and taṣaddaqa could reflect ongoing usage among the Jewish tribes inhabiting\nMedina. It is in any case likely that the two terms entered Arabic prior to the Qur’an (Weir\nand Zysow 1995, 709).\nṢadaqah vs zakāh. Phraseologically, zakāh and ṣadaqah behave very diferently.\nZakāh, when referring to almsgiving, is deployed in a highly formulaic manner, occurring\nalmost always as the object of ātā, “to give,” and in close proximity to exhortations to per-\nform prayer, al-ṣ alāh (see under → zakāh). Neither generalisation applies to the Qur’anic\nuse of ṣadaqah (even though it is once used with ātā, in Q 2:271; 58:12 has qaddama),\nwhich is deployed in a significantly less constrained fashion.1 For instance, verses using\nṣadaqah give detailed prescriptions for specific circumstances: Q 2:196 stipulates that the\ncompensation for premature shaving during the pilgrimage consists in a fast, a ṣadaqah,\nor a sacrifice; Q 9:103 instructs the Messenger to “take” a ṣadaqah from the possessions\nof those who have confessed misdeeds, so as to purify them thereby, and to pray for them\n(khudh min amwālihim ṣadaqatan tuṭahhiruhum wa-t uzakkīhim bihā wa-ṣ alli ʿalayhim;\nsee also under → tāba); and Q 58:12 urges the addressees to ofer up a ṣadaqah before\nprivate audiences with the Messenger. In contrast with zakāh, ṣadaqah in the singular\nnever appears with the Arabic definite article, which can convey a generic meaning, as\nwhen al- insān denotes h umans in general (e.g., Q 96:2.5.6, 99:3, or 100:6). This, together\nwith the fact that ṣadaqah, unlike zakāh, has a Qur’anically attested plural, indicates that\nṣadaqah designates an individual gift or act of charity whereas al- zakāh signifies the gen-\neral practice of almsgiving. The definite plural al- ṣadaqāt, however, as found in verses\nlike Q 2:271.276, 9:60, and elsewhere, would seem to communicate the same meaning of\nalmsgiving as a general and habitual practice that is expressed by al- zakāh. Thus, in Q 9:60,\nwhich enumerates the intended recipients and uses of “gifts of charity” (innamā l-ṣ adaqātu\nli- l- fuqarāʾi wa- l- masākīni . . . ; → zakāh), al-ṣ adaqāt seems broadly equivalent to al- zakāh\n(see, for instance, Jal. 702, on Q 9:60, where al-ṣ adaqāt is glossed as al- zakawāt). It may be\nsuggested that the principal reason why Q 9:60 begins, “The ṣadaqāt are for . . .” (innamā\nl- ṣadaqātu li- . . .) rather than “The zakāh is for . . .” (innamā l-z akātu li- . . .) resides in\nthe formulaic constraints that appear to govern the Qur’anic use of zakāh (namely, co-\noccurrence with ṣalāh and employment as the object of ātā, “to give”).\nIt seems clear, in any case, that one cannot, without further argument, proj ect onto\nthe Qur’an the developed legal distinction between ṣadaqah as voluntary alms and zakāh\nas an obligatory and precisely regulated alms tax (for an overview of the relevant later\ndoctrines, see Weir and Zysow 1995 and Zysow 2002).2 Some modern researchers have\nnonetheless held that the Qur’anic meaning of ṣadaqah is a voluntary donation, in contrast\nto the obligatory nature of the zakāh (e.g., BEḲ 89; Weir and Zysow 1995, 709). Others,\nhowever, have denied such a distinction between ṣadaqah and zakāh and maintained a\nbasic synonymity between the two terms in the Qur’an (Snouck Hurgronje 1957, 159–160;\nRudolph 1922, 61; Nanji 2001, 65). An impor tant prooftext here is Q 9:60, which declares\n“gifts of charity” (al-ṣ adaqāt) to have been ordained by God (farīḍatan mina llāhi), just\nas the Qur’anic rules of inheritance are labelled a farīḍah in Q 4:11 (see also 4:24).

Among the themes attaching to Qur’anic references\nto charitable donations is the condemnation of giving ostentatiously (Q 2:264, 4:38: riʾāʾa\nl- nāsi, “in order to be seen by people”) and a stress on the preferability of giving in secret\n(Q 2:271). Th ese injunctions resemble a demand from the Sermon on the Mount (Matt\n6:1–4), and the rabbinic tradition also views ostentatious almsgiving with some reservation\n(Gardner 2015, 164–165). At the same time, it may be that the Qur’an is taking issue with\nthe ideal of ostentatious liberality and squandering that is upheld in pre- Islamic poetry\nand is reconfiguring it into a more restrained form of charity whose motive is gratitude\nfor God’s “provision” (rizq; → razaqa) rather than heroic self- aggrandisement (see, e.g.,\nERCQ 75–83 and u nder → khalada). While the Qur’anic proclamations unequivocally insist\non the need to give to others, this should not be done for show, and while the believers\nare told not to niggardly “keep yourS hand chained to your neck” (wa-l ā tajʿal yadaka\nmaghlūlatan ilā ʿunuqika), they are sim ult an eously discouraged from “opening it fully, lest\nyouS are forced to sit down blameworthy and impoverished” (wa- lā tabsuṭhā kulla l- basṭi\nfa- taqʿuda malūman maḥsūrā; Q 17:29). As an earlier verse in the same surah (Q 17:26)\nputs it, “give to relatives what they deserve and to the poor and to wayfarers; but do not\nsquander” (wa- āti dhā l-q urbā ḥaqqahu wa-l -m iskīna wa-b na l-s abīli wa-l ā tubadhdhir\ntabdhīrā; for another demand that the believers adopt a golden mean between prodigality\nand miserliness, see Q 25:67).4 Charitable gifts should also not be vitiated by extolling one’s\nown generosity and insulting the recipient (Q 2:263–264).\nAs Q 2:272 says, the charitable “spending” of money is ultimately spending on one’s\nown behalf (mā tunfiqū min khayrin fa- li- anfusikum), since such spending w ill be “repaid\nin full” (wa- mā tunfiqū min khayrin yuwaffa ilaykum; cf. also the announcement of reward\n3 Al- muṭṭawwiʿīna mina l- muʾminīna fī l- ṣadaqāti is rendered “believers who give alms of their own accord”\nin Weir and Zysow 1995, 709, but Paret makes a compelling argument that the prepositional phrase fī l- ṣadaqāti\ncomplements the verb yalmizūna, as it does in Q 9:58 rather than al- muṭṭawwiʿīn (KK 208). Regardless of which\nconstrual one adopts, however, Q 9:79 shows only that the Qur’an, unsurprisingly, has a concept of voluntary\ncharity, not that this is part of the core meaning of the concept of ṣadaqah. In support of the contention that the\nQur’an “does make a distinction between voluntary alms and zakāt,” Weir and Zysow 1995, 709, also adduce\nQ 2:177 and 58:13. According to Q 2:177, the defining features of right eous conduct (al- birr) include the giving\naway of property to relatives, orphans, the poor e tc. (wa- ātā l-m āla ʿalā ḥubbihi dhawī l-q urbā wa-l -y atāmā\nwa- l- masākīna wa- bna l- sabīli wa- l- sāʾilīna wa- fī l- riqābi) as well as the per for mance of prayer and the giving\nof zakāh; Q 58:13 first continues the point made in 58:12 that the hearers are to ofer a ṣadaqah in advance of\nprivate audiences with the Messenger and then urges t hose who have failed to live up to this demand yet have\nreceived divine forgiveness (wa- tāba llāhu ʿalaykum) to perform prayer and give zakāh. Th ere is certainly reason to\nconsider construing these two verses as presupposing a distinction between zakāh and another kind of charity;\nthis would readily account for the fact that Q 2:177, after having already referred to charitable giving, goes on to\nmention zakāh, while Q 58:13 switches from speaking of ṣadaqah to speaking of zakāh. However, an alternative\nexplanation consists in pointing to the formulaic concatenation of the phrases aqāma l- ṣalāh and ātā l- zakāh,\nalready highlighted above. Thus, the fact that Q 2:177 adds the latter to the former may simply reflect a widespread\nphraseological proclivity of the Qur’an rather than implying that the giving away of property to relatives and the\npoor etc. that is mentioned e arlier in the verse is dif ere nt from the zakāh. The same phraseological proclivity also\naccounts quite satisfactorily for the switch from ṣadaqah to zakāh in Q 58:13, which again occurs in the standing\nformula aqīmū l-ṣ alāta wa-ā tū l- zakāta.\n4 Q 17:26.29 and 25:67 are discussed in ERCQ 77–78.\n472 ṣadaqah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Unlike sabīl,\noccurrences of the word ṣirāṭ are almost exclusively meta phorical, with the exception of\nQ 7:86, where the messenger Shuʿayb exhorts his p eople not to “sit around on many a road\n(wa- lā taqʿudū bi- kulli ṣirāṭin), uttering threats and turning away from God’s path (sabīl)\nthose who believe in him.” Ṣirāṭ is ultimately descended from Latin (via) strata, prob ably\nthrough Greek and Aramaic (FVQ 195–196; CDKA 160; van Putten 2022, 124–125). It is there-\nfore arguable that ṣirāṭ connotes not just a path, like sabīl, but more specifically a Roman\nimperial road. This may well be the reason why ṣirāṭ is so frequently— namely, in 33 out of\na total of 45 verses—j oined with the adjective mustaqīm, “straight” (e.g., Q 1:6, 2:142.213,\n3:51.101, 4:68.175, 5:16, 36:4.61, 48:2.20, 67:22; see CQ 48), which is never the case for sabīl\n(although both God’s “path” and his “road” can be equally specified by the notion of even-\nness, expressed by the root s- w- y; → sabīl).1 Reflecting this, and in line with al- Zamaksharī’s\nelucidation of al-ṣ irāṭ as al- jāddah (Zam. 1:121), ṣirāṭ lends itself to being translated as “road,”\nin contrast with → sabīl, “path” (contrary to GMK 146 and Saleh 2010, 666).2\n5 See in par tic ul ar the distinction between “meritorious” and “atoning” almsgiving proposed in Downs 2016,\n6–11 (with the Qur’an ofering examples for both categories). Another relevant Qur’anic verse is Q 5:45, where\nthe charitable waiving of one’s entitlement to blood vengeance is described as an “act of atonement” (kaffārah;\nsee under → kaffara). Moreover, according to Q 2:196, a charitable gift, like fasting, may act as a fidyah, as a\n“ransom” or “redemption” (see also Q 2:184, where the same applies to the feeding of a poor, which is patently\na case of charity although not explic itly called thus).\n1 There is, however, one instance of ṭarīq + mustaqīm (Q 46:30).\n2 Saleh argues that ṣirāṭ denotes “not a straight path but a path, any path, and that is why the adjective\n‘straight’ is always added” (in line with Ṭab. 1:171).

The word ṣirāṭ thus drives home the\nidea that the divinely sanctioned course is clear for every one to see, or at least for t hose who\ncare to make the minimal efort of casting their eyes around. This diference is particularly\npalpable in Q 6:153, where the divine voice proclaims, “This is my road, straight (hādhā\nṣirāṭī mustaqīman). Followp it and do not follow [other] paths (al- subul), lest they cause you\nto scatter away from his [God’s] path (fa- tafarraqa bikum ʿan sabīlihi).” Accordingly, God’s\npath alone is a ṣirāṭ, distinguished from other paths by its conspicuousness and straightness.\nThis is confirmed by the fact that ṣirāṭ, when occurring in its usual meta phorical function,\nis always employed in a positive sense. As an exception, one might point to Q 37:23, where\nthe angels or minions of hell are commanded to “guide” the sinners to the “road of the\nblaze” or, as one might say, usher them forwards on the highway to hell (fa- hdūhum ilā\nṣirāṭi l- jaḥīm). But the verse’s employment of → hadā, “to guide,” which accompanies the\nnoun ṣirāṭ not only in Q 37:118 but also in many chronologically later passages (e.g., Q 1:6,\n2:142.213, 3:101, 4:68.175, 5:16, 6:87.161, 10:25, 16:121), is clearly a sardonic inversion of\nordinary usage, making it likely that the same applies to its use of ṣirāṭ. Thus, the Qur’an\ndoes not envisage that there could be an alternative to God’s “straight road” that is equally\ndeserving of being termed a ṣirāṭ.3 That the words ṣirāṭ and sabīl are not fully synonymous\nis moreover indicated by the fact that the root ḍ- l- l, signifying straying (→ ḍalla) or leading\nastray (aḍalla) from the divinely prescribed course, always collocates with the word sabīl\nas its prepositional object (e.g., Q 68:7: man ḍalla ʿan sabīlihi, “who strays from his [God’s]\npath”) and never with ṣirāṭ (see in more detail under → sabīl). By way of an explanation,\none may conjecture that the connotations that are putatively peculiar to ṣirāṭ— namely,\nbeing cons pic uo us, prominent, and difficult to overlook or miss— did not easily go together\nwith the meta phor of straying and losing one’s way.\nBiblical precursors. The Qur’an’s recurrent invocation of God’s “road” or “path” and\nits stress on the straightness of God’s road has impor tant Biblical, New Testamental, and\nrabbinic antecedents (on which see generally TDOT 3:270–293 and TDNT 5:42–114).\nThe general meta phor of “God’s path” is found, for instance, in the request to “teach me\nyour path (Hebrew: derek, Peshitta: ūrḥā), O Lord,” in Ps 27:11, in the call to “keep to” the\nLord’s “path” in Ps 37:34, or in the Pharisees’ admission that Jesus is teaching “the path\nof God” (hē hodos tou theou) in Matt 22:16 (Pohlmann 2018, 135, n. 614). As for the more\nspecific meta phor of the straightness of God’s path, it occurs in Biblical passages like Ps 5:9\n(“O Lord, guide me in your right eousness b ecause of my enemies; make your way straight\nbefore me”), Jer 31:9 (“I w ill lead them to brooks of w ater, on a straight path on which they\nshall not stumble”), and the famous pronouncement opening Deutero- Isaiah (Isa 40:3:\n“In the wilderness prepare the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert a highway\nfor our God”). The image of God’s straight path subsequently reverberates in the New\nTestament and l ater Christian and Jewish lit er a ture. For instance, Isa 40:3 is prominently\ncited towards the beginning of the synoptic Gospels (Matt 3:3, Mark 1:3, Luke 3:4), and\noccasion expect the latter, and not only the former, to combine with the attribute mustaqīm. It is therefore pref-\nerable to construe mustaqīm not as expressing a feature that is external to the semantic content of ṣirāṭ but rather\nas explicating a feature inherent in it. Taking note of the Latin ancestor of ṣirāṭ is not, therefore, fallaciously to\nprivilege etymology over Qur’anic usage; rather, the two point in the same direction, in so far as they suggest\nthat the meaning of ṣirāṭ is not identical with sabīl.\n3 This is not to deny that the text does envisage more than one “path,” as shown u nder → sabīl.\n474 ṣirāṭ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The ster eo typical coupling of right eous deeds with believing (→ āmana) through-\nout the Qur’an highlights that belief, in its Qur’anic understanding, encompasses not\nonly cognitive and emotional dimensions but is also closely associated with moral action,\ndescribed by one scholar as “the necessary supplement of belief” (Pautz 1898, 154; see\nalso Ringgren 1951, 18–19). Apart from the formulaic expression “ those who believe and\ndo righ teous deeds,” other passages express a similar nexus. For instance, Izutsu quotes\nQ 18:110, which pairs righ teousness and exclusive veneration of God: “Let him who hopes\nto meet his Lord do righ teous deeds and not associate anyone with the worship of his\nLord” (fa-m an kāna yarjū liqāʾa rabbihi fa-l -y aʿmal ʿamalan ṣāliḥan wa-l ā yushrik bi-\nʿibādati rabbihi aḥadā; see ERCQ 205 and below). Ringgren draws attention, among\nother verses, to Q 7:153, where the opposite of belief does not seem to be repudiation\n(kufr) but sin: God will forgive “ those who do evil deeds (wa-l ladhīna ʿamilū l-s ayyiʾāti)\nand then repent (thumma tābū min baʿdihā) and believe (wa- āmanū)” (Ringgren 1951,\n19). Belief, it appears, must here be understood to involve at least an anticipatory com-\nmitment to avoiding future transgressions. Incidentally, the coupling of righ teous action\nwith repentance, implied by the verse just cited, is also frequent throughout the Qur’an:\njust as belief entails or must be supplemented by concrete moral action, the same holds\nfor repentance (see under → tāba).\nIt does seem likely that the frequent coupling of belief and righ teous works would\nhave reliably predisposed the Qur’anic audience to associate one with the other even\nwhen mentioned singly. Nonetheless, it is not entirely straightforward to decide w hether\nthe Qur’an views the link between belief and righ teous deeds as a conceptual one, such\nthat at least one of them entails and encompasses the other, or whether their close as-\nsociation is simply grounded in the normative fact that God demands both and/or the\npsychological fact that belief and righ teousness are mutually reinforcing in empirical\nreali ty.2 Thus, Izutsu (ERCQ 204) remarks that the frequent coupling of belief and righ-\nteous deeds might either be taken to indicate “that these two ele ments are so inseparably\n1 For cases in which the d oing of right eous deeds is not explic itly coupled with belief, see, e.g., Q 11:11, 18:110,\n23:51.100, 25:71, or 27:19; an implicit association would however seem to be assumed.\n2 See also the remarks on the equivocality of conjunction in n. 2 of the introduction.\n476 ṣāliḥ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic word for prayer, ṣalāh, and the cor-\nresponding verb ṣallā, “to pray,” are derived from Syriac / Jewish Aramaic ṣlotā, “prayer,”1\nand ṣallī, “to pray” (FVQ 198–199). Their original Qur’anic pronunciation may have dif-\nfered from the classical one: thus, ṣallā was likely pronounced ṣallē, in line with the argu-\nment in van Putten 2017 that alif maqṣūrah (a word-fi nal yāʾ that is classically pronounced\nā) was phonetically difer ent from word- final ā. As for the noun ṣalāh, it used to be thought\nthat its customary spelling هولص in the Qur’an’s received consonantal text (except when\ncarry ing a personal suffix; e.g., Q 6:92, 11:87, 17:110) reflects Aramaic orthography (Spitaler\n1960); but a recent reassessment of the issue concludes that the word’s Qur’anic orthog-\nraphy instead reflects a pre- classical pronunciation ṣalōh, which may in turn have devel-\noped from the form ṣalawah (Al- Jallad 2017b; van Putten 2017, 64–67).2 Neither Aramaic\nzakuta, which became Arabic → zakāh, nor Jewish Aramaic / Syriac ṣlotā produced an\nArabic word ending in - ūt, as might have been expected (cf. malakūt). Instead, the two\nwords were assimilated to a native Arabic noun pattern (Rabin 1951, 109; Al- Jallad 2017b).\nGiven their frequent combination in the Qur’an, it is quite likely that ṣalāh and zakāh\nunderwent this development in tandem (see in more detail under → zakāh).\nThere can be no doubt that the noun ṣalāh and the verb ṣallā entered Arabic prior to\nthe Qur’an. Ṣallā occurs in early Arabic poetry (NB 29; GMK 149; Katz 2013, 14). For in-\nstance, two passages in the poetic corpus of Muhammad’s cont emporary al-A ʿshā Maymūn\ndescribe a Jewish wine merchant pronouncing a blessing (ṣallā) over a jar of wine (Geyer\n1905, 58–59 and 203; Ḥusayn 1983, nos 4:11 and 55:4; see Lichtenstadter 1940, 187–188;\ncf. AEL 1085), and elsewhere al-A ʿshā portrays his d aughter as exclaiming, “O my Lord\n(yā rabbi), spare my father weariness and pain!”— a speech act that a slightly later verse\ndescribes as prayer (verb: ṣallā; Ḥusayn 1983, no. 13:9.12). The Christian poet ʿAdī ibn\nZayd uses the verb, too (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 8:15). The Aramaic word for prayer was also\nloaned into Epigraphic South Arabian: in a small number of mono the istic inscriptions\nfrom Ḥimyar— one of which, found close to the Ḥimyarite capital Ẓafār and datable to\naround 400 CE, is explic itly Jewish—it appears as ṣlt (Robin 2000, 49–52; Gajda 2009,\n234; see also Beeston et al. 1982, 143). The connection between the Judaising tendency\nof Ḥimyarite mono the ism and the explic itly Jewish context of two of the prooftexts from\nthe poetry of al-A ʿshā Maymūn is cons pic u ous. The word is also attested in Safaitic, again\nas ṣlt (Al- Jallad 2017b, 83).\n1 In Jewish usage, the noun ṣlota designates specifically the shәmoneh ʿesrēh prayer (Mittwoch 1913, 7–8).\n2 The full developmental trajectory posited by Al- Jallad seems plausible for native Arabic words, such as\nnajāh, “salvation”: nagáwatu > nagáwah > nagōh. With regard to the Arabisation of Syriac or Jewish Aramaic\nṣlotā, however, the question arises w hether it was indeed reworked into an original Arabic morphological pattern\nCaCaWatu, as posited in Al- Jallad 2017b, 83, or whether the Aramaic word may not have directly become Arabic\nṣalōh, assuming that the development nagawah > nagōh had already taken place for native Arabic words. It may\nbe added that Al- Jallad constructs his hypothesis around the fact that the rasm of printed editions of the Qur’an\nspells ṣalāh + personal suffix with a medial alif rather than wāw (Al- Jallad 2017b, 84; e.g., Q 11:87 has کتلاص). To\naccommodate this, Al- Jallad posits that the original triphthong awa of Proto- Arabic underwent difer ent shifts\ndepending on whether and where it carried a stress: áwa > ō, but awa/awá > ā. The addition of a personal suffix\nwould have moved the stress to a l ater syllable, e.g., nagáwatu > nagōh but nagawátika > nagātika. Early manu-\nscripts with the spelling تلص + suffix are compatible with this, given the general orthographic uncertainty over\nwhether the long vowel ā is to be spelled defectively or plene (Al- Jallad 2017b, 84, n. 10). To be sure, the early\nmanuscript rec ord preserves some cases in which suffixed forms do indeed have a wāw. Thus, for Q 11:87, British\nLibrary Or. 2165 as transcribed on www . corpuscoranicum . de has کتولص, while Staatsbibliothek Wetzstein II\n1913 has کىولص. Yet such isolated examples may not invalidate the general theory.\n478 ṣallā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Throughout the Qur’an, ṣalāh and ṣallā can normally be rendered as\n“prayer” and “to pray.” However, t here are two Qur’anic occurrences of ṣallā ʿalā that have\nGod and the angels as their grammatical subject and for which the translation “to say bless-\nings over s.o.”— namely, over the believers and the Qur’anic Prophet (Q 33:43.56)—i mposes\nitself. By contrast, in Q 9:84.103 ṣallā ʿalā is simply “to pray on behalf of s.o.” It is currently\nimpossible to judge w hether the way in which ṣallā ʿalā functions at Q 33:43.56 continues\na pre- existing usage of the verb or is merely an ad hoc variation.\nA second general remark worth making in connection with the semantics of the\nterm ṣalāh in the Qur’an is that it indicates that use of the word to denote human\nworship of a deity had, by the time of the Qur’an, radiated beyond Jewish and Chris-\ntian communities. Thus, Q 8:35 applies the noun ṣalāh to what would appear to be\npagan rituals performed at the Meccan sanctuary: “their prayer at the house is mere\nwhistling and clapping of hands” (wa-m ā kāna ṣalātuhum ʿinda l- bayti illā mukāʾan wa-\ntaṣdiyatan). One may be tempted to query whether the verse really afords evidence that\nthe Qur’anic pagans themselves employed the word ṣalāh to refer to their rituals. Yet\nthe early Meccan verses Q 107:4–5 illustrate that there was nothing incongruous about\ndescribing the Qur’anic pagans as engaging in prayer: the passage pronounces a woe\nupon “ those who pray, // who are heedless of their prayer” (fa-w aylun li-l -m uṣallīn //\nalladhīna hum ʿan ṣalātihim sāhūn). Given the early date of Surah 107, this must refer to\na prayer ritual predating the crystallisation of a Qur’anic community of believers, most\nlikely the existing prayer ritual of the Qur’an’s pagan audience. In light of this, Q 8:35 is\nmost straightforwardly understood to mean that what the opponents preposterously\ncall “prayer” is really nothing of the sort. Seeing that animal sacrifice was a prominent\nele ment of the existing cult at the Meccan sanctuary (→ dhabaḥa), the pre- Qur’anic\nuse of the word ṣalāh may well have encompassed the invocation and veneration of a\ndeity through sacrificial rituals rather than only through verbal praise and invocations.\nThis is consistent with the early Meccan verse Q 108:2, containing a second- person\nsingular commandment to “pray to your Lord and sacrifice” (fa- ṣalli li-r abbika wa-n ḥar;\nsee SPMC 147; Böwering 2004, 218; on the verb naḥara, see under → dhabaḥa). Like\nQ 107:4–5, this injunction almost certainly refers to an established ritual that predates\nthe Qur’anic proclamations.\nAqāma l- ṣalāh, “to perform prayer.” In referring to the activity of prayer, the Qur’an\nshows a distinct preference for the complex expression aqāma l- ṣalāh, which has over\nforty occurrences, over simple ṣallā, which only appears in a dozen verses. Like the\nsimilarly bipartite phrase ātā l-z akāh, “to give alms,” with which it is standardly coupled\n(→ zakāh), aqāma l- ṣalāh is already attested well before the hijrah (e.g., Q 20:14, 27:3,\nand 30:31). It is obvious that in this collocation aqāma must mean “to perform” rather\nthan “to establish.” The phrase aqāma l- ṣalāh is to some degree reminiscent of the lo-\ncution “standing in prayer” (see also Q 4:142 and 5:6: idhā qāmū/qumtum ilā l- ṣalāti,\n“when they/youp rise to pray”), found both in Christian and rabbinic parlance (WMJA\n84–85; Wensinck 1908, 105; Mittwoch 1913, 16; but cf. Rivlin 1934, 93).3 But a passage\nfrom Barḥadhbәshabbā’s Ecclesiastical History shows that the Qur’anic expression has\nan even more specific correlate in Syriac, namely, aqīm ṣlotā, which like aqāma l- ṣalāh\nemploys the root q-w -m in a causative stem (Brockelmann 1915, 319–320, citing Nau 1913,\n3 See, e.g., TS 3524; Vööbus 1979, 140, l. 16, and 144, l. 5; m.

Moving beyond matters of etymology and phraseology, what can we learn from the\nQur’an about the nature and significance of prayer in the Qur’anic community? As already\nnoted, prayer is very frequently linked with almsgiving (→ zakāh). Q 27:2–3 and 31:3–4,\nfor instance, underline that “the believers” (al- muʾminūn) are “t hose who do good deeds”\n(al- muḥsinūn) as “t hose who perform prayer, give alms, and are certain of the hereafter” (al-\nladhīna yuqīmūna l-ṣ alāta wa-y uʾtūna l-z akāta wa-h um bi-l -ā khirati hum yūqinūn). Regular\nprayer and almsgiving, therefore, seem to be the two primary behavioural markers of being\na member of the Qur’anic community as well as the most natur al outward expressions of\nbelief in the last judgement. Prayer and charity also have the further affinity that just as the\nlatter is said to have a purifying efect, according to the Medinan verses Q 2:271 and 9:103\n(→ ṣadaqah), so 11:114 expands an admonishment to pray by declaring that “good deeds\nremove bad deeds” (inna l-ḥ asanāti yudhhibna l-s ayyiʾāti).5\nIt is far from obvious that the Qur’an attests to the five daily prayers of later Islamic\nritual (Horovitz 1927, 249–250; Rivlin 1934, 95–101; Böwering 2004, 219–228), although\nthe ambiguous nature of some of the scriptural data does allow for harmonising readings\n(Goitein 1966, 84). A string of passages mentions two daily occasions for invoking or\npraising God, one in the morning and the other in the eve ning (Q 6:52, 7:205, 18:28, 24:36,\n33:42, 40:55), and Q 24:58 (Medinan) names “the morning prayer” (ṣalāt al- fajr) and “the\neve ning prayer” (ṣalāt al-ʿ ishāʾ).6 Other verses allude to extended nocturnal devotions in\naddition to these two daytime prayers (Q 11:114, 17:78–79, 20:130, 50:39–40, 76:25–26;\nsee also 52:48–49, where the even ing prayer is omitted).7 The importance of prayer vigils\nespecially during the Meccan period is confirmed by additional pronouncements (Q 25:64,\n39:9, 51:17–18, 73:1–4), while the later insertion Q 73:20 shows a decrease of this practice\nafter the hijrah, when the Qur’anic community became a more socially inclusive body\n(Rivlin 1934, 99–100 and 102; Neuwirth 2010, 383–384; Sinai 2017a, 230–231; Sinai 2018b,\n261).8 Early Qur’anic vigils have been convincingly linked with the practice of Christian\nmonks and hermits (Wensinck 1908, 106; Andrae 1926, 191–196; Horovitz 1927, 249), and\nindeed one Qur’anic verse, Q 3:113, explic itly associates vigils and prostration with the\n“scripture- owners” (Madigan 2001, 200; Böwering 2004, 222).9 The receding of noctur-\nnal prayer in the Medinan period may be concomitant with the introduction of a third\ndaytime prayer, the “ middle prayer” (al-ṣ alāh al- wusṭā), in Q 2:238, even if some form of\n4 See also TS 3528: aqīmet- ennēn b-ṣ lotā, “he made them stand up in prayer,” and aqīm shlāmā, “he [the\ndeacon] recited the pax vobiscum.” See also SL 1332. For an alternative explanation of aqāma l- ṣalāh, see Rivlin\n1934, 93. Muslim exegetes connect the collocation aqāma l-ṣ alāh to qāmat al- sūq, “the market was under way,” and\naqāma l- sūq, presumably “to hold a market” or “to keep it in full swing” (Ṭab. 1:247 and Zam. 1:154; cf. Brockel-\nmann 1915, 317, who points to the occurrence of the phrase in DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 27:10: fī sūqin muqāmī).\n5 Another passage reflecting an association between prayer and charity is Q 11:87.\n6 See also Q 3:41, 19:11, and 38:18, occurring in the context of accounts about Zechariah and David.\n7 On Q 17:78–79, see KK 305.\n8 As pointed out to me by Saqib Hussain, Q 17:79 explic itly describes nocturnal devotions ( here designated\nby the verb tahajjada) as an additional or supererogatory devotional practice (nāfilah). It is, moreover, imposed\nin the singular, i.e., on the Qur’anic Messenger alone. This could indicate that the recession of nocturnal vigils\nbegan already in the late Meccan period.\n9 See also the remark on the monastic practice of mnēmē theou or “remembrance of God” under → dhakara.\n480 ṣallā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In other re spects, too, Medinan texts show a progressive institutionalisation\nand formalisation of the Qur’anic community’s prayer practice, such as the establishment\nof an official summons to prayer (Q 5:58, 62:9), the prescription of preparatory ablutions\n(Q 4:43, 5:6), and a mandatory congregational prayer on Fridays (Q 62:9–11).\nThe nature of the Qur’anic community’s prayer ritual can only be ascertained in very\nbroad terms. The evidence is sufficient to suggest an observance of “prayer as an institu-\ntion, consisting of set texts to be recited with precisely fixed movements of the body at\nprescribed times” (Goitein 1966, 74), in broad accordance with Jewish and Christian cus-\ntoms. Thus, Qur’anic passages mention bodily postures like prostration (verb: → sajada),\nbowing (rakaʿa; see briefly u nder → sajada), and standing (qāma), and also speech acts like\nglorifying (sabbaḥa) and praising God (noun: → ḥamd), invoking (→ dhakara) him, and\nreciting (→ qaraʾa, talā) the revelations conveyed by the Qur’anic Messenger (Rivlin 1934,\n92–96 and 107–109; Böwering 2004, 219–222; Sinai 2017a, 230; e.g., Q 2:43, 25:64, 29:45,\n39:9, 52:48–49, 76:25–26, 84:21). One is tempted to assume that t hese dif ere nt compo-\nnents of the Qur’anic ṣalāh ritual w ere modelled on cont emporary Jewish and Christian\npractices and that their reliance on standardised bodily movements and verbal utterances\nformed a contrast to the predominantly sacrificial rituals performed at the Meccan Kaʿbah.\nHowever, we saw above that the concept of prayer or ṣalāh seems to have been applied to\npre- Qur’anic pagan rites, too. This opens up the possibility that at least some of the postures\nand movements of the Qur’anic ṣalāh w ere continuous with aspects of pre- Qur’anic cultic\npractices in Mecca. Such a line of thought would be consistent with Uri Rubin’s hypothesis\nthat thanksgiving prayers at sunrise (ṣalāt al-ḍ uḥā) w ere already a feature of pre-I slamic\npagan ritual (Rubin 1987, 40–53). Angelika Neuwirth goes even further and proposes that\nthe early Meccan surahs w ere proclaimed in a situation of cultic community between the\nQur’anic Messenger and the wider Meccan public, which could have been the existing ṣalāh\nritual at the Kaʿbah (SPMC 146–147). To put it with due caution, the fact that both the prayer\nritual of the Qur’anic community and that of their “associating” (→ ashraka) opponents\ncould be designated by the terms ṣalāh and ṣallā points to a degree of behavioural overlap.\nIt is pos sib le that the curt dismissal of pagan prayer in Q 8:35 as vacuous whistling and hand-\nclapping (see above) is animated by a concern to minimise such similarity.\nAs briefly intimated in the preceding paragraph, the recitation of material from the Qur’anic\ncorpus itself came to establish itself as an impor tant part of the Qur’anic prayer ritual as it\nevolved through the Meccan period (Mittwoch 1913, 10; Goitein 1966, 82; Böwering 2004,\n221). This w ill have formed a clear hallmark of the Qur’anic community’s increasing cultic\nseparateness from the associators. Thus, Q 17:78 describes the morning prayer as “the morning\nrecitation” (qurʾān al- fajr; but cf. Rivlin 1934, 100–101; → qaraʾa); Q 35:29 links per for mance\nof the prayer with reciting God’s scripture (alladhīna yatlūna kitāba llāhi wa- aqāmū l-ṣ alāta);\n10 Q 30:17–18 pre sents the additional difficulty that it would seem to list two eve ning prayers: “Glory be\nto God when youp enter upon the time of eve ning (ḥīna tumsūna) and upon the time of morning; // to him\nbelongs praise in the heavens and on earth; and in the even ing (wa- ʿashiyyan) and when you enter upon the\ntime of noon.” However, it is conceivable that ḥīna tumsūna and wa-ʿ ashiyyan here refer to one and the same\nprayer. This reading would have the advantage of bringing Q 30:17–18 more in line with the manifold other verses\nalluding to two daytime prayers.\nṣallā 481", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, Q 34:32–33 predicts a dialogue between two sets of sinners on judgement\nday, those who deemed themselves g reat and behaved haughtily (alladhīna stakbarū) and\nthose who were oppressed (lladhīna stuḍʿifū). The exchange presupposes that the former\nwere in a position to “order” the latter “to repudiate God and to set up equals to him” (idh\ntaʾmurūnanā an nakfura bi-l lāhi wa- najʿala lahu andādan). The issue comes up again in the\nMedinan passage Q 4:97–98: it is not a sufficient excuse for t hose who die in sin (or rather,\nfor those “whom the angels take from life in a state of wronging themselves,” alladhīna\ntawaffāhumu l- malāʾikatu ẓālimī anfusihim) that they w ere “oppressed in the land,” u nless\nthey really had no way of escaping their plight.1\nThe oppressed and other indications of socio- economic in equality. It is noteworthy\nthat the verse following the eschatological dialogue between the haughty (alladhīna stak-\nbarū) and the oppressed in Q 34:32–33— namely, 34:34—s peaks of t hose inhabitants of a\ntown who are “spoilt by affluence” (mutrafūhā) as an apparent synonym for the haughty.\nIn other passages, too, it is the “affluent” inhabitants of a town who are considered the\nprimary perpetrators of sin (Q 17:16),2 who are the initial or principal victims of God’s pun-\nishment (Q 23:64), and who spearhead the opposition to God’s messengers in the name of\nancestral tradition (Q 43:23; see under → ab). In fact, the consistently negative undertones\nadhering to the passive participle mutraf and its corresponding active verb atrafa + acc.\njustify translating the latter not just as “to grant s.o. affluence,” but rather as “to spoil s.o.\nby affluence”: those who w ere mutraf during their earthly lives are depicted as ending up\nin hell (Q 56:45), and being granted a life of affluence (utrifa) is closely associated with\nwrongdoing (→ ẓalama) and sinning (ajrama; Q 11:116). The Qur’an thus seems to posit\na triangular nexus between wealth, po liti cal power, and ethico- religious corruption. This\nthree- way link is clearly discernible in Q 23:33, describing the “notables” (al- malaʾ) of an\nanonymous post- Noahide community— who are condemned for repudiating God and\nfor dismissing the eschatological judgement as a lie—as having been granted, or rather as\nhaving been spoilt by, a life of affluence (atrafnāhum fī l-ḥ ayāti l- dunyā).\nThe verbs istaḍʿafa and istakbara accordingly interlock with other terminology express-\ning diferences in po liti cal or economic status, including the term → malaʾ, designating\nthe communal leaders or notables who are often depicted as the primary opponents of\nQur’anic messengers. Moreover, in Q 26:111 Noah’s p eople are reported to say, “S hall we\nbelieve youS, when it is only the dregs (al- ardhalūn) who follow you?” and in 11:27 the re-\npudiating notables of Noah’s p eople (al- malaʾu lladhīna kafarū min qawmihi) again remind\nhim that he is only being followed by “the dregs among us” (arādhilunā). Th ese verses, too,\nbespeak a preoccupation with social status. It is reasonable to suppose that such allusions\nshed light on the social circumstances of Muhammad’s own preaching even when they\nare ostensibly concerned with the situation of e arlier messengers. This is so both b ecause\none passage expressly mentions the notables or community leaders of Muhammad’s own\nopponents (Q 38:6–8) and b ecause the adversaries of past messengers often duplicate the\nobjections voiced by the Qur’an’s con temporary antagonists (→ malaʾ).\n1 Cf. also Q 4:75 (also briefly discussed u nder → jāhada), where the “oppressed men, w omen, and c hildren”\nare said to exclaim, “Our Lord, bring us forth from this town whose inhabitants are wrongdoers and appoint for\nus a patron and helper from you!’ ”\n2 On this verse in par tic u lar, see the discussion under → khatama.\n484 istaḍʿafa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

First, post- Qur’anic\nIslamic traditions may well deserve some trust when they maintain that the original nu-\ncleus of the Meccan community included individuals who were socially, po liti cally, or\neco nomi cally marginalised or disadvantaged (although it cannot be ruled out altogether\nthat such reports are reliant on an attentive reading of the Qur’an itself rather than on\ngenuine historical memory).3 Secondly, socio- economic disadvantage appears to have\nexposed the Qur’an’s nuclear community to conformist pressures that jeopardised their\ndoctrinal and ritual commitments. In fact, such pressures are in evidence as early as\nQ 96:9–10, where a prototypical sinner is condemned for banning a servant from prayer:\nin the scenario that is h ere intimated, the ofender must have enjoyed a certain position of\nauthority or social prestige vis- à-v is the victim concerned, enabling the former to interfere\nwith the latter’s cultic behaviour.\nḍalla intr.

Like hadā (“to guide”) and ihtadā, occurrences of ḍalla are found from\nearly Meccan texts onwards (e.g., Q 68:7 and 93:7; see Räisänen 1976, 14–17). Normally,\nḍalla is intransitive, and that from which someone strays or is led astray— namely, God’s\n“path” (→ sabīl)—is preceded by the preposition ʿan (e.g., Q 5:60.77, 6:116.117, 39:8, 53:30,\n68:7); but there are also cases in which ḍalla takes the accusative (Q 2:108, 4:44, 5:12,\n25:17, 60:1). Subjects of the act of “leading astray” include not only humans (e.g., Q 3:69,\n4:113, 5:77, 6:116.119.144, 20:79.85, 26:99) or the devil (Q 4:60.119, 36:62) but frequently\nalso God (e.g., Q 2:26, 4:88.143, 6:39.125, 7:155.178.186, 9:115, 30:29). The idea of divine\nleading astray, like that of God’s “sealing” of the sinners’ hearts, could be perceived to\nhave deterministic implications (see the relevant sections of the entries on → khatama\nand → hadā). Alternatively, divine leading astray merely responds to, consolidates, and\nreinforces prior human going astray. After all, as Räisänen notes, many Qur’anic verses\nexpressly assert that “ those led astray by God have deserved this fate” (Räisänen 1976,\n13–44, quoting p. 24; see also Ahrens 1935, 84).

Like their antonyms ihtadā and hadā, the verbs ḍalla and\naḍalla belong to a layer of the Qur’an’s terminological fabric that is profoundly continuous\nwith Biblical language. The verbs ḍalla and aḍalla do occur in pre- Islamic poetry (Arazi\nand Masalha 1999, 672; e.g., DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 15:38), and in Safaitic ḍll can, for instance,\nrefer to the straying of a dog (Al- Jallad 2015a, 251 = HCH 131; see also Al- Jallad 2015a, 313).\n3 For an early attempt to mine the relevant extra- Qur’anic material, see Watt 1953, 86–99 and 170–179.\nḍalla 485", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For instances of the former two verbs,\nsee 1 Sam 26:21 (Saul confesses, “I have gone astray”), Ps 119:10 (“Do not lead me astray\nfrom your commandments”), Prov 28:10 (threatening “ those who lead astray the upright\ninto evil ways”), and Job 6:24 (Job demands, “Make me understand where I have gone\nastray”); for ṭāʿâ and hiṭʿâ, see, for instance, Ezek 13:10 (accusing false prophets of having\n“misled my people”), Ezek 14:11, 44:10.15, 48:11 (speaking of Israel’s g oing astray), and Ps\n58:4 (“The liars go astray from the womb”). The Peshitta mostly renders t hese passages by\nemploying the verbs ṭʿā, “to go astray” (Ezek 14:11, 44:10.15, 48:11, Ps 58:4, and Job 6:24;\nsee SL 540–541 and TS 1492), and aṭʿī, “to lead astray” (Gen 3:13, Ezek 13:10, Prov 28:10,\nPs 119:10; see SL 541 and TS 1493); but the Syriac Bible also uses skal, “to act foolishly,”\nand the related causative askel (1 Sam 26:21; see SL 1009–1010 and TS 2627–2629). Syriac\naṭʿī (or the derivative maṭʿyānā, “causing to go astray”) furthermore translates hiššîʾ, “to\ndeceive” (HALOT 728) at Gen 3:13 (Eve accuses the serpent of having deceived her) and\nhiznâ, “to entice to fornication” (HALOT 275) at Exod 34:16 (Canaanite wives will make\nthe sons of the Israelites “lust after their gods”). Looking at the New Testament, Syriac ṭʿā\ntranslates Greek planaomai at Matt 18:12 and 1 Pet 2:25 (both of which speak about straying\nsheep), although not at 2 Pet 2:15 (on which see also u nder → ṣirāṭ), where the Peshitta\ninstead employs shgā. The causative aṭʿī, “to lead astray,” meanwhile, renders planaō at\nMatt 24:4.11.24 (Jesus warns his disciples not to let themselves be “led astray”) or Rev 12:9,\n19:20, and 20:10 (according to which the devil or a false prophet will lead people astray).\nAt least on first impressions, then, the Peshitta is marked by a higher degree of termi-\nnological uniformity than the original text of the Bible, thereby potentially foreshadowing\nthe even more formulaic character of Qur’anic diction.4 One may hypothesise that al-\nready prior to the Qur’anic proclamations the Arabic verbs ḍalla and aḍalla were utilised\nby Arabophone Christians to render Syriac ṭʿā and aṭʿī with their rich Biblical semantic\npayload. The same may of course apply to pre-I slamic Jews as well, given that the two\nverbs also exist, with the same meanings of “to go astray” and “to lead astray,” in Jewish\nAramaic, and indeed are employed by the targums in a very similar way to the Peshitta\n(DJPA 227–228; DJBA 509).\naḍāʿa tr. | to neglect s.th., to neglect to pay s.th.\n→ ajr\nḍāqa ṣadruhu intr. | his breast became straitened or tightened\nḍāqa intr. bi-. . . dharʿan | to be distressed on account of s.o.\nḍayyiq | narrow, tight\n→ ṣadr, → nafs\n4 For a similar observation with regard to the Peshitta’s use of derivatives of the root d- ḥ-l , see Becker\n2009, 314.\n486 aḍāʿa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It tends to stand in opposition to God: believing (→ āmana) in God\nor turning to him is equivalent to repudiating (→ kafara) or avoiding (ijtanaba) al-ṭ āghūt\n(Q 2:256, 16:36, 39:17); t hose who repudiate God are the allies of al-ṭ āghūt (Q 2:257); and\nfighting in the path (→ sabīl) of God is contrasted with fighting in the path of al-ṭ āghūt\n(Q 4:76). Although the word is grammatically a singular, it can have a plural or collective\nmeaning (NB 48; see also KK 97 on Q 4:60). Thus, in Q 2:257 al-ṭ āghūt are described as\nthe “patrons” (awliyāʾ; singular: → waliyy) of the repudiators, and the word takes a plural\nverb. Elsewhere, though, the Qur’an employs singular pronouns, both masculine and\nfeminine, to refer back to al-ṭ āghūt (Q 4:60: wa- qad umirū an yakfurū bihi; Q 39:17: wa-\nlladhīna jtanabū l- ṭāghūta an yaʿbudūhā), although the feminine singular might of course\nbe understood to refer to an inanimate plurality.\nEtymologically, the word has been derived from Classical Ethiopic ṭāʿot (NB 35, 48;\nFVQ 202–203), whose meaning is glossed as both “idol” and “ungodliness” (Leslau 1991,\n584). The Ethiopic word has itself an Aramaic origin, ṭaʿuta, literally “error.” Aramaic\nṭaʿuta and occasionally also its Hebrew cognate ṭaʿut can be employed to refer to idols\n487", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This makes it pos si ble to argue that adjudication between an\nEthiopic and an Aramaic etymology is not pos si ble (van Putten 2020b, 69). The reason\nwhy the Qur’anic text has ṭāghūt rather than ṭāʿūt is presumably that the Ethiopic (or\nAramaic?) term, when borrowed into Arabic, came to be associated with the Arabic root\nṭ-g h-w /y, denoting excess, immoderation, and a transgression of proper bound aries (see\nKropp 2008, 210; on ṭ-g h-w /y in the Qur’an, refer to CDKA 173).\nWhat ever its precise etymology, Qur’anic al-ṭ āghūt should clearly be rendered in such\na way as to accord with the fact that al- ṭāghūt figures as an object of veneration (verb:\nʿabada) in Q 39:17 (see also 5:60). This rules out the abstract noun “idolatry.” “Idols” or “the\nidols” is v iable (e.g., Arberry 1955 and Paret 2001), but as Jones remarks in a footnote, the\nrendering “false gods” is equally feasible (Jones 2007, 58, n. 40). In fact, the latter seems\nmarginally preferable, since “idols” may well be overly specific: to speak of “idols” implies\nnot just a veneration of non- divine entities that are erroneously considered to be divine,\nsuch as the “gods” (ālihah) or “partner deities” (shurakāʾ) invoked by the Qur’an’s “asso-\nciating” opponents (see under → ashraka), but more particularly a veneration of statues\nand images of the sort that other Qur’anic passages call aṣnām or awthān, chiefly in the\ncontext of narratives about Abraham’s confrontation with his idolatrous compatriots (see\nunder → dhabaḥa). The more abstract translation “false gods” certainly chimes with the\ncontrast between serving or believing in God (allāh) and serving or believing in al-ṭ āghūt\nthat emerges from verses like Q 2:256 or 16:36.

The root ṭ- h- r expresses meanings to do with ritual purity and purification not\nonly in Hebrew and Jewish Aramaic (HALOT 369–370; DJBA 494–495) but also in Sabaic\n(Beeston et al. 1982, 153; Maraqten 2021, 446–448) and in a Safaitic inscription (MA 1 in\nAl- Jallad 2015a, 272, and Al- Jallad 2022, 46). Practices of ritual purity w ere consequently\nwell known in the Qur’an’s Arabian environment. It is unsurprising, therefore, that in the\nQur’an, too, the root ṭ- h- r (on which see generally Lowry 2004) can appear in contexts\nthat one might classify as “ritual.” This is most obviously the case in the two Medinan\nverses Q 5:6 and 2:222, which will be treated first. Yet as the entry will go on to show,\nother occurrences of the root ṭ- h- r play a distinctly non- ritual, ethical role. The entry w ill\nfinish by widening the scope and examining the general significance that the language of\npurity plays in the Qur’an. It will be argued that ritual purity is of comparatively subordi-\nnate importance in the Qur’anic world- view and that the Islamic scripture is marked by a\ntendency to employ the notion of purity in a figurative and moralising sense.\nThe root ṭ- h- r and ritual purity in Q 5:6. Q 5:6 tells the addressees that before “rising to\npray” (idhā qumtum ilā l-ṣ alāti) they must perform a ritual of partial ablution, consisting in\nwashing their faces and hands and wiping their heads and feet (KK 115–116, with a detailed\ndiscussion of an impor tant reading variant).1 Let us call this segment (a) of the verse. The\nfollowing portion of text, segment (b), adds that “if youp are polluted (junub), then purify\nyourselves (fa-ṭ ṭahharū).” It might be felt that segment (b) deems junub impurity, what ever\nit may be (see below), to require a more thorough form of washing that involves not just\none’s face, head, hands, and feet but also the rest of one’s body. If so, the distinction that\nlater Muslim scholars make between a partial ablution termed wuḍūʾ and a full ablution\ntermed ghusl (see generally Katz 2002, 2, and Maghen 2007) would be at least implicitly\npre sent in the Qur’an, despite the fact that the latter nowhere employs the word wuḍūʾ\nitself.2 At least equally likely, however, is the interpretation that segment (a) merely voices\na strong recommendation that any prayer be preceded by a minimal kind of lustration,\nperhaps for reasons of caution, upon which segment (b) stresses further that purification\n1 Against the view of later Muslim scholars, I am assuming that the phrase “to rise to prayer” (qāma ilā\nl- ṣalāh) means “to get ready to pray” rather than “to rise from sleep to pray” (see Maghen 2007, section 2). The\nformer interpretation of qāma ilā l-ṣ alāh is also preferable for Q 4:142.\n2 Thus, Rivlin thinks that taṭahhara in Q 5:6 means “a special type of purification, prob ably of the entire\nbody” (Rivlin 1934, 88). Contextually, one might put forward the following argument from redundancy: given\nthat segment (a) requires that anyone getting ready to pray must perform a minimum form of ablution involving\nthe face, head, hands, and feet, what sense would it make for segment (b) to then go on to prescribe the very\nsame ritual for a specific case (namely, for t hose who are ritually impure) that is already sufficiently covered by\nthe preceding rule (which seemingly applies to every one)? The argument aims to show that the only way to\navoid treating segment (b) as redundant is to take taṭahhara to mean something dif ere nt than the ritual of partial\nablution described in segment (a). But as the main text goes on to argue, we cannot take for granted that the\nimperatives in segment (a) of Q 5:6 must necessarily be interpreted to convey strict obligation. This possibility\nobviates the threat of redundancy entailed by equating the verb taṭahhara from segment (b) with the ritual of\nablution prescribed in segment (a).\nṭahara/ṭahura 489", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In other words, the imperatives “wash” (fa- ghsilū) and “wipe” (wa- msaḥū) in\nsegment (a) could designate something short of categorical obligation, a potential use of\nthe imperative of which l ater Muslim scholars w ere duly aware (Weiss 2010, 329, 343–344).\nIf so, then the verb taṭahhara, “to purify oneself,” in segment (b) need not refer to a more\nextensive kind of washing than the minimal type of ablution detailed in segment (a).\nCan we say anything about what it meant to be junub in the Qur’anic milieu? Q 5:6\ncontains a further stipulation, segment (c), that may ofer a clue: “If youp are sick or on a\njourney, or one of you comes from the privy or you have touched w omen (aw lāmastumu\nl-n isāʾa) and you cannot find water, have recourse to good soil (fa-t ayammamū ṣaʿīdan\nṭayyiban) and wipe your faces and your hands with it.” This is followed by a final flourish,\nsegment (d), which asserts that God does not wish to “place any difficulty (ḥaraj)” upon\nthe addressees and that he desires to “purify” them (yurīdu li-y uṭahhirakum). As the use of\nḥaraj, “difficulty” (CDKA 68; Lowry 2015–2016, 102–103), in segment (d) makes explicit,\nthe preceding segment (c) serves as an exemptive hardship clause similar to the one\nthat is found a few verses e arlier in Q 5:3, where the believers are granted permission to\nviolate the Qur’an’s dietary rules—i .e., to eat carrion, blood, pork, or sacrificial meat—in\nemergency situations (see generally Sinai 2019c). God, desiring ease rather than hardship\n(cf. Q 2:185; cf. Matt 11:30), has provided the believers with a means of maintaining their\nritual purity even in exceptional circumstances in which no w ater is to hand, thus shielding\nthem from undue difficulty: in case of necessity, ablutions may be performed with clean\nsoil instead of w ater, a provision that has a parallel in the Bablyonian Talmud, at b. Bәr.\n15a (GQ 1:199; see also WMJA 86).\nWhat matters most in the pre sent context is that the concessionary segment (c), at\nleast if read without too many preconceptions, would appear to imply that coming from\nthe privy and having “touched” (lāmastum) women are two of the situations that neces-\nsitate some form of symbolic ablution (namely, wiping one’s face and hands with soil). It\nis tempting, therefore, to seize on t hese two incidents as two Qur’anic examples of junub\nimpurity, though this w ill only be v iable if the acts of washing and wiping described in\nsegments (a) and (c) are indeed equated with the purification required by segment (b),\nwhich is where the term junub figures in the verse.3 Assuming this interpretive step, what\ndoes it mean to “touch” w omen? Th ere is vivid debate in the Islamic tradition w hether the\nphrase is a euphemism for sexual contact or whether it means literal touching between\nthe genders (Maghen 2005, 137–142; see also Katz 2002, 86–96 and 149–155). The former\nview, championed by the Ḥanafī school, can appeal to other Qur’anic passages that simi-\nlarly refer to sexual intercourse in euphemistic terms— for instance, by employing the verb\nmassa, “to touch” (e.g., Q 19:20, 33:49), whose literal meaning is synonymous with that of\nlāmasa, or the verb qariba, “to approach,” in Q 2:222 (see below).4 Hence, although the\n3 To consider defecation an event that induces junub impurity would, of course, contradict the l ater Islamic\nunderstanding that the state of janābah or of being junub is only occasioned by one of the “major polluting\nevents” (al- aḥdāth al- kubrā) like menstruation or a discharge of semen.

If that is correct, then junub in its\nQur’anic sense subsumes two circumstances that in classical Islamic law fall into dif er ent\ncategories of polluting events.\nThe exegetical prob lems surrounding Q 5:6 are compounded by its partial overlap with\nanother verse, Q 4:43, whose chrological relationship to 5:6 is treated in some detail in the\nexcursus at the end of this entry. In the context of the pre sent discussion, however, the only\nimpor tant piece of evidence that Q 4:43 adds is the observation that it employs ightasala, “to\nwash oneself,” instead of taṭahhara, thus confirming the impression that in Q 5:6 “purifying\noneself” refers to ablution. In sum, taṭahhara as used in Q 5:6 prob ably refers to purifica-\ntion by a minimal form of ablution, which serves to remove ritual impurity that might, for\ninstance, be occasioned by defecation or sexual contact. Despite the inevitable vagueness\nand precariousness of this interpretation, it fits well with the fact that washing prior to\nundertaking certain religious rites, such as entering a t emple, performing a pilgrimage, or\nmaking a sacrifice, is also attested in Sabaic and Safaitic inscriptions (Al- Jallad 2022, 44–46;\nMaraqten 2021, 447–448). While a Safaitic inscription employs ṭhr to refer to such ablutions\n(see MA 1 in Al- Jallad 2015a, 272, and Al- Jallad 2022, 46), recalling the Qur’anic taṭahhara\nfrom Q 2:222 (see below) and 5:6, Sabaic uses the verb ġsl (CIH, no. 523, l. 7, and no. 533,\nl. 5) that is cognate with ightasala in Q 4:43 and ghasala in Q 5:6.\nQ 2:222. The second Qur’anic passage in which ṭ- h- r is used in a ritual sense, Q 2:222, de-\nscribes menstruation (al-m aḥīḍ) as a “harm” (adhā) and commands the Qur’anic community,\n“So avoid (fa-ʿ tazilū) menstruating w omen (al-n isāʾa fī l-m aḥīḍi), and do not approach them\n(wa- lā taqrabūhunna) u ntil they have become pure again (ḥattā yaṭhurna); when they have\npurified themselves (fa-i dhā taṭahharna), then come to them as God has commanded you.”\nThis is presumably a ban on intercourse during menstruation, with “to approach” (qariba)\nserving as a euphemism for sexual contact just as lāmasa appears to do in Q 5:6. The prohibi-\ntion has a Biblical parallel in Lev 18:19 and 20:18. Yet intercourse with a menstruating w oman\nwas a taboo in South Arabian culture as well; two Sabaic inscriptions already cited use the\nverb “to approach” (qrb) in this context (CIH, no. 523, l. 2, and no. 533, l. 3), prob ably also\nfor intercourse (see the translation of CIH, no. 533 in Maraqten 2021, 448; see also Beeston\net al. 1982, 106, and Robin 2015a, 111).5 Unlike the Hebrew Bible, the Qur’an does not specify\na statutory length for a w oman’s period (cf. Lev 15:19) nor does it spell out w hether menstru-\nating w omen can pass on impurity by contagion (cf. Lev 15:19–24), but such m atters could\nbe presupposed (see also Rivlin 1934, 86–87). While the verse does not set out any detailed\nrituals of post- menstrual purification, such as the rabbinic requirement of immersion in a\nritual bath or miqweh, in Q 2:222 too the verb taṭahhara likely refers to the per for mance of\nsome sort of ablution, in line with the preceding discussion of Q 5:6 (thus also Rivlin 1934,\n87). Although Q 2:222 does not use the term junub, it would seem that the common elem ent\nnecessitating purificatory washing according to 2:222 and 5:6 is bodily discharge—w hether\ndue to defecation, ejaculation (which Q 5:6 prob ably presupposes as a normal component of\nsexual contact), or menstruation.\nNon- ritual uses of root ṭ-h -r .

Another pertinent example is\nQ 9:108, where taṭahhara (“to keep oneself pure”) and the corresponding active partici-\nple al- muṭṭahhirūn (“ those who keep themselves pure”) function as synonyms for righ-\nteousness in general. Similarly, Q 33:53 describes the requirement that the Prophet’s wives\nremain screened from ordinary believers as conducive to purity of heart (→ qalb) on the\npart of all parties concerned (dhālikum aṭharu li-q ulūbikum wa-q ulūbihinna). In Q 7:82\nand 27:56, too, where the verb taṭahhara, “to keep o.s. pure,” is used by the compatriots\nof Lot to describe the latter’s rejection of “approaching men in lust rather than women”\n(Q 7:81, 27:55), the root’s moral sense is prob ably dominant: the suggestion is hardly that\nwhat ever homosexual practices are being condemned in these two place occasion ritual\nimpurity that could be removed by, say, ablution.\nThe fifth-f orm verb taṭahhara can thus mean e ither ritual purification, prob ably by ablu-\ntion (Q 2:222, 5:6), as well as keeping oneself morally pure. By contrast, it is less clear that the\nsecond- form verb ṭahhara (“to purify”) ever has what one might call a ritually concrete sense\nin the Qur’an. The verb can certainly designate the cleansing efect of almsgiving (Q 9:103:\nkhudh min amwālihim ṣadaqatan tuṭahhiruhum wa- tuzakkīhim bihā), but the point h ere\nmust be that charitable renunciation is a means of attaining divine forgiveness (see also\nunder → ṣadaqah). Twice, ṭahhara takes God’s “house” (→ bayt) as its object (Q 2:125,\n22:26): Abraham is instructed to “purify” God’s h ouse “for t hose performing circumam-\nbulation [around it], who are devoted [to it], who bow and who prostrate themselves” (an\nṭahhirā baytiya li- l-ṭ āʾifīna wa- l-ʿ ākifīna wa- l- rukkaʿi l- sujūd). Although this could be read\nas saying that Abraham is to maintain the Meccan sanctuary in a ritually pure condition, it\nis more convincing to assume that Abraham is bidden to ensure the Kaʿbah’s status as a site\nof untainted, pure mono thei sm, considering that in Q 22:26 the commandment just cited is\npreceded by a divine admonishment not to “associate anything with God” (an lā tushrik bī\nshayʾan; see Zellentin 2022, 287). In line with this, Q 9:28 (on which see below) explic itly\ndescribes t hose who associate other beings with God as “filth” (see also u nder → jāhada).\nIn other cases, the verb ṭahhara with God as the grammatical subject would simply seem to\nmean that someone is being rendered or deemed worthy of being admitted to God’s pres-\nence (e.g., Q 3:42). This is prob ably also the sense in which Q 2:25, 3:15, and 4:57 promise\nthe Qur’anic believers “purified spouses” (→ azwāj ˻muṭahharah), an expression treated\nin a separate entry following the pre sent one. Fin ally, the adjective ṭahūr, “pure,” too, may\nnot have a ritual sense e ither. Q 76:21 says that the blessed in paradise w ill be given “a pure\ndrink” (sharāb ṭahūr), while Q 25:48 refers to God’s sending down of “pure w ater” (māʾan\n6 On the contrast between ritual and moral impurity in the Hebrew Bible, see Klawans 2000.\n492 ṭahara/ṭahura", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Possibly, the adjective means simply “ wholesome” or “salubrious”\nrather than denoting the trait of being a ritually pure substance (although earthly wine is\nof course declared to be “filfth,” rijs, in Q 5:90).\nGeneral remarks on purity in the Qur’an. To attempt a general assessment of the\nimportance of purity in the Qur’an, we saw that the Islamic scripture endorses a l imited\nrange of practices, prob ably pre- existing ones, that are concerned with managing im-\npurity and pollution, by mandating ablutions before prayer and some form of washing\nafter defecation and in cases of male and female genital discharge (Q 2:222, 4:43, 5:6).\nThe Qur’an also declares certain foodstufs, such as wine and pork, to be categorically\nprohibited by calling them “filth” (rijs; see Q 5:90, 6:145, and under → rijz/rujz). None-\ntheless, the Qur’anic religion can hardly be said to be particularly preoccupied with or\napprehensive about issues of ritual purity, especially if one compares the scant amount of\nmaterial just cata logued with the frequency with which the Qur’anic believers are urged\nto pray (→ ṣallā), give alms (→ razaqa, → zakāh, → ṣadaqah), or “contend on God’s path”\n(→ jāhada). In many cases, one would be excused for considering the Qur’an’s recourse\nto notions of purity and impurity to function as (undoubtedly potent) meta phors, in the\nsense that they amount to a secondary transference of the vocabulary of purity from the\nritual realm to the ethical one.7\nThe impurity of the associators (Q 9:28). By way of a final example for this Qur’anic\ntendency to employ vocabulary associated with ritual purity as potent meta phors, one\nmight point to Q 9:28, where the believers are told that “the associators are filth” (innamā\nl- mushrikūna najasun) and are accordingly forbidden from approaching the sacred place\nof prostration (al- masjid al- ḥarām; see under → sajada and → ḥarrama) after the pre sent\nyear. The root n- j- s seems to be associated with ritual impurity in Sabaic (Beeston et al.\n1982, 93, and Maraqten 2021, 449, with a transliteration and translation of CIH, no. 548, l.\n3). Yet the net point made in Q 9:28 is not that interaction with t hose who worship other\ndeities than Allāh is subject to a set of precise rules serving to manage impurity at the level\nof concrete ritual behaviour—s ay, by commanding the believers to perform ablutions after\nhaving come in contact with associators or to perform some sort of purification ceremony\nthat will cleanse the Meccan Kaʿbah from idolatrous pollution. Rather, the point made\nin Q 9:28 is simply that those who hold false beliefs and engage in reprehensible cultic\npractices are thereby disqualified from worshipping at the Meccan sanctuary. In Q 9:28,\nthe Qur’anic rejection of associationism is expressed by recourse to what seems to have\nbeen an existing Arabian term for ritual impurity, but this is hardly more than a meta-\nphorical variation on the countless other Qur’anic passages dismissing the worship of\nfalse deities in epistemic terms (it is based on false belief) or in ethical ones (it amounts\nto ingratitude and disobedience t owards the creator). For example, an e arlier passage in\nSurah 9, Q 9:17–18 (on which see in more detail u nder → ʿamara), abolishes the associators’\ncontrol over, or perhaps even their very access to, the Meccan sanctuary without making\nany reference to the associators’ impurity, simply on the ground that they are guilty of\nrepudiation (kufr; v. 17).\n7 Klawans 2000 rejects the position that Biblical passages that speak of what he classifies as “moral purity”\nare adequately described as meta phorical or figurative (see especially Klawans 2000, 32–36). But it would require\na separate argument to show that the same holds true for the Qur’an (e.g., by demonstrating that the Qur’an\npersistently conceptualises sin as an occurrence of defilement whose efects and remedies are only intelligible\nin terms of an underlying logic of purity).\nṭahara/ṭahura 493", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It makes sense, therefore, to supplement the above discussion with a\nbrief examination of the relationship of these two passages, both Medinan.\nQ 4:43— which is positioned at the very end of Surah 4’s opening panel (Sinai 2021,\n373–374)—b egins by calling on the believers not to “approach prayer” (lā taqrabū l-ṣ alāta)\nin two states: first, while intoxicated “ until youp know what you are saying”; and secondly,\nwhile polluted (junub) until “you have washed yourselves” (ḥattā taghtasilū). Those who\nonly happen to pass by (illā ʿābirī sabīlin) are excepted from the latter proscription, mean-\ning prob ably that there is no ban on those who are impure coming physically near a place\nof prayer (KK 95).8 This initial segment of the verse is followed by an almost verbatim\nparallel of Q 5:6’s concessionary segment (c), permitting ablution with soil if w ater is not\nto hand and making up the bulk of 4:43. The only diference in wording between Q 4:43\nand 5:6 here consists in the fact that 5:6 eliminates a minor source of potential ambiguity:\nthe believers are not merely instructed to find clean soil and “wipe your faces and your\nhands” (Q 4:43) but rather to “wipe your f aces and your hands with it (minhu).” This minor\naddition has the efect of clarifying beyond any residual doubt that the “good soil” (ṣaʿīdan\nṭayyiban) mentioned before is to serve not as the place at which substitute ablutions are to\ntake place but rather as the instrument with which they are to be performed. Q 4:43 ends\nwith a brief clausula asserting God’s readiness to forgive.\nRivlin very plausibly proposes that Q 4:43 is chronologically earlier than 5:6 (Rivlin\n1934, 88). Lined up in this temporal sequence, Q 4:43 does not yet urge a default per for-\nmance of ablution before praying and limits the demand that one must wash before prayer\nto t hose who are junub. Q 5:6 then goes further and commands, or at least strongly recom-\nmends, that anyone preparing to pray perform a partial or minimal form of ablution while\nalso reiterating that self-p urification is particularly essential if one is junub. Moreover, Q 5:6\nspecifies which limbs and body parts are to be included in the default form of minimal\nablution prescribed. Fin ally, Q 5:6 recaps the emergency clause previously articulated in\n4:43 to the efect that water may under certain circumstances be replaced with soil. One\nreason why Rivlin’s relative dating of Q 4:43 and 5:6 is convincing is the fact that it has\nthe consequence of making Q 5:6 an instance of a more general Qur’anic pattern that I\nhave proposed to call “specification” or “interpretive spawning” (Sinai 2021, 367–373): a\nchronologically earlier passage (in the pre sent case, Q 4:43) may be conjectured to have\ngiven rise to an audience query (what, precisely, counts as sufficiently “washing” oneself\nin order to remove impurity?), which query is then answered in a chronologically later\nQur’anic statement (namely, Q 5:6). Note that Rivlin himself proposes that Q 5:6 “in a\ncertain sense abrogates” 4:43, given that the former verse introduces default ablutions for\nanyone getting ready to pray rather than only for the impure, thus imposing additional\n8 By contrast, Rivlin thinks that the exception pertains to travellers, meaning that the prohibition to “ap-\nproach prayer” when junub would be entirely waived for t hose who are on a journey (Rivlin 1934, 88). But note\nthat this understanding creates a contradiction with the provision to perform ablutions with soil rather than\nwater later on in the verse: this permission presupposes that even travellers must ensure their ritual purity while\npraying; the only concession made concerns the manner in which impurity is to be removed, not the basic\ndemand that it be removed.\n494 ṭahara/ṭahura", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But it is of course perfectly conceivable that Q 5:6 might\nplay both a specifying and an abrogating role with regard to 4:43.\nOne may highlight two further observations supporting Rivlin’s contention that Q 5:6\nis the later of the two passages. First, in Q 5:6 the permission to use soil instead of w ater\nis followed, in segment (d), by an explicit theological rationale invoking God’s wish to\navoid placing undue difficulty (ḥaraj) on the believers; rather, God wants to “purify” the\nbelievers and to complete his “grace” (niʿmah; → anʿama) upon them. Such an explicit\nrationale is largely absent in Q 4:43, where the concessionary stipulation permitting ablu-\ntions with soil rather than water is followed only by a very brief predication of two divine\nattributes to do with God’s disposition to forgive. Surah 5 may thus be considered to adopt\nthe concessionary stipulation from Q 4:43 while expanding it with an explicit theologi-\ncal reflection and placing it in close proximity to a similar concession in dietary m atters\n(Q 5:3). Secondly, as we saw above, the way in which the concession to use soil instead of\nwater is phrased in Q 5:6 removes a potential misunderstanding of 4:43. Both the more\nexplic itly theological character of Q 5:6 and its greater clarity in one specific practical re-\nspect tally well with Rivlin’s hypothesis that 5:6 is chronologically later than 4:43. The fact\nthat Q 5:6 explic itly casts the requirement to wash before prayer as conducive to purity,\nby employing two derivatives of ṭ- h- r— namely, the fifth-f orm verb taṭahhara in segment\n(b) and the second-f orm verb ṭahhara in segment (d)—f urther confirms the impression\nthat 5:6 is terminologically more developed.\nIncidentally, as I have argued elsewhere, the version of the Qur’anic dietary prohibitions\nthat is found in Q 5:3 is also likely to be l ater than its three other Qur’anic parallels (Sinai\n2019c, 132), and the impetus to clarification that may be perceived in Q 5:6’s addition of\nminhu (“with it”) to the concessionary stipulation from 4:43 resembles similar clarifica-\ntory concerns in the dietary regulations set out in 5:3–4 (Sinai 2019c, 116–117). It appears,\ntherefore, that the opening passage of Surah 5 quite deliberately draws together chrono-\nlogically earlier commandments while surrounding them with theologising commentary\nand expanding them with miscellaneous practical elucidations.\nmuṭahhar: azwāj ~ah | purified spouses\nFurther vocabulary discussed: zawj | spouse jannah | garden k halada intr. | to re-\nmain forever, to be immortal ḥūr pl. | gazelle- eyed fair maidens zawwaja tr. bi- |\nto wed s.o. to s.o. ṣalaḥa intr. | to be righ teous dhurriyyah | offspring ṭahhara\ntr. | to purify s.o. or s.th. qarraba tr. | to bring s.o. near, to allow s.o. to come near\nal- muqarrabūn pl. | t hose brought near (to God)\nFrom the early Meccan houris to the Medinan “purified spouses.” Three Medinan vers-\nes— Q 2:25, 3:15, and 4:57—p romise the inhabitants of paradise or the “garden” (→ jannah)\nazwāj muṭahharah, “purified spouses” (see also u nder → zawj).

Two verses\nout of t hese four houri references (Q 44:54 and 52:20) specify that God w ill “pair” or “wed”\n(zawwaja) the blessed with the houris.1 With the exception of Surah 38, all the passages just\nenumerated have a mean verse length below that of Surah 15 (43.12 transliteration letters)\nand therefore fall below the cut- of value for the early Meccan surahs that I have proposed\nelsewhere (HCI 161). Surah 38, in view of its higher mean verse length of 51.98 translitera-\ntion letters, contains a slightly l ater reverberation of the early Meccan houri descriptions.2\n(ii) In the later Meccan period, Q 36:55–56 places the “inhabitants of the garden”\n(aṣḥāb al-j annah) in the com pany of their “spouses” (azwāj): “They and their spouses\n(azwājuhum) are in shades, reclining on couches.” Q 43:70, also l ater Meccan, similarly\ndepicts how the blessed are invited to enter paradise together with their azwāj: “Enter\nthe garden, you [masculine plural] and your spouses.” Especially Q 43:70 makes it certain\nthat reference h ere is to the believers’ earthly wives rather than to new spouses acquired\nonly in the hereafter (Horovitz 1975, 57). Both Q 36:56 and 43:70 thus introduce the noun\nzawj into the context of paradise, even if the under lying root z- w- j is already pre sent in\ntwo verses from category (i), Q 44:54 and 52:20, which promise that God will “pair” the\nblessed with houris. Given that the mean verse length of Surahs 36 and 43 is 55.01 and\n61.78 transliteration letters, respectively, Q 36:56 and 43:70 are very likely later than the\nstatements in category (i), although the gap to Q 38:52 (51.98 transliteration latters) is too\nsmall to rule out some diachronic overlap.\n(iii) Two further relevant Meccan statements are Q 40:8 and 13:23. Q 40:7–8 report an\nangelic prayer imploring God to lead the believers into paradise in addition to “t hose of\ntheir f athers and spouses and ofspring who are right eous” (man ṣalaḥa min ābāʾihim wa-\nazwājihim wa- dhurriyyātihim). The same formula recurs in Q 13:23. Both verses thus retain\nthe eschatological usage of the term azwāj already seen in group (ii), yet take impor tant\nsteps t owards doctrinal systematisation. First, the believers’ spouses are now complemented\nby two further categories of f amily members, parents and c hildren. Secondly, Q 13:23 and\n40:8 add the crucial proviso that any relatives who are to enter paradise must themselves\nhave been right eous (man ṣalaḥa min . . .). This rules out that a believer’s spouse, parents,\nor c hildren might be admitted into paradise simply on account of the moral and religious\nmerit accumulated by the current head of the f amily, a possibility that is at least left open\nby the wording of the passages surveyed u nder (ii). The pro gress in systematisation and\ndoctrinal reflection seen in Q 40:8 and 13:23 accords with the fact that the mean verse length\nof Surahs 40 and 13 (89.20 and 126.16) is higher than that of any the surahs containing\n1 In favour of zawwaja = “to wed,” see inter alia the use of azwāj = “spouses” in Q 26:166 (my awareness of\nwhich I owe to Davitashvili 2021, 46). Since Surah 26 has about the same mean verse length as Surah 44, the\nmeaning of zawwaja in Q 44:54 and also in 52:20 is legitimately construed in light of the meaning of azwāj in\nQ 26:166.\n2 According to Horovitz 1975, 57 (echoed in Lange 2016a, 51), the chronologically latest verse mentioning\nthe houris is Q 44:54; but the mean verse length of Surah 44 (36.61 transliteration letters) is palpably lower than\nthat of Surah 38 (51.98).\n496 muṭahhar", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 40:8 and 13:23 should therefore be\ndated later than all other Meccan statements about paradisiacal mates and spouses. A third\nverse to be included in group (iii) is Q 52:21, which shares with Q 40:8 and 13:23 the noun\ndhurriyyah and pledges that the believers w ill be eschatologically reu nited with t hose of\ntheir “ofspring” (dhurriyyah) who “follow them in belief” (Horovitz 1975, 57, and Lange\n2016a, 52). This matches Q 40:8 and 13:23’s demand that anyone entering paradise must\nqualify on his or her own merit. Surah 52 is an early Meccan composition, but the verse at\nhand, or at least the bulk of it, has been convincingly identified as a l ater insertion (GQ 1:105;\nHorovitz 1975, 57; Neuwirth 2007, 203; PP 690–691; Davitashvili 2021, 85–89).

In-\ndeed, Davitashvili argues, based on a cumulation of lexical observations, that the verse is\nMedinan (Davitashvili 2021, 86–87).\nTo summarise the developmental trajectory thus outlined, in progressing from (i) to\n(ii) Qur’anic discourse substitutes the prospect that the (male) believers will be eschato-\nlogically “coupled” (zawwaja) with beautiful virgins, presented as part of the delightful\namenities of paradise, by the prospect of an other-w orldly union between the believers\nand their earthly wives (Horovitz 1975, 68; Robinson 2003a, 89). It is pos sib le that this\ninvolved a re- reading of the early Meccan virgins of paradise as being identical to the\nbelievers’ spouses, in so far as the root z- w- j also occurs in category (i).3 In subsequently\nmoving on to category (iii), the Qur’anic proclamations aver that the believers’ spouses\nwill themselves need to earn admission to paradise by having led a life of right eousness.\nTogether, categories (ii) and (iii) amount to a decisive shift away from an androcentric\nperspective according to which women in the hereafter are chiefly envisaged as an ap-\npendage to the male occupants of paradise and towards viewing women as full moral and\neschatological subjects in their own right, a shift that continues to resonate in subsequent\nMedinan passages (e.g., Q 4:124, 9:72, 33:35, 48:5, 57:12, 66:10–12).4\nIn what sense are the paradisiacal spouses “purified”? Having thus reviewed the Mec-\ncan background to the “purified spouses” (azwāj muṭahharah) mentioned in the Medinan\nverses Q 2:25, 3:15, and 4:57, we may move on to consider the meaning of the attribute\n“purified.” Al- Ṭabarī, basing himself on a range of early exegetical authorities, glosses the\nattribute to mean “that they are purified from every impurity and defilement and matter\ngiving rise to suspicion that is found among the w omen of this world, such as menstruation,\nchildbirth, excrements, urine, mucus, saliva, and [female] sperm, and similar impurity,\nblemishes, suspicious matters, and loathsome t hings” (Ṭab. 1:419). Such a construal im-\nplies that, as one of the statements reported by al- Ṭabarī puts it, “the wives of this world\nare not purified,” expressing the view that women in their natur al, this-w orldly state are\nafflicted with a wide range of impurities, a state of afairs explained by the disobedience\nof Eve (Ṭab. 1:419). In support of al- Ṭabarī’s understanding of the attribute muṭahhar, one\nmight adduce a statement by Ephrem that the bodies of the blessed will be purified from\nblood and bleeding (Beck 1957a, On Paradise, no. 9:19).\n3 The main argument for such a re- reading is the secondary insertion of Q 52:21— promising the believers\nthat they will be eschatologically united with their believing ofspring (dhurriyyah)— immediately after a verse\n(Q 52:20) mentioning the believers’ pairing or marriage (z- w- j) to the houris. This is plausibly linked with the\ncombination of the believers’ spouses (rather than houris) and ofspring in Q 40:8 and 13:23.\n4 A similar development is posited in Bauer and Hamza, forthcoming, who undertake a comprehensive\nexamination of Qur’anic comments on women across all periods of the text.\nmuṭahhar 497", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Building on what is said elsewhere (→ ṭahara), it is particularly\nrelevant to consider occurrences of the geminated verbal stem ṭahhara that pertain to God’s\npurification of, or refusal to purify, certain humans or their hearts (Q 3:42.55, 5:6.41, 8:11,\n33:33): to be “made pure” (verb: ṭahhara) by God h ere would seem to mean being found\nacceptable to God and being admitted into his proximity, a sense that is well illustrated by\nGod’s announcement to Jesus that he w ill “take you away and raise you to me and purify\nyou of the repudiators” (Q 3:55). As regards specifically the passive participle muṭahhar,\n“purified,” it appears not only in references to the believers’ purified spouses, as in Q 2:25,\nbut is also applied to celestial objects or beings that are located particularly close to the\ndeity: in Q 56:79, the privilege of “touching” the celestial scripture is reserved for “the\npurified,” al- muṭahharūn, who can e ither be construed as angels h ere or alternatively as\nthe inhabitants of paradise (Davitashvili 2021, 67, n. 219); and in Q 80:13–14, the “sheets”\nof the Qur’an’s celestial archetype are themselves called “purified,” muṭahharah (cf. also\nQ 98:1). In sum, t here is substantial Qur’anic evidence for use of the verb ṭahhara and\nits passive participle muṭahhar to describe a general state of agreeability and closeness\nto God. To call the believers’ spouses “purified,” then, is most likely not a reference to\nthe removal of par tic u lar female bodily functions, but simply affirms that the believers’\nspouses are worthy of residing in God’s presence, of being “brought near” (qarraba; see\nalso under → dhabaḥa) to God like other denizens of paradise (cf. the designation of the\nblessed, or a subcategory of them, as “t hose brought near” or “t hose allowed to come\nnear,” al- muqarrabūn, in Q 56:11.88 and 83:21.28).\nEarthly wives must gain entry to paradise on their own merit. Thus construed, the\nMedinan introduction of the attribute “purified” to describe the believers’ spouses in the\nhereafter ties in with the requirement voiced in Q 13:23, 40:8, and 52:21 that family mem-\nbers admitted to paradise must themselves have believed in God and have led a right eous\nlife. This demand obviously opens up the possibility that some earthly spouses may not\nmeet the criteria for entry to paradise, a situation that is expressly envisaged in Q 66:10–11:\nthe wives of Noah and Lot, two of God’s right eous servants, will be sentenced to dam-\nnation, while the wife of Pha raoh, an archetypal unbeliever and sinner, aspires to gain\nadmission to paradise.5 Against this background, one may surmise that the promise of\n“purified” other- worldly spouses in Q 2:25, 3:15, and 4:57 aims to reassure believers that\neven if their this-w orldly spouses do not reach the moral threshold for entry to paradise\nthey will nonetheless experience conjugal happiness in the afterlife. Clearly, wives who\nhave proven themselves to be righ teous in their earthly lives will be re united with their\nhusbands, provided the latter are equally worthy of eschatological reward. One may fur-\nther conjecture that husbands whose wives fail the criterion of righ teousness laid down\n5 One Qur’anic version of the Noah narrative illustrates how not only spouses but also descendants can fall\nshort of the requirement of right eousness and belief that Q 13:23, 40:8, and 52:21 stipulate for entry to paradise:\naccording to Q 11:40–48, Noah had a son who preferred to seek refuge from the flood on a mountain rather than\nboarding his father’s ark and abjuring unbelief, and who drowned as a result. See also Q 46:17–18, which speaks\nin general terms about conflict between believing parents and an unbelieving child, and cf. Q 29:8 and 31:14–15\n(discussed under → jāhada), where it is the parents who are unbelievers.

The verb ẓalama—on which see generally CDKA 178–179\nand Christiansen 2016—is “one of the most impor tant negative value words in the Qurʾān”\n(ERCQ 164), occurring over a hundred times from the early Meccan to the Medinan pe-\nriod. Ẓalama is already attested in Safaitic (Al- Jallad 2015a, 355) and, like the noun ẓulm,\nin ancient Arabic poetry (e.g., DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 1:3–4). In the Qur’an, the verb and\nthe noun are normally applied to humans, as in the plural phrase “ those who are guilty of\nwrongdoing” (alladhīna ẓalamū; e.g., Q 2:59.150.165, 51:59, 52:47). In addition, the Qur’an\ncontains statements denying that God can be an agent or patient of ẓulm, which will form\nthe object of special attention below. These statements are in turned linked to a reflexive\nuse of ẓalama in the expression “to wrong oneself” (ẓalama nafsahu), which will also be\naddressed later in this entry.\nAccording to Izutsu and Reinhart, the core meaning of ẓalama in the Qur’an is “to\nencroach upon the right of another person” (ERCQ 165) or “undeserved conduct vis-à -\nvis another” (Reinhart 2002, 64). This makes “to wrong s.o.” an apt En glish rendering, to\nwhich I shall largely adhere throughout. Some premodern lexicographers posit an even\nmore basic sense, namely, to put something in the wrong place (see, e.g., AEL 1920; cf.\nERCQ 164–165 and Hourani 1985, 30). But the paraphrases just cited from Izutsu and\nReinhart adequately account for many Qur’anic occurrences of ẓalama and ẓulm and\ntherefore provide a valid point of departure. For instance, the theft of the king’s goblet in\nthe story of Joseph is classed as an act of ẓulm or wrongdoing (Q 12:75; ERCQ 166), and\nsome passages refer to the followers of Muhammad as having been “wronged” by their\nadversaries (Q 16:41, 22:39, 26:227). Now, wronging somebody, in the sense of violating\nhis or her rights, w ill usually involve inflicting a ctual harm or injury upon the victim, and\nthe verb ẓalama indeed appears to encompass both semantic aspects, that of wronging\n500", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:523", "title": "Page 523", "locator": "pdf_page:523", "text": "and that of harming (Hourani 1985, 30 and 55–56). In accordance with this, Muhammad’s\nfollowers are said to have been “wronged” in so far as they have been “unjustly expelled\nfrom their abodes” merely on account of professing belief in God (Q 22:39–40; see also\nunder → jāhada). The sense of concrete harm is particularly palpable at Q 18:33, where the\nverb ẓalama is exceptionally not employed in the context of an interaction between moral\nagents (Hourani 1985, 55): two gardens are said to have “yielded their produce, not caus-\ning any of it to come to harm” or, more freely, to have “yielded their produce unblighted”\n(ātat ukulahā wa- lam taẓlim minhu shayʾan). As will become clear below, bearing in mind\nthis potential double meaning, of wronging and injuring, is vital to making good sense of\nsome of the word’s uses in the Qur’an. Whether one or the other of the two senses just\ndistinguished is primary may be left undecided here.\nIf ẓalama is to violate what is due to another, in par tic u lar to another person, then the\ntransitive use of the verb with an accusative object, referring to the victim, is semantically\nbasic (e.g., Q 38:24, 42:42). But in the Qur’an, there is not invariably an obvious victim of\nẓulm, or at least an obvious human victim. For example, Abraham’s idolatrous compatriots\ndescribe the destruction of their gods as an act of ẓulm (Q 21:59; cf. ERCQ 168). One might\nsubmit that the implied victims h ere are the broken idols or their worshippers; but it is\nmore likely that ẓalama can at least on occasion simply designate any action that is deemed\nto breach a valid moral or religious norm, whether or not this amounts to wronging or\ninjuring any par tic ul ar h uman other. Thus, ẓalama can simply have the force of committing\nan evil or sinful act, a sense adequately captured by the En glish expression “to do wrong,\nto be guilty of wrongdoing” (cf. Christiansen 2020, 98).\nGod does not wrongfully injure humans; rather, h umans injure themselves. Many\nQur’anic passages deny that God does or might inflict wrong (verb: ẓalama) upon h umans\n(ERCQ 165–166). For instance, God “does not intend to wrong the world- dwellers”\n(Q 3:108: wa- mā llāhu yurīdu ẓulman li- l- ʿālamīn; see also 40:31), he does not “inflict\nwrong on his servants” (Q 3:182, 8:51, 22:10, 41:46, 50:29: laysa bi-ẓ allāmin li- l-ʿ abīd), and\nno one will be wronged on the day of judgement (e.g., Q 2:281, 3:25, 21:47, 43:76, 45:22,\n46:19). According to Q 6:131, if and when God destroys towns he does not do so “wrong-\nfully” (bi-ẓ ulmin; similarly Q 11:117). The animating concern in all of t hese verses is clearly\nto uphold the immaculate justice that characterises the divine judge. While the under lying\nissue is, broadly speaking, to reconcile human sufering with divine justice, the Qur’an is\nnot treating the prob lem of theodicy in its customary sense here, for the sufering at hand\nis generally not the pre sent inner- worldly sufering that is an ineluctable feature of human\nexperience (e.g., illness, famines and natu ral disasters, or other mis haps resulting in death\nor injury) but rather the anticipated eschatological sufering of the wicked.1\nOf course, the Qur’anic God unleashes not only eschatological but also inner- historical\npunishment (see u nder → ʿadhdhaba). This means that the Qur’anic denial of divine wrong-\ndoing also encompasses certain past acts of inner-w orldly devastation, such as the flood\nthat wiped out t hose who rejected the preaching of Noah. Among the verses cited e arlier,\nthose in which this pre- eschatological dimension is in the foreground include Q 40:31,\nwhere the assertion that God does not wrong his servants comes directly a fter a reference\nto the people of Noah and other victims of divine retribution in the past (see also, e.g.,\nQ 9:70). Similarly, Q 6:131 speaks of God’s destruction of towns prior to the final judgement\n1 On famine in the Qur’an, see Waines 2002; on sufering in general, see Heemskerk 2006.\nẓalama 501", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But apart from such cataclysmic acts of divine retribution in the\npast, what the Qur’an has to say about human sufering in the pre- eschatological world is\noften limited to the contention that adversity is something by which God tests (→ balā,\nablā, ibtalā) humans or by which he realises other unfathomable purposes and which\ntherefore ought to be steadfastly endured (e.g., Q 21:35, 31:17; see also u nder → ṣabara).2\nGenerally speaking, the core aspect of the prob lem of theodicy as conventionally posed—\nnamely, how can an omnipotent and supremely good creator allow or, worse yet, di-\nrectly cause those types of sufering and pain that cannot be explained as resulting from\nunconstrained human choice?—is “warded of” by the Qur’an, as Hans Zirker has put it\n(Zirker 1993, 204–220): God “is not interrogated about what he does,” in contrast to his\nhuman creatures (Q 21:23).3 Such a principled rejection of theodicean doubt is linked\nto the Qur’an’s far- reaching stance of cosmic affirmation: God’s creation is categorically\ndeclared to be free from any defects (Q 67:3–4; see also under → khalaqa and → afsada).\nEven the fact that the human social order is marked by systemic inequalities that cannot\nbe rationalised in terms of antecedent desert is unapologetically attributed to God and is\nin no way treated as incompatible with his goodness or justice (e.g., Q 6:165; see in more\ndetail under → darajah). The notion of wrongdoing, in any case, is not salient in the context\nof such Qur’anic statements of broadly theodicean purport, with the one exception noted\nearlier (past acts of inner- worldly divine punishment).\nDenials of divine wrongdoing of the sort referenced above can be accompanied by the\naddition that it is rather sinful h umans who “wrong themselves” (e.g., Q 9:70, 3:117, 11:101,\n16:118, 30:9), namely, by incurring God’s just reckoning: what ever retribution God exacts\nis no wrongful torment imposed by a cruel despot but rather the appropriate penalty for\nprior human misdeeds (see also u nder → al- raḥmān and → makara). As George F. Hou-\nrani has argued, “wronging oneself” is best understood in the specific sense of hurting,\nharming, or injuring oneself rather than in the sense of inflicting injustice upon oneself,\nwhich would be conceptually puzzling if taken literally (Hourani 1985).4 An appropriate\nparaphrase of the affirmations of h uman self- wronging at hand would therefore be this:\nGod does not wrongly injure humans; rather, what ever injury humans sufer at the hands of\nthe divine judge is entirely deserved and ultimately self-i nflicted. Given the Qur’anic posit\nof a universal and omnipotent divine judge, any h uman act of wrongdoing will ultimately\ncause injury to the ofending agent himself or herself. Elsewhere, too, this point is made by\n2 Some Qur’anic passages intimate a dif er ent position than the one just adumbrated, by casting afflication\nand misfortune as forms of divine retribution rather than a divine test. Such a penal construal of sufering is\nput forward most explic itly in Q 42:30, affirming that “what ever misfortune befalls youp (mā aṣābakum min\nmuṣībatin) is on account of what your hands have accrued; still, he [God] forgives much” (see also Q 3:165 and\n4:79). If Q 42:30 is taken as a universal gloss on the full panoply of human misery and sufering, it is difficult to\nsee how it could be reconciled with the exceedingly plausible contention that at least in some cases it is innocent\npersons who sufer, a claim that would seem to be presupposed both by the Qur’an’s portrayal of Job and by the\nQur’anic concept of sufering as a divine test.\n3 See also the discussion of Q 18:65–82 u nder → ḥikmah and Alexander 2006, 380, who remarks that in\ncomparison to the Biblical book of Job the corresponding Qur’anic accounts (Q 21:83–84, 38:41–44) are not\n“plagued by the prob lem of theodicy” and that the Qur’anic Job never attributes his sufering directly to God.\nCharles Taylor notes that the prob lem of theodicy becomes more acute if t here is an assumption that the pur-\nposes God is seeking to achieve are open to detailed explication, making it pos si ble to mea sure the actual order\nof things against the ultimate aims pursued (Taylor 2007, 306). The Qur’an certainly preserves a clear sense that\nGod’s objectives, while indubitably merciful, just, and wise, are not fully amenable to h uman comprehension.\n4 I shall nonetheless translate ẓalama nafsahu as “to wrong oneself” rather than as “to injure oneself,” in\norder to signal that the same Arabic word is being used as in non- reflexive instances of ẓalama.\n502 ẓalama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Such reflexive language throws into relief one of\nthe Qur’an’s most fundamental approaches to justifying its moral and religious demands,\nan approach aptly characterised as “prudential” (Reinhart 2002, 57, 58): an impor tant\nmotive for moral behaviour is eschatologically enlightened self- concern.\nAgainst the preceding background, the expression “to wrong/injure oneself” (ẓalama\nnafsahu) can simply function as a casual synonym for transgressing against God’s moral\nexpectations. This is well illustrated by Q 3:135, which speaks of p eople who “commit an\nabomination or wrong themselves” (wa- lladhīna idhā faʿalū fāḥishatan aw ẓalamū anfusa-\nhum), and by Q 4:110, referring to “the one who commits an evil act or wrongs himself” (man\nyaʿmal sūʾan aw yaẓlim nafsahu). Similarly, when Q 37:113 underscores that the descendants\nof Abraham and Isaac are a mixed bag including right eous and sinful individuals, it is taken\nfor granted that the latter are not just wrongdoers but inflicters of wrong upon themselves (wa-\nmin dhurriyyatihimā muḥsinun wa-ẓ ālimun li- nafsihī mubīn); and Q 9:36 describes violation\nof the sacred months (see u nder → ḥarrama) as self-w ronging. The firm presupposition that\nanybody guilty of wrongdoing is ultimately self-h arming can, moreover, be seen at Q 7:23,\nwhere Adam and Eve ask for God’s forgiveness by saying, “Our Lord, we have wronged\nourselves,” which has the same communicative purport as “Our Lord, we have sinned.”\nA singular version of the same formula of confession— namely, “I have wronged myself”\n(ẓalamtu nafsī)—is uttered by the queen of Sabaʾ (Q 27:44) and by Moses a fter having killed\nan Egyptian who quarrelled with a fellow Israelite (Q 28:16). In none of t hese three places,\nit may again be noted, is t here any sense that the protagonists are displaying an unduly self-\ncentred concern with their own prospects: “wronging oneself” simply means committing\na sinful act for which one is liable to divine punishment.\nCan God suffer ẓulm? As noted above, not all acts of ẓulm in the Qur’an have an obvi-\nous human victim. For example, Adam and Eve are told that approaching the forbidden\ntree would make them wrongdoers (Q 2:35, 7:19: wa-l ā taqrabā hādhihi l- shajarata fa-\ntakūnā mina l-ẓ ālimīn). Here, t here are no other humans around who might be wronged\nby Adam and Eve’s action, and the wrong in question consists entirely in disobeying an\nunequivocal divine command. Elsewhere it is made clear that the most egregious case\nof ẓulm is in fact for someone to “fabricate (verb: iftarā) lies against God and dismiss\n(verb: → kadhdhaba) his signs (singular: → āyah) as a lie” (Q 6:21; cf. the similar man\naẓlamu questions at 6:93.144.157, 7:37, 10:17, 11:18, 18:15.57, 29:68, 32:22, 39:32, 61:7, and\nsee ERCQ 170). Associating another being with God (shirk; see under → ashraka), too, is\nclassed as wrongdoing (Q 31:13; cf. 5:72 and 35:40), and so is the Israelites’ worship of the\nGolden Calf (Q 2:51.54.92, 7:148). Moreover, two Medinan verses, Q 2:229 and 65:1, link\nẓulm with transgression of “God’s bound aries” (ḥudūd allāh) in the context of divorce (see\nalso ERCQ 167): even wronging another person, it would seem, is here cast as an ofence\nagainst God, who functions as the ultimate arbiter and guarantor of what humans owe to\none another.\nFrom passages like the preceding, it might be inferred that the wronged party in such\ncases must be God. Yet, as highlighted earlier, ẓalama has distinct connotations of inflict-\ning harm and injury. One can therefore appreciate why it would have been theologically\nproblematic to envisage God as an object of the act of ẓulm: surely God is too lofty to\nẓalama 503", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is the second purpose for which the\nQur’an employs the reflexive phrase “to wrong oneself” (ẓalama nafsahu): according to\nQ 2:57 and 7:160, the waywardness and obstinacy of the Mosaic Israelites did not inflict\nharm upon God but simply rebounded upon the Israelites themselves (wa- mā ẓalamūnā wa-\nlākin kānū anfusahum yaẓlimūn). In line with this, Q 2:54 calls the Israelites’ worship of the\nGolden Calf not just an act of wrongdoing, like 2:51.92 and 7:148, but an act of self-w ronging.\nLike Surah 2, Q 7:160 may well date to the Medinan period (see under → al- asbāṭ); given\nthat the first use of the reflexive formulation “to wrong oneself,” serving to exculpate God\nfrom the suspicion of wrongdoing, is already found in Meccan surahs (e.g., Q 30:9), the\nway the expression is deployed in Q 2:57 and 7:160 is almost certainly a chronologically\nsecondary variation on its e arlier exculpating use. It deserves further thought why it was\nspecifically God’s interaction with the Mosaic Israelites that triggered this adaptation of\nan established Meccan phrase. Possibly, the objective is to counteract the impression that\nGod’s forbearance in the face of serial Israelite insubordination and disobedience is due to\na profound attachment to the Israelites in par tic ul ar, an attachment making God vulner-\nable to rejection by his chosen p eople. Such a reading is supported by Q 5:18, discussed\nunder → allāh, which criticises the alleged claim of the Jews and Christians to be “God’s\nchildren and beloved ones.”\nSummarising the pre sent section and the preceding one, we may say that the Qur’anic\ncorpus taken as a synchronic w hole strongly suggests that acts of ẓulm or wrongdoing\ncannot, as it w ere, cross over between the divine sphere and the h uman one: God will not\nwrong, or wrongly injure, humans, even though he does subject sinners to eschatological\ntorment; and h umans cannot wrong God in the sense of harming him, even if in some sense\nany h uman transgression is an ofence against the deity. The reflexive expression “to wrong\noneself” (ẓalama nafsahu) plays an impor tant role in articulating both parts of the preced-\ning statement. The expression thus contributes to a Qur’anic propensity to set God apart\nfrom his creatures and to uphold his singular and untouchable majesty (which does not\npreclude the simultaneous assertion of meaningful interaction between God and humans).\nDenials of divine wrongdoing and the general issue of God’s justice. The Qur’an’s\nrecurrent disavowal that God could be an agent of wrongdoing illustrates a general pro-\nclivity observed by Majid Fakhry, namely, the Qur’anic tendency to articulate God’s justice\nin negative terms rather than by employing positive attributes meaning “just” (Fakhry\n1994, 14–15; see also van Ess 2017–2020, 4:565). Th ere is indeed a striking contrast h ere\nwith the frequent use of adjectival predicates for other divine traits, like “wise” (ḥakīm;\nsee under → ḥikmah) or “endowed with power” (→ qadīr). Yet this stylistic predilection,\nhowever it is to be explained, does not call into doubt that justice is nonetheless a core facet\n5 Izutsu maintains that Q 5:39 speaks of ẓulm committed against God (ERCQ 166), but this is not compel-\nling. The infraction in question is theft, as in Q 12:75, and it is not made explicit that the victim of the wrong in\nquestion is God rather than the person stolen from; note that the suffix in ẓulmihi almost certainly refers to the\nagent, not the patient (which Izutsu seems to accept). See also Reinhart 2002, 64, who distinguishes between\nwronging God in the sense of “ doing wrong by him,” and harming him.\n504 ẓalama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It must also be noted that the Qur’an does in fact char-\nacterise God’s retributive and compensatory activity by means of affirmative statements,\ne.g., by using verbs like waffā (“to repay in full”) and ḥāsaba (“to call to account”), which\nare just as suggestive of divine justice and equity as negations comprising the verb ẓalama\n(see further under → ḥisāb). The issue at hand, then, is not so much whether God’s justice\nis described in affirmative terms or in negative ones but rather whether it is described in\nterms of seemingly static divine properties (what God is) as opposed to divine actions\n(what God does, or what he does not do).\nLater theologians make the Qur’anic stress on divine justice explicit by recourse to\nderivatives of the root ʿ- d- l, especially the noun ʿadl, “justice.” In the Qur’an, by contrast,\nthe word ʿadl and the verb ʿadala (“to act justly”) generally qualify interactions among\nhumans (e.g., Q 2:282, 4:3.58.129, 5:8) rather than designating an immanent trait of the\ndeity, even though according to Q 16:90 it is God who “enjoins justice” (yaʾmuru bi- l-ʿ adli)\nand 6:115 declares that “God’s word is perfectly truthful and just” (wa- tammat kalimatu\nrabbika ṣidqan wa- ʿadlan). A predominant application to humans rather than to God also\nholds true for the verb aqsaṭa (“to be fair or equitable”; e.g., Q 4:3) and the noun qisṭ\n(“fairness, equity”; e.g., Q 3:21; see also u nder → maʿrūf). Still, Q 10:4.47.54 affirm that\nGod judges “fairly” (bi- l- qisṭi), while 3:18 describes God as someone who “upholds fairness”\n(qāʾiman bi- l- qisṭi; cf. also Q 21:47). However, even in the case of t hese latter passages the\nQur’anic focus, unlike that of l ater theologians, is on justice as something that God enacts\nrather than on justice as an inherent divine property. The relative lack of explicit Qur’anic\naffirmations that God is just, as opposed to behaving or proceeding justly, may therefore\nbe reflective of the fact that the Qur’an envisages God as a personal agent rather than as\na metaphysical substance characterised by attributes; accordingly, the certainty that God\nwill exhibit and enact justice is grounded in interpersonal trust (see also under → ṣabara)\nrather than in God being the equivalent of an object possessing fixed properties and pre-\ndictable dispositions.6\nẓulumāt pl. | darkness\n→ allāh\nẓann | conjecture, speculation, opinion\n→ tabiʿa\n6 On the personal nature of the Qur’anic God, see further under → allāh.\nẓann 505", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Moral testing being the supreme purpose of divine creation (→ balā), God difer-\nentially responds to h umans’ right eous and evil deeds by rewards (→ ajr) and punishments,\nboth in this world and the next. The most prominent Qur’anic terms expressing divine\npunishment in all its shapes are the noun ʿadhāb and the corresponding verb ʿadhdhaba,\n“to torment, to punish.” Q 38:41 exceptionally speaks of the ʿadhāb that Satan has inflicted\non Job; reference h ere is clearly to the hardship and adversity sufered by Job, which makes\n“torment” the contextually appropriate translation. But normally, the words ʿadhāb and\nʿadhdhaba figure in connection with divine retribution, w hether in the afterlife or in the\npre sent world (e.g., Q 52:47; see in more detail below). In most cases, ʿādhab and ʿadhdhaba\ncan therefore defensibly be rendered as “punishment” and “to punish” or perhaps, following\nArberry 1955, as “chastisement” and “to chastise.”1 It is especially in verses like Q 52:47,\nwhich employ ʿadhāb to refer to a pre- eschatological act of swift divine chastisement, that\ntranslating ʿadhāb as “torment” rather than “punishment” would be ungainly. At the same\ntime, a careful translator may wish to avoid using “punishment”/”to punish” for both ʿādhab\nand ʿadhdhaba, on the one hand, and for ʿiqāb, “retaliation, punishment” (e.g., Q 2:196.211,\n3:11), and its corresponding verb ʿāqaba, “to retaliate” (Q 16:126, 22:60, 60:11), on the other.2\nʿĀdhab and ʿadhdhaba largely parallel the Syriac verbs shanneq and aḥḥesh, as used, for\ninstance, in descriptions of hell by Ephrem (Beck 1970a, no. 5:256.264.281.288; for further\nreferences, see Sinai 2017a, 264), and nouns like tashnīqā (see Matt 25:46, where this is the\nPeshitta’s rendering of Greek kolasis; see also El-B adawi 2014, 193–195) and shūnāqā (Beck\n1970a, no. 6:45, which has the plural). Of course, t hese equivalences do not call into doubt\nthe fact that ʿadhāb and ʿadhdhaba are native Arabic terms.3 Lexically more difficult than\nʿadhāb is its partial synomym → rijz/rujz, which is discussed in a separate entry.\n1 But Arberry also has “to chastise” for ʿāqaba; see his rendering of Q 16:126 and 22:60.\n2 At Q 16:126 and 22:60, the phrase ʿāqaba bi- mithli mā ʿūqiba must be treated as an idiom meaning “to\npunish in accordance with what one has previously sufered” or better yet “to retaliate proportionately” (KK\n295 and Paret 2001, on Q 16:126 and 22:60; cf. Abdel Haleem 2010, 174). By contrast, a literal translation such as\n“to punish as one has been punished” (e.g., Jones 2007, 260) seems contextually inappropriate, since it would\nimply that the injury previously sufered was itself inflicted by way of punishment.\n3 The verb ʿadhdhaba, with God as the grammatical subject, occurs in a poetic fragment attributed to Uma-\nyyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt (Schulthess 1911a, no. 28:6 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 69:6) that previous scholarship has tended to\nconsider au then tic (Seidensticker 2011b, 49–50).\nʿadhdhaba 507", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In the Qur’an, divine retribution takes two general\nforms, a pre- eschatological or inner-h istorical one and an eschatological one. To begin\nwith the former, the Meccan surahs’ so- called punishment narratives (on which see KU\n10–32 and Marshall 1999) recount how God castigated and destroyed vari ous sinful and\nunbelieving communities in the past, such as the people of Noah, ʿĀd and Thamūd, the\npeople of Lot, and the Egyptians under Phar aoh (e.g., Q 54:9–42). These inner- historical\nor temporal acts of divine devastation come in a variety of guises, some of which are cata-\nlogued in Q 29:40: “Each one of them we seized for his misdeeds; against some of them we\nsent a storm of pebbles (ḥāṣib); some of them were seized by the cry (al-ṣ ayḥah); some of\nthem we caused to be swallowed up by the earth (wa- minhum man khasafnā bihi l- arḍa);\nand some of them we drowned.” Stories about temporal or pre- eschatological punishments\nare not mere recollections of past events but have a con temporary significance, in so far as\nMuhammad’s contemporaries too are sometimes cautioned that they may be struck down\nlike ʿĀd or Thamūd (Q 41:13), be swallowed up by the earth (Q 16:45, 67:16), or fall victim\nto a storm of pebbles (Q 67:17; see Marshall 1999, 53–62, and KU 30–31).\nIn addition to such inner-h istorical or, as one might say, temporal divine punishments,\nGod will also hold a universal eschatological judgement (→ dīn1) of the resurrected at the\nend of the world, leading to eternal reward of the pious in paradise and eternal torment of\nthe sinners and unbelievers in hell (HCI 162–169; → ajr, → jannah, → jahannam, → kha-\nlada). God’s eschatological retribution—s ometimes called the “punishment of the fire”\n(Q 2:126.201, 3:16.191, 8:14, 32:20, 34:42, 59:3: ʿadhāb al- nār), the “punishment of burn-\ning” (Q 3:181, 8:50, 22:9.22, 85:10: ʿadhāb al- ḥarīq),4 or the “punishment of the blaze”\n(Q 22:4, 31:21, 34:12, 67:5: ʿadhāb al-s aʿīr)—is described in considerable and gruesome\ndetail throughout the Qur’an (for an overview, see Gwynne 2002). Literary parallels be-\ntween the Qur’anic portrayal of par tic ul ar inner-w orldly punishments and God’s universal\neschatological reckoning throw into relief that the former prefigure and anticipate the\nlatter, thereby demonstrating God’s total power to inflict devastation and sufering on\nthose who spurn him and his messengers (KU 31–32; Marshall 1999, 62–65; HCI 171–172).\nThe distinction between temporal and eschatological punishment is terminologically\nexplicit from the early Meccan period onwards. For instance, Q 52:45–47 threatens the\nopponents with “a day on which their cunning w ill avail them nothing and they w ill have\nno help” (v. 46), which must refer to the eschatological day of universal judgement. In\naddition, the “wrongdoers” are then assured of “a punishment before this” (v. 47: wa-\ninna li- lladhīna ẓalamū ʿadhāban dūna dhālika), which would seem to be a limited inner-\nhistorical chastisement similar to those that annihilated ʿĀd or Thamūd.5 Another early\nMeccan verse, Q 68:33, concludes an account of how God disciplined a group called the\n“garden- owners” (aṣḥāb al- jannah; Q 68:17)—w hich is clearly not a reference to the garden\nof paradise—by devastating their crops: “Such is the punishment; and the final punish-\nment (ʿadhāb al-ā khirah) is greater, if only they knew!” Q 88:23–24 similarly announces\nthat those who “turn away” from God’s message and “repudiate” it will fall victim to “the\ngreater punishment” (v. 24: fa- yuʿadhdhibuhu llāhu l-ʿ adhāba l- akbar). In the l ater Mec-\ncan verse Q 32:21 the divine voice declares that “we shall make them taste the proximate\n4 As noted in O’Shaughnessy 1961, 445, ʿadhāb al-ḥ arīq is limited to Medinan surahs.\n5 On the temporal function of dūna in Q 52:47 and also in 32:21, cited further along in the main text, see\nAmbros 2001, 9.\n508 ʿadhdhaba", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Similar terminology recurs in Q 41:16, contrasting “the punishment of humiliation\nin the proximate life” (ʿadhāb al-k hizyi fī l-ḥ ayāti l-d unyā) and the even more humiliating\n“final punishment” (ʿadhāb al-ā khirah). Echoing Q 39:26, just cited, a number of Medinan\nverses formulaically announce to vario us kinds of sinners or opponents that “theirs will\nbe humiliation in the proximate life and a mighty punishment in the hereafter” (Q 2:114,\n5:33.41: lahum fī l- dunyā khizyun / lahum khizyun fī l- dunyā wa- lahum fī l-ā khirati ʿadhābun\nʿaẓīm; similarly 2:85 and 22:9). Announcements of double punishment in the pre sent\nworld and the hereafter are found in other verses too, both Meccan and Medinan (Q 3:56,\n9:74, 13:34; cf. also the contrast between a “humiliating” and a “lasting” punishment in\n11:39 and 39:40).6\nMore on the relationship between this- worldly and eschatological punishment.\nSome further remarks on the relationship between temporal and eschatological punish-\nment may be added. First, double threats of humiliation in this life and eschatological\npunishment in the hereafter make it clear that sufering an inner- worldly cataclysm does\nnot have any purgatory efect, whereby a malefactor might be deemed to have served\nat least part of his eschatological sentence. For example, Phar aoh and his adherents are\npunished by drowning, but he w ill also “precede his p eople on the day of resurrection\nand lead them into the fire” (Q 11:98; KU 32). Secondly, it is not always clear whether the\nMeccan surahs threaten Muhammad’s antagonists with the end of the world and judge-\nment day itself (e.g., 54:1, 70:6–7; see HCI 164) or only with “a thunderbolt like the thun-\nderbolt of ʿĀd and Thamūd” (Q 41:13: fa-q ul andhartukum ṣāʿiqatan mithla ṣāʿiqati ʿādin\nwa- thamūd), that is, with a spatially limited inner- worldly calamity. Such ambivalence\nwould not as such have posed a doctrinal difficulty, though the fact that over time neither\nthe former nor the latter kind of punishment materialised certainly did amount to a grave\ntheological challenge (Saleh 2016; HCI 179–180). This dilemma then entailed, thirdly, a\nsignificant theological re orientation in the Qur’an’s Medinan stratum, according to which\nGod’s temporal punishment was now considered to be delivered by the militant actions\nof the believers rather than in the form of a thunderbolt, a storm of pebbles, a deluge, or\nthe like (Marshall 1999, 153–157; → jāhada).\nA fourth and final remark concerns the fact that “whereas the Last Day is a fixed and im-\nmovable real ity for all p eople, divine punishment in this world is not inevitable” (Marshall\n1999, 63). In other words, temporal punishments can be averted and delayed by h uman\ncontrition and repentance (see also under → ajal). This possibility is represented by the\npeople of Jonah, who respond to the preaching of the messenger sent to them by espousing\nbelief, upon which God “grants them enjoyment until a certain time” (Q 37:148: fa-ā manū\nfa- mattaʿnāhum ilā ḥīn). A later and more elaborate variant on this outcome stresses the\nexceptional nature of Jonah’s missionary success (Q 10:98): “Why was t here no settlement\n6 For the link between punishment and humiliation, see also Q 9:14 and 11:93.\nʿadhdhaba 509", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

However, once God’s punishment has fully become manifest, any fur-\nther promises of penitence and pleas for forgiveness will be fruitless. This is exemplified\nby the fate of Pha raoh, who professes belief in God in the face of his impending death,\nyet whose conversion in extremis is deemed to have come too late (Q 10:90–92; see Sinai\n2019a, especially 248–250).\nʿarabī | Arabic\nFurther vocabulary discussed: qurʾān | recitation aʿjamī | non- Arabophone, for-\neign f aṣṣala tr.

From a certain point in the Meccan period, a cluster of verses joins the noun\nqurʾān, “recitation,” an impor tant Qur’anic self- descriptor (→ qaraʾa), with the attribute\nʿarabī (see generally Wild 2006b). One example is Q 43:3: “We have made it an ʿarabī\nrecitation (innā jaʿalnāhu qurʾānan ʿarabiyyan) so that youp might understand (laʿallakum\ntaʿqilūn).” Similar references to an “ʿarabī recitation” (always in the accusative) occur in\nQ 12:2, 20:113, 39:28 (on which see Al- Jallad 2020c, 75), 41:3, and 42:7. Q 41:44 introduces\nthe adjective aʿjamī as an ostensible contradictory of ʿarabī, by counterfactually envisaging\nwhat the addressees’ response might have been had God “made it an aʿjamī recitation” (wa- law\njaʿalnāhu qurʾānan aʿjamiyyan): they would have said, “Why have its signs not been clearly\nset out?” (law-l ā fuṣṣilat āyātuhu; see u nder → faṣṣala), and would have inquired, “aʿjamī and\nʿarabī?” (a-a ʿjamiyyun wa-ʿ arabiyyun), meaning perhaps “A message that is aʿjamī and a mes-\nsenger who speaks, or who ought to speak, ʿarabī?” (cf. Ṭab. 20:446–448 and Jal. 1700).1\nQ 13:37 varies the foregoing pattern by saying that God sent “it down as an ʿarabī judgement”\n(wa- ka- dhālika anzalnāhu ḥukman ʿarabiyyan) rather than as an ʿarabī recitation.\n7 A variant of the phrase mattaʿa + acc. ilā ḥīn occurs in Q 51:43 (tamattaʿū ḥattā ḥīn, “enjoy yourselves until\na certain time”) in the context of the story of Thamūd, where it does not describe the positive consequences of\nmissionary success but rather serves to emphasise that the addressees will receive their deserved punishment\neven if the latter may only materialise after a slight delay. A nominal variant of the phrase mattaʿa + acc. ilā ḥīn\nis found in Q 2:36, 7:24, 16:80, 21:111, and 36:44, according to which God granted or grants humans matāʿ ilā\nḥīn, “enjoyment until a certain time.” The contextual emphasis in Q 21:111 is close to 51:43, since the Messenger\nsuggests to his adversaries that the failure of God’s punishment to materialise might simply be a temporary (and\nundeserved) extension that does not alter the prospect of an impending punishment. In the other verses just\nreferenced, the fact that God has assigned to h umans “enjoyment u ntil a certain time” articulates the general\nfact that all human existence is what one might call being- towards- a- term, a circumstance that the Qur’an also\nexpresses by using the noun → ajal, “term.”\n1 For a dif er ent interpretation, see Al- Jallad 2020c, 76.\n510 ʿarabī", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Fi nally, Q 46:12 contains another self- referential statement\nto the efect that “this is a scripture that confirms”— namely, confirms the “scripture of\nMoses” mentioned immediately beforehand— “in ʿarabī language” (wa-h ādhā kitābun\nmuṣaddiqun lisānan ʿarabiyyan).\nThe purpose clause “so that youp might understand” (laʿallakum taʿqilūn) that sets out the\nreason why God revealed an “ʿarabī recitation” in Q 12:2 and 43:3 is int ere st ing. The “under-\nstanding” at stake h ere is a theologically charged notion that transcends semantic compre-\nhension and amounts to grasping God’s “signs” (singular: āyah) in the world and to being\nheedful of one’s divine creator and ultimate judge (see the remarks on ʿaqala under → āyah\nand → dhakkara as well as → qalb and → laʿalla). At the same time, a precondition for en-\ngendering such religious understanding is evidently that God’s revelation should possess a\nbasic degree of intelligibility (cf. Al- Jallad 2020c, 74). Comprehensibility would also seem to\nbe in focus in Q 16:103 and 26:195, which underline that the Qur’anic revelations are in “clear\nʿarabī language” (lisān ʿarabī mubīn), and in 41:44, which implies that a non-ʿ arabī revelation\nwould not have counted as “clearly set out” (verb: faṣṣala). Though the conclusion is not un-\ndisputed, the preceding observations converge to suggest that the Qur’anic revelations’ being\nʿarabī or “in ʿarabī language” is assumed to facilitate their being understood by the audience\nthey seek to convert. This meshes very well with the general emphasis that many Qur’anic\npassages place on the supreme clarity of divine communication (see under → bayyana).4\nThe following will add further arguments in favour of the traditional position that ʿarabī\nmeans “Arabic,” in the sense of identifying a specific language in opposition to o thers. If this\ninterpretation is correct, then the Meccan surahs attach explicit significance to the fact that\ntheir linguistic medium is Arabic, a language that had not so far served as an established\n2 According to Daniel Birnstiel, when the Qur’an claims to have been revealed bi- lisānin ʿarabiyyin mubīn,\nthis does not mean “in clear Arabic language” but rather “clearly in Arabic language” (Birnstiel 2018, 74: “in a\nlanguage that is recognizably Arabic”). But see the reservations presented under → bayyana.\n3 The expected singular of aʿjamūn would of course be aʿjam rather than aʿjamī, but it seems very safe to\ntreat these two words as equivalent.\n4 The contention that being in ʿarabī language serves to “facilitate understanding linguistically” is expressly\ndenied in Retsö 2003, 47; see further below on his views. Kropp, too, doubts that the reference to “evident Arabic\nlanguage” in Q 16:103 and 26:195 intends comprehensibility. Inspired by Federico Corriente, he detects a parallel\nto Jubilees = VanderKam 1989, ch. 12:25–26, where God teaches Abraham to speak Hebrew, which is literally\ndescribed as a language that is “evident,” apparently in the sense of being “revealed” (see Kropp 2015, 280–282).\nBased on this, Kropp holds that mubīn as used in connection with the language of the Qur’an is a calque from\nEthiopic (Kropp 2015, 286).

This interpretation accords with Ahmad Al-\nJallad’s recent argument that ʿarabī “meant simply the local vernacular language as opposed\nto traditional mono thei stic liturgical idioms” (Al- Jallad 2020c, 73–77, citing 73; cf. also van\nPutten 2022, 217).5 As briefly explained in the entry’s final section, emphasis on the Qur’anic\nrevelations’ Arabicness fades in the Medinan surahs, which attribute a more ecumenical\nremit to Muhammad’s mission.\nDoes ʿarabī mean “Arabic”? The customary rendering of ʿarabī as “Arabic” has not\nescaped questioning, most recently by Peter Webb (Webb 2016, 115–126). Webb demon-\nstrates that pre-I slamic poetry yields only l imited evidence to the efect that the term ʿarab\nfunctioned as a marker of ethnic belonging, and instead suggests that it was the name\nmaʿadd that “emerges as a label of collective identity across pre- Islamic poetry” (Webb\n2016, 60–109, quoting p. 70).6 Whether or not this assessment is correct, the opposition\nbetween the adjectives ʿarabī and aʿjamī as found in Q 16:103 is best interpreted as a di-\nchotomy between speakers of dif er ent languages, with aʿjamī meaning someone who\nspeaks an unintelligible or, as it w ere, barbarian tongue. For Q 26:195–199, too, it makes\ngood sense to construe the contrast between ʿarabī and aʿjamī as a linguistic dichotomy.\nAs concisely summarised above, the passage first declares that Muhammad’s revelations\nare “in clear ʿarabī language” and then entertains how the Qur’an’s hearers would have\nresponded had God’s revelations been conveyed by “one of the aʿjamūn”: they would not\nhave believed in it, v. 199 says, which may be taken to mean that their inability to under-\nstand the preaching of a hy po thet i cal aʿjamī messenger would have impaired their ability\nto absorb God’s message (thus also Wild 2006b, 154, against Retsö 2003, 45–46). A fter all,\nthe more explicit objection entertained in the similar counterfactual scenario at Q 41:44\ncentres on the notion that a non- ʿarabī revelation would hot have been “clearly set out”\n(law-l ā fuṣṣilat āyātuhu). Hence, the cumulative logic of Q 16:103, 26:195–199, and 41:44\nis compatible with, and even supportive of, the traditional notion that the aʿjamūn are\n“foreigners” in the sense of speakers of languages other than Arabic, notwithstanding the\nconflicting views of Webb, Matthias Radscheit (Radscheit 1996a, 45–46), and Jan Retsö\n(Retsö 2003, 44–47).7\n5 I became aware of Al- Jallad’s argument and his criticism of Retsö and Webb, which anticipates points also\nmade by me, only while the pre sent volume was already in press.\n6 It is int er est ing to compare Webb’s argument to Hoyland’s deflationary assessment of the scarcity of the\ncategory “Arab” in poetry: “The term is extremely rare in pre- Islamic Arabic poetry, but that may be just b ecause\nthe poets tend mostly to be focusing on their own tribe or allied/rival tribes” (Hoyland 2015, 60).\n7 While in general sympathy with Webb’s sophisticated critique of problematic assumptions about Arab\nethnogenesis, I am unconvinced by his treatment of the Qur’anic opposition between ʿarabī and aʿjamī in Q 16:103\nand also 26:195.198 (Webb 2016, 119): “The Qur’an’s aʿjamī connotes something nonsensical or a sullied message\nof a non- divinely inspired messenger, whereas the verse [= Q 16:103] affirms that ʿarabī connotes a transcendently\nclear koine from God, not a terrestrial vernacular.” Radscheit equates the distinction between ʿarabī and aʿjamī\nwith the general contrast between “intelligible” and “unintelligible” and considers ʿarabī to be pleonastically\nequivalent with mubīn (Radscheit 1996a, 45–46). Jan Retsö denies that Qur’anic aʿjamī means “non- Arabic” in\ntoday’s sense and suggests that the aʿjamī recitation counterfactually envisaged in Q 41:44 is one that “would not\nhave conformed to the demands of the rhymed prose of the ʿarabī language,” based on his view that fuṣṣilat in\nthis verse means “to compose s.th. in rhymed prose” (Retsö 2003, 44–46). Thus, an aʿjamī recitation might well\nbe linguistically Arabic. Retsö concludes that the “purpose of the use of ʿarabī is to authorize the message, not\nto make it linguistically comprehensible” (Retsö 2003, 47), and he thinks that ʿarabī referred not to a language\nin the modern sense but to a special linguistic register that was originally employed in mantic discourse and was\nthus set apart from everyday speech (Retsö 2003, 591–595).

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:535", "title": "Page 535", "locator": "pdf_page:535", "text": "There is an array of supplementary reasons for interpreting the contrast of ʿarabī and\naʿjamī as a linguistic one in the sense just developed. First, the Qur’an shows clear awareness of\na diversity of human languages in Q 30:22 (ikhtilāf alsinatikum; see Wild 2006b, 137), and it\nalso maintains that God “has never sent any messenger except in the language (lisān) of his\npeople” (Q 14:4; cf. 19:97 and 44:58; see Wild 2006b, 153 and 154–155). The conventional\ninterpretation of the ʿarabī vs aʿjamī contrast as pertaining to the use of a specific language\nfits these Qur’anic background assumptions. Secondly, the foregoing understanding of\naʿjamī and aʿjamūn accords with the data rehearsed in the works of Muslim lexicographers,\nfrom which one gathers that the root ʿ- j- m connotes chewing and, by extension, a lack of\nclarity, distinctness, or intelligibility in speech (CDKA 307; AEL 1966–1968). Even if the\nmore specific definitions ofered for words like ʿajam and aʿjam should be taken with a grain\nof salt, their consonantal root does seem to be associated with a consistent basic meaning.8\nThirdly, as noted above, the view that the Meccan surahs draw explicit attention to their\nArabicness coheres with the fact that the textual rec ords of previous scriptures extant at\nthe time of the Qur’an w ere in languages other than Arabic. Fin ally, equating ʿarabī with\n“Arabic” explains not only why statements describing the Qur’anic proclamations as being\nin Arabic would seem to foreground their consequent comprehensibility but also why\nQ 42:7 underscores the Qur’an’s fit with a par tic u lar local or regional context: “Thus have\nwe conveyed an ʿarabī recitation to youS in order that you might warn the mother- town\nand those dwelling around it (li-t undhira umma l-q urā wa-m an ḥawlahā).”9\nNotwithstanding the rarity of the category “Arab” in pre-I slamic poetic discourse, there-\nfore, the Qur’anic data makes it probable that the dichotomy of ʿarab vs ʿajam, which likely\nunderlies the contrast between “the ʿarabī language” and “the aʿjamūn” in Q 26:195.198\nand that between ʿarabī and aʿjamī at Q 16:103 and 41:44, had some currency in the pre-\nIslamic period. At least as far as the dichotomy pre sents itself through the Qur’an, it would\nmost likely have hinged on the contrast between speakers of (some version, or versions,\nof) Old Arabic and kindred idioms, on the one hand, and speakers of languages that w ere\nperceived as substantially dif er ent and not readily intelligible to Arabophones, such as\nGreek or Syriac, on the other. In this sense, Jan Retsö is right to stress that the original\nconcept of Arabness revolved around language rather than kinship and descent (Retsö\n2003, 27–28; similarly Wansbrough 1977, 98), though of course both aspects could have\nbeen seen as closely connected.\nArabness before the Qur’an. The Qur’anic use of ʿarabī is a resonance of ethnic ter-\nminology that had circulated around the Near East for over a millennium by the time of\nMuhammad. The terms “Arab” and “Arabia” are attested in Assyrian inscriptions from the\nninth century BCE onwards and in the Hebrew Bible (see Hoyland 2001, 59–62, and for\nmore detail Retsö 2003, 105–202). Thus, 1 Kgs 10:15 or 2 Chr 9:14 speak of “Arab kings”\nwho paid tribute to Solomon. When the Romans annexed the Nabataean kingdom in 106\nCE, they called the new province “Arabia” (see generally Bowersock 1983). At some point,\ninhabitants of this province may have begun to refer to themselves as “Arabs” (Hoyland\n2015, 22–23; see also Macdonald 2009, 297–303). But instances of Arab self-i dentification\n8 For a detailed discussion of the lexicographic data on ʿajam, ʿajamī, aʿjam, and aʿjamī, see Retsö 2003,\n24–28. As Retsö notes, the distinction that is made between ʿajam and aʿjam seems artificial (Retsö 2003, 26).\n9 See similarly Al- Jallad 2020c, 76. Umm al-q urā is traditionally identified with Mecca, which I see no reason\nto doubt (HCI 40–77). Even less doubtful is the weaker claim that the expression refers to the same settlement\n(balad) that is alluded to in Q 2:126, 14:35, and 90:1–2, wherever one might choose to locate it.\nʿarabī 513", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For instance, according to Gen. Rab.\n87:1 in the language of “Arabia” the word ptyʾ— corresponding to Arabic fatā—is said to\nmean “youth” (Rabin 1951, 117).\nA final piece of evidence to be mentioned in the pre sent context are two recently pub-\nlished Safaitic inscriptions that would seem to employ the word ʾʿrb, without a definite\nmarker, as a group name (Al- Jallad 2020b). Al- Jallad argues against the hypothesis that\nʾʿrb has the generic sense of “nomads” h ere (cf. Arabic aʿrāb; e.g., Q 9:101.120), since one\nwould in this case have expected the word to have the definite article (Al- Jallad 2020b, 427).\nInstead, Al- Jallad remarks that the absence of the definite article is reminiscent of collective\nnames like yhd, “the Jews” (e.g., HAUI 125 and RSIS 324 in Al- Jallad 2015a, 249 and 277), and\nhe concludes that ʾʿrb may have “referred to the broader complex of language and culture”\nthat united the dif er ent tribal groups who produced the Safaitic inscriptions (Al- Jallad\n2020b, 429; cf. Macdonald 2009, 296–297). This would certainly be consistent with the\nhypothesis that the Qur’anic adjective ʿarabī picks out the vernacular linguistic character of\nthe Qur’an and perhaps also reflects a certain awareness of transregional linguistic affinity.\nHowever, it remains salutary to note, with Al- Jallad, that someone endorsing the semantic\nhypothesis defended above— namely, that Qur’anic ʿarabī has a linguistic meaning—is by\nno means committed to the further claim the initial addressees of the Qur’an must therefore\nhave possessed a developed Arab identity in the sense familiar from l ater periods (Al- Jallad\n2020c, 77), i.e., must have prominently self- defined as belonging to the same ethnic and\ncultural collective as other speakers of (some version of) Arabic.\nThe absence of references to the Qur’an’s Arabicness in the Medinan surahs. Remind-\ners of the Arabic nature of the Qur’anic proclamations are l imited to the Meccan surahs\nand do not recur in the Medinan ones. Tracking the Qur’an’s diachronic development, one\nobserves a development leading from references to the ethnic and/or linguistic specificity\nof Muhammad’s revelations in the Meccan surahs to a more universalist emphasis on their\necumenical remit in the Medinan Qur’an—a widening of Muhammad’s constituency that\nis described in more detail elsewhere (see u nder → al-ʿ ālamūn). In this sense, the post-\nQur’anic tension between Islam as God’s dispensation for speakers of Arabic, on the one\nhand, and as a universal religion for humankind at large, on the other, has roots in the Islamic\n10 Th ere is also, of course, the famous Namārah epitaph of one Imruʾ al- Qays ibn ʿAmr, located southeast of\nDamascus, dated to 328 CE, and composed in Arabic but written in the Nabataean script.

Zwettler revises this to “king of the entire\nterritory of ʿArab,” meaning “the extensive cis- and trans- Euphratean region of central and southern Iraq and\nthe eastern Syro- Arabian desert” (Zwettler 1993, 18; see also Macdonald in Fiema et al. 2015, 405–409).

Apart from\nQ 31:17, t hese are all Medinan verses,1 making 31:17—b elonging to Luqmān’s exhortation of\nhis son—t he formula’s chronologically earliest occurrence in the Islamic scripture.\nWhile the maʿrūf-m unkar formula is likely to strike cont emporary readers as a signature\nfeature of Qur’anic diction, early Arabic poetry indicates that the concepts of al- maʿrūf\nand al- munkar were an established part of the moral lexicon of pre- Qur’anic Arabic (see\nalready ERCQ 213–214). For example, a verse from the gnomic final section of Zuhayr’s\nMuʿallaqah recommends shielding and augmenting one’s honour by doing “what is rec-\nognised to be right” (al-m aʿrūf; DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 16:52; see Arberry 1957, 117), and\nthe penultimate verse of a poem from the dīwān of al- Nābighah declares, “God accepts\nonly justice and faithfulness; wrong (al-n ukr) is not right (maʿrūf), and right (al- ʿurf)\nwill not go unrequited (ḍāʾiʿ)” (DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 17:32; see also Sinai 2019b, 45).\nThe second example is particularly intriguing inasmuch as it presupposes the opposition\nof maʿrūf and munkar that is also reflected by the Qur’an (see also ERCQ 216): just as\nal- ʿurf evidently functions as a metrical alternative for maʿrūf, so al-n ukr must be doing\nduty for al-m unkar.2\nOn the putative significance of commanding right and forbidding wrong. Com-\nmanding right and forbidding wrong tend to have a communal dimension in the Qur’an: as\nMichael Cook has observed, in most of the relevant scriptural verses the duty to command\nright and forbid wrong is collectively discharged by the community of believers or by\nsome of the “scripture- owners” (Q 3:104.110.114, 9:71.112, 22:41), while in Q 7:157 it is the\nQur’anic Prophet who engages in commanding right and forbidding wrong towards the\ncommunity of his followers (Cook 2001, 13–14). In the latter case it would make good sense\nto understand the verbs amara and nahā quite literally, as denoting o rders and prohibitions\nthat a person of authority issues to a subordinate, and this is evidently how one ought to\ntranslate amara and nahā in Q 16:90, according to which God “commands (yaʾmuru bi-)\njustice, d oing good, and giving to one’s kin, and forbids (yanhā ʿan) abominations, what is\nreprehensible, and rapaciousness.” Yet in cases where the maʿrūf-m unkar formula is applied\nto the believers at large or to Luqmān’s son (Q 31:17), who is not introduced as possessing\neither po liti cal clout or prophetic authority, amara and nahā would seem to have the\nsense of emphatically urging o thers to act in a certain manner or seeking to dissuade or\nrestrain them from it. As regards amara, this signification is also exemplified by Q 3:21,\nwhich mentions “p eople who enjoin equity (qisṭ)” or who “urge [ others] to be equitable”\n(alladhīna yaʾmurūna bi-l -q isṭi mina l- nāsi; CDKA 27; see also under → ẓalama). Nahā\nin a sense other than literal prohibition is illustrated by Q 29:45: prayer “restrains from\nabominations and what is reprehensible” (tanhā ʿani l- faḥshāʾi wa- l- munkari; see CDKA\n276).3 In general, to say that someone enjoins what is recognised to be right and dissuades\n1 On the Medinan dating of Q 7:157, see under → ummī.\n2 See also Q 7:199, where the command wa- ʾmur bi-l - ʿurfi is perhaps equivalent to wa- ʾmur bi-l -m aʿrūfi.\nIn Q 18:74.87, 54:6, and 65:8, verse- final nukr or nukur may be replacing munkar, albeit in the strong sense of\n“terrible” or “hideous” (see also ERCQ 216–217).\n3 For another passage in which amara bi- and nahā + acc. seem to mean “to enjoin s.th.” and “to restrain s.o.\n(from doing s.th.),” see Q 96:9–10.12.

Is this mission directed at outsiders or rather at other believers? The former is\nsuggested by Q 3:110, which underlines the Qur’anic community’s status as a sort of beacon\nfor humanity at large, “the best community (→ ummah) ever brought forth for people\n(ukhrijat li-l -n āsi), enjoining right and dissuading from wrong.”4 Here and a few verses\nearlier, in Q 3:104, the maʿrūf- munkar formula serves to express the Medinan ummah’s\ndivinely intended function of providing a global role model of piety and righ teousness,\nresembling the Isaian concept that the people of Israel are to be a “light to the nations”\n(see in more detail under → al-ʿ ālamūn). This stress, it should be noted, fits well with the\nsemantics of the root ʾ- m- m, which connotes orientation and guidance (see in more detail\nunder → ummah).\nBut in parallel to the Qur’anic ummah’s function of serving as a collective role model for\nhumanity at large, it is likely that enjoining good and dissuading from wrong also involves\nreciprocal acts of moral counsel, admonishment, and encouragement among the Qur’anic\nbelievers themselves. That the Qur’an considers such mutual moral fortification and cor-\nrection to be vital emerges from Q 90:17 and 103:3, two l ater insertions into early Meccan\nsurahs (PP 156–157 and 238). They portray “ those who believe and do righ teous deeds” as\n“charging one another” (tawāṣā) with “what is true” (Q 103:3: bi- l-ḥ aqqi), with steadfast-\nness (Q 90:17, 103:3: bi- l-ṣ abri), and with compassion or mercy (Q 90:17: bi- l- marḥamah).\nIn a similar fashion, Q 5:79 may be read as condemning the Israelites for not “dissuading\none another from the reprehensible t hings they did” (kānū lā yatanāhawna ʿan munkarin\nfaʿalūhu).5 Indeed, already the second verse of the same surah, Q 5:2, calls upon the be-\nlievers “to cooperate in righ teousness and fear of God,” rather than “cooperating in sin and\nenmity” (wa-t aʿāwanū ʿalā l-b irri wa-l -t aqwā wa-l ā taʿāwanū ʿalā l-i thmi wa-l -ʿ udwāni).\nIn partly identical diction, Q 58:8–9 condemns the act of “intimately conversing in sin,\nenmity, and disobedience to the Messenger” (v. 8: yatanājawna bi- l- ithmi wa- l- ʿudwāni\nwa- maʿṣiyati l- rasūli) and instead demands that believers are to “converse in righ teousness\nand fear of God” (tanājaw bi- l- birri wa- l- taqwā). Fin ally, when an oft- quoted Meccan verse,\nthe form ‘commanding X’ and ‘forbidding Y,’ where X and Y are similarly broad- spectrum ethical terms,” e.g.,\nQ 2:44 (amara bi- l- birr) or 3:21 (amara bi- l- qisṭ).\n4 On the Qur’anic understanding of the Medinan ummah, see also under → al-ʿ ālamūn.\n5 Cook questions whether tanāhā should be interpreted in a reciprocal sense here, on the ground that it is\nalso attested as a synonym of intahā, which is in fact reported as a minority variant reading of the verse (Cook\n2001, 15–16; see MQ 2:330). This is a valid objection, but in view of Q 90:17 and 103:3 I would incline in favour\nof reciprocity. As Cook observes l ater on, Islamic exegetes exhibit a certain preference for the reciprocal under-\nstanding of Q 5:79 (Cook 2001, 26–27).\nal- maʿrūf 517", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is plausible that this view resonates in the maʿrūf-\nmunkar formula as well. Perhaps by way of a counterweight, however, Q 5:105 strikes a\ndif er ent tone and seems concerned to discourage or at least limit meddlesome prying in\nother people’s moral afairs (see Cook 2001, 30–31): “O believers, look after yourselves\n(ʿalaykum anfusakum)! Someone who has gone astray cannot harm you if you are guided.\nYou will all return to God, and he will announce to you what you have done.”\n“In line with what is recognised to be right” (bi- l- maʿrūf): Qur’anic legislation and\nmoral common sense. Outside the maʿrūf-m unkar formula, the prepositional phrase bi- l-\nmaʿrūf features in quasi-l egal commandments, as noted already by Izutsu (ERCQ 214–215).\nThese instruct the Qur’anic believers, for instance, to make bequests (Q 2:180), deal with\npast, pre sent, and future spouses (e.g., Q 2:228–229.231–233, 4:19.25, 65:2), or make personal\nuse of a warden’s property (Q 4:6) “in line with what is recognised to be right.” The phrase\nbi- l- maʿrūf plays a similar role in the Constitution of Medina: the dif ere nt kinship groups that\nmake up the Medinan ummah are to h andle the payment of blood money and the ransoming\nof captives “according to what is recognised to be right and what is equitable,” bi- l- maʿrūf\nwa- l- qisṭ (Lecker 2004, §§ 3 f.), and someone who is burdened by debt is to be aided “ac-\ncording to what is recognised to be right (bi- l- maʿrūf) in m atters of ransom or blood money”\n(Lecker 2004, § 12; see also ibid., 105–100). In such prescriptive contexts, the specification\nbi- l- maʿrūf serves to signal what one might call a standard requirement of conformity with\nmoral common sense, thereby obviating the need for explicit stipulation of the dif ere nt\nforms that equity might take in a host of dif ere nt casuistic permutations. Issues to which\nthis requirement of conformity with moral common sense could be applied in the Qur’anic\nmilieu w ere clearly variegated, ranging from blood money (as in the Constitution of Medina\nand in Q 2:178) to marriage and divorce (as in some of the Qur’anic passages just cited).\nThe impor tant consequence of the Qur’anic employment of bi- l- maʿrūf is that the Is-\nlamic scripture does not presume to supply a system of behavioural rules that is both\nexhaustive and exclusively descriptive, i.e., not couched in ethically laden terminology.\nInstead, Qur’anic legislation expressly relies on its addressees’ existing understanding of\nwhat is fair and equitable (see also Christiansen 2019, 129). Thus, even after the Medinan\nQur’an’s turn towards concrete behavioural rules and a “legalistic” type of piety (Sinai\n2015–2016, 51–52 and 66–67; HCI 202–205),6 the Qur’an does not envisage the concrete\nbehavioural guidance it provides as forming an exhaustive l egal codex that could be un-\nderstood and applied without recourse to considerations of moral common sense.7 This\n6 My use of the descriptor “legalistic” is indebted to Fred Donner, as explained in Sinai 2015–2016, 67.\n7 To put it in terms of a concept recently employed by Sohaira Siddiqui, the Qur’an does not articulate a\nposition of “scriptural universalism,” meaning the view “that every action has a l egal and moral value derived\ndirectly from scripture or through reasoning on the basis of scripture” (Siddiqui 2019, 106; cf. ibid., 187, n. 3,\n518 al- maʿrūf", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The under lying singular is presum-\nably ʿālam, “world,” which is not however attested in the Qur’anic corpus. A mono thei stic\nSouth Arabian inscription speaks of “the far and near world” (b-ʿ lmn bʿdn w- qrbn; Mordt-\nmann and Müller 1896, 287 and 289–290; CIH, no. 539), reflecting the common rabbinic\ncontrast between “this world” and “the coming world” (→ ākhir).1 One might therefore be\ntempted to understand the Qur’anic term ʿālamīn to signify the pre sent world and the here-\nafter. Yet given that the so- called sound plural ending -ū n/-ī n in Arabic is normally confined\nto persons, it is problematic to understand ʿālamīn as “worlds” and as equivalent to Hebrew\nʿolamim (see, e.g., b. Bәr. 51a, speaking of “two ʿolamim, this world and the coming world”).\nThis initial reservation is in fact fully borne out by a closer examination of Qur’anic\nusage, for the corpus contains a significant number of passages in which the word al-ʿ ālamīn\nplainly refers to persons, such as denials containing the phrase “anyone of the ʿālamīn”\n(Q 5:20.115, 7:80, and 29:28) or references to divine election or favouring (ikhtāra/faḍḍala/\niṣṭafā) “over the ʿālamīn” (Q 2:47.122, 3:42, 6:86, 7:140, 44:32, and 45:16).2 The appropriate\nrendering of al-ʿ ālamīn in the Qur’an is therefore “the inhabitants of the entire world,” “the\nworld- dwellers,” or simply “all p eople” rather than “the worlds” (thus already KK 12).3 It\nis presumably in view of the evidence just surveyed that Abū ʿUbaydah glosses al-ʿ ālamīn\nas al- makhlūqāt, “created beings” (Abū ʿUbaydah 1955–1962, 1:22). He also cites a perti-\nnent parallel from the poetry of Labīd, although it is not certain that the verse’s diction\nis in de pen dent of the Qur’an: “I have not seen nor heard of anyone like them among the\nworld- dwellers (fī l-ʿ ālamīnā)” (ʿAbbās 1962, no. 49:6).\nDoes the term “world- dwellers” imply that Muhammad’s preaching has a universal\nremit? From early on, the Qur’anic proclamations style themselves as a “reminder for the\nworld- dwellers” (dhikrun li- l-ʿ ālamīn; see Q 68:52 and 81:27 in the early Meccan period\nand Q 6:90, 12:104, and 38:87 in l ater Meccan surahs), and Muhammad is said to have been\nsent “as a mercy for the world- dwellers” (raḥmatan li- l-ʿ ālamīn; Q 21:107) and as a “warner”\n1 See also Robin 2000, citing another Sabaic occurrence of ʿlm in Ry 508, l. 11 (which has w- trḥm ʿly kl ʿlm,\n“and bestow mercy upon all the world”).\n2 See also Q 26:165 (referring to “the males among the ʿālamīn”) and 29:10 (speaking of the “breasts of the\nʿālamīn”) as well as 15:70. On ikhtāra and iṣṭafā, see Firestone 2011, 399–400 and 401–402.\n3 Neuwirth nonetheless opines that rabb al-ʿ ālamīn should be credited with an eschatological dimension, in\nview of its relationship to ribbono shel ʿolam / ribbon ha- ʿolamim and in view of the fact that the meaning “Lord of\nthe world’s inhabitants” could have been expressed by rabb al- nās, found in Q 114:1 (Neuwirth 2017, 90). However,\nit is methodologically problematic to privilege the semantic connotations of a pre- Qur’anic antecedent over the\nsemantic implications of Qur’anic usage. Moreover, verse-fi nal rabb al-ʿ ālamīn could hardly be replaced by rabb\nal- nās without seriously compromising rhyme, meaning that the Qur’anic preference for the former expression\nover the latter does not carry much weight. In addition, the one Qur’anic instance of rabb al- nās does not suffice\nto establish the term as an entrenched part of the Qur’an’s formulaic lexicon; most likely, it is simply a one- of\nvariant for the usual rabb al-ʿ ālamīn. Rabb al- nās is also employed in a verse by al- Aʿshā Maymūn (Ḥusayn 1983,\nno. 55:34), though this observation has no obvious bearing on the argument at hand.\nal- ʿālamūn 521", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

At least prima facie, such statements create a strong impression\nthat Muhammad’s preaching had a universal outlook from the start. A fter all, when the\nQur’an calls God rabb al-ʿ ālamīn (see u nder → rabb) or when the divine voice reminds the\nIsraelites that “I have preferred you over the ʿālamīn” (Q 2:47.122), ʿālamīn can hardly mean\nanything other than all of the world- dwellers. Such a universalist reading could be further\nbuttressed by adducing verses according to which Muhammad’s preaching or revelations\nare directed at “the people” or “h umans” (li- l- nās), such as Q 7:158 (instructing Muhammad\nto say, “O p eople, I am God’s messenger to you all,” qul yā- ayyuhā l- nāsu innī rasūlu llāhi\nilaykum jamīʿan), 34:28 (“We only sent youS as a bringer of good tidings and a warner for\nall the p eople, yet most p eople have no knowledge,” wa- mā arsalnāka illā kāffatan li- l- nāsi\nbashīran wa- nadhīran wa- lākinna akthara l- nāsi lā yaʿlamūn), and 39:41 (“We have truly\nsent down upon youS the scripture for the people,” li- l- nāsi).4\nHowever, as noted by Ahrens (Ahrens 1935, 129), other Meccan verses attribute a much\nmore localised remit to Muhammad’s ministry and pre sent him as a messenger who has\nbeen sent to warn “the mother-t own” (umm al- qurā)—i .e., Mecca— “and those dwelling\naround it” (Q 6:92, 42:7),5 or even as somebody who is to warn merely his “close kin”\n(Q 26:214). Indeed, assuming the general rule that God “has never sent any messenger\nexcept in the language of his p eople” (wa- mā arsalnā min rasūlin illā bi- lisāni qawmihi;\nQ 14:4),6 it appears axiomatically impossible that the “Arabic (→ ʿarabī) recitation” granted\nto Muhammad (Q 12:2, 20:113, 39:28, 41:3, 42:7 etc.) could be intended to address a non-\nArabophone audience (Buhl 1926, 145). The tension between universal and parochial\nstatements is heightened by the fact that they can occur in close proximity, namely, in\nQ 6:90 (“This is only a reminder for the world- dwellers,” in huwa illā dhikrā li- l-ʿ ālamīn)\nand 6:92, one of the two verses cited e arlier that define Muhammad’s role as preaching\nto “the mother- town and those dwelling around it” (li-t undhira umma l-q urā wa-m an\nḥawlahā; see Buhl 1926, 144).\nOne could, of course, decide to let the tension stand and posit that at least in the Meccan\nsurahs a universalist and a parochial strand of thought compete with one another. But is it\nreally impossible to reconcile the apparent contradiction? One way of doing so would be\nto construe seemingly parochial statement in light of more universal ones. For instance,\nwhen Muhammad is told to admonish his kinsfolk or the “mother- town,” this may only\nidentify the immediate starting point of his preaching rather than to set limits on his ul-\ntimate missionary outreach (thus Goldziher 1910, 25). It is admittedly difficult to discern\nwith any precision how extensive the “p eople” (qawm) to whom Muhammad is supposed\nto have been sent are understood to be. But if we consider their defining characteristic to\nbe use of the Arabic language, then the Qur’anic target audience must extend well beyond\nMecca and the region surrounding it. Still, even if we expand Muhammad’s intended remit\nto a pan-A rabophone public, some tension between universalism and parochialism w ill\n4 Among the c. fifty Qur’anic occurrences of li- l- nās, see in addition especially t hose in Q 2:185, 3:4, 4:79,\n6:91, 14:52, 16:44, 17:89, 18:54, 30:58, and 39:27. As shown by places like Q 2:60 (kullu unās) or 7:82, the indefinite\nform corresponding to al- nās is unās (cf. insān; CDKA 30).\n5 Q 43:31 refers to “the two settlements,” perhaps Mecca and al- Ṭāʾif. Q 7:96–98 thrice mention the “in-\nhabitants of the settlements” (ahl al- qurā), though at least v. 96 suggests that reference is to a sinful collective\npunished in the past rather than to the Qur’an’s con temporary addressees (but see Marshall 1999, 55, n. 20).\n6 The same point is made, albeit less unequivocally, in Q 19:97 and 44:58, according to which God has “ren-\ndered easy” the Qur’anic recitations in the Messenger’s own language (yassarnāhu bi-l isānika).

Of course, those who are not speakers\nof Arabic, or not native or fluent speakers thereof, w ill still count as belonging to the sum\ntotal of “world- dwellers.” Hence, even if Muhammad is considered God’s messenger to\nall speakers of Arabic, how is this to be squared with statements in which he is apparently\nsaid to be a warner to all world- dwellers (e.g., Q 25:1)?\nRather than reading ostensibly parochial statements in light of universal ones, one\nmight also adopt the opposite, or perhaps complementary, strategy of qualifying osten-\nsibly universal statements in light of more parochial ones. In concrete terms, this would\nmean resisting the view that the phrases li-l - ʿālamīn and li-l -n ās attribute an expressly\nuniversal reach to Muhammad’s preaching (against, e.g., Goldziher 1910, 25–26) and re-\nstricting their contextual reference in line with other verses (thus Buhl 1926, 143–145).\nIt is true that some occurrences of al- nās clearly have a universal scope, such as Q 2:213,\naccording to which “ people” (al-n ās) once formed a single primordial community (see\nunder → ummah). Nonetheless, in other contexts the phrase li-l -n ās could feasibly be\nunderstood to mean “not ‘to mankind’ but ‘to men,’ in the sense of ‘to every body’ ” (Snouck\nHurgronje 1916, 49), or rather to every body within a given context.7 That this is at least\na pos si ble signification of li- l- nās emerges very clearly from Q 10:2 and 26:39, where the\nexpression designates a general public within a highly specific setting— namely, the local\nmilieu of Muhammad himself and the Egyptian populace witnessing Moses’s encounter\nwith Phar aoh. Th ere is nothing in princip le to rule out extending such a construal of li- l- nās\neven to the more emphatic kāffatan li- l- nās in Q 34:28 (mā arsalnāka illā kāffatan li- l- nāsi\nbashīran wa- nadhīran), “We only sent youS as a bringer of good tidings and a warner for\nevery one”— that is, for the general public of Muhammad’s appointed constituency, which\nmight either consist in the inhabitants of Mecca and “ those dwelling around it” (Q 6:92)\nor in the totality of all speakers of Arabic.\nSimilarly, the phrase li-l - ʿālamīn, too, does not necessitate that the Qur’anic procla-\nmations envision Muhammad’s audience to be humanity at large (thus already Snouck\nHurgronje 1916, 49). After all, as Buhl remarks, Jesus is expressly said to have been a\n“messenger to the Israelites” (Q 3:49; see also 61:6) while nonetheless being described,\nin a chronologically e arlier verse, as forming a “sign li- l-ʿ ālamīn” together with his m other\n(Q 21:91). A persuasive way of interpreting Q 21:91, therefore, is to parse li-l - ʿālamīn as\nsynonymous with li- l- nās, i.e., as meaning simply “for people.”8 Equating the force of li- l-\nʿālamīn with li- l- nās is rendered especially attractive in view of Q 19:21, forming a parallel\nto 21:91 that describes Jesus as a sign li- l- nās rather than li- l-ʿ ālamīn, but with no discernible\ndiference in meaning. It seems pertinent that ʿālamīn occurs virtually always in verse- final\nposition,9 which suggests that employment of li- l-ʿ ālamīn rather than li- l- nās could simply\nbe due to considerations of rhyme rather than to any semantic diference between the two\n7 See also Wild 2006, 145, and Stewart 2022, 224 (quoting the latter): “it is likely that in most if not all\ncases, nās refers to the generality of people in the immediate audience in their capacity as humans, and not to\nall humanity.”\n8 One might, of course, also contemplate an evolutionary account of the relationship between Q 21:91, on the\none hand, and 3:49 and 61:6, on the other: perhaps it is only in the Medinan surahs that Jesus is understood to be\na messenger to the Israelites? However, this would not solve the prob lem that Muhammad, too, is said to convey\na reminder li- l-ʿ ālamīn while si mul ta neously being depicted as addressing a localised context. Since the relevant\nverses about Muhammad, inspected above, are all equally Meccan, it does not seem likely that the apparent\ncontradiction between Q 21:91, on the one hand, and 3:49 and 61:6, on the other, is to be solved diachronically.\n9 The only one of the word’s seventy- three occurrences in the Qur’an that is not verse- final is in Q 25:1.\nal- ʿālamūn 523", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, in so far as Muhammad preaches one universal and\nunchanging divine message— namely, to worship and show fitting gratitude to the divine\ncreator and to expect an eschatological reckoning—t he Qur’anic proclamations express a\n“reminder for the world- dwellers” in general (e.g., Q 81:27), despite the fact that by virtue\nof being in Arabic they are directed at a par tic u lar linguistic group among others.\nMedinan developments: the Qur’anic ummah as “witnesses set up over the p eople.”\nThe preceding discussion having largely been confined to Meccan data, it is appropriate\nto devote a separate section to the question of the Qur’an’s assumed remit in the Medinan\nsurahs. These lack statements implying that Muhammad’s intended audience is confined\nto his hometown and its surrounding region. They also give significant hints that Mu-\nhammad’s missionary role is ultimately intended to extend well beyond a constituency of\nArabic- speaking pagans. For instance, while the original nucleus of the Qur’anic commu-\nnity of believers, the ummah, is understood to be drawn from the Meccan descendants of\nAbraham and Ishmael (Q 2:128, 14:37), the Medinan ummah appears to have been open to\nnew joiners from outside Ishmael’s Meccan progeny (for more detail, see u nder → ummah).\nIn addition, Q 2:143 says that God brought the Qur’anic ummah into existence “so that\nyoup might be witnesses set up over the people (li- takūnū shuhadāʾa ʿalā l- nāsi; cf. 22:78)\nand the Messenger might be a witness (shahīd) set up over you”; and Q 3:110 defines the\nMedinan ummah as “the best community ever brought forth for people” (kuntum khayra\nummatin ukhrijat li- l- nāsi). Of course, given what was just said about the meaning of al- nās,\none cannot without further ado assume that the “ people” in question here must amount\nto all of humanity rather than, say, to all speakers of Arabic. Yet given that the Medinan\nsurahs do not contain reminders of the Arabic nature of the Qur’anic proclamations nor\nreiterate the princip le that e very messenger is sent “in the language of his p eople” (Q 14:4),\na universal reading of Q 2:143 and 3:110 is, minimally, more persuasive than for similar\nMeccan passages.\nThe impression that Muhammad’s remit undergoes considerable expansion in the\nMedinan surahs is further reinforced by the fact that Medinan passages give him the\ntask of serving as God’s messenger to the ummiyyūn, i.e., to the “scriptureless” in general\n(Q 7:157–158, 62:2–3; see u nder → ummī): Muhammad, it appears, is charged with reaching\nout to all t hose parts of humankind who have hitherto remained outside God’s revelatory\nengagement with the ancient Israelites and their Jewish and Christian successors.

Simi-\nlarly, in Q 5:15.19 the divine voice characterises “our Messenger” as having been sent to\nthe “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb) in order to provide them with clarity (yā- ahla\nl- kitābi qad jāʾakum rasūlunā yubayyinu lakum) about “much of what youp have been hiding\nof the scripture” (v. 15: kathīran mimmā kuntum tukhfūna mina l-k itābi). Parenthetically,\nthe claim that Qur’anic revelations are meant to “make things clear” (→ bayyana) to the\nrecipients of previous revelations is also intimated in Q 16:44, which occurs in a Meccan\nsurah; but this verse is quite likely to be a Medinan insertion.12\nIt follows, then, that the Medinan surahs in par tic u lar pre sent Muhammad’s prophetic\nmission as aimed at the scriptureless and the scripture- bearers alike, and in this sense cast\nit as universal. Such a universal understanding of Muhammad’s remit, moreover, accords\nwith the tripartite historical scheme under lying Surah 2, leading from the primordial lapse\nof Adam to the contrasting establishment of a positive standard of right eousness and piety\nby Abraham to the communal embodiment of this Abrahamic exemplar in the form of\nthe Medinan ummah (HCI 103–104). The Medinan ummah is thus correlated with the\nindividual ancestor of all of humanity, Adam, and in this sense takes on a world-h istorical\nrole— especially if one accepts that Q 33:40, calling Muhammad the “seal of the prophets”\n(khātam al- nabiyyīn), casts him as God’s final messenger (see under → khatama).\nYet even if Muhammad assumes a world-h istorical role in the Medinan Qur’an, this does\nnot entail that the implicit objective of the Medinan surahs was a scenario in which the\n11 Thus, according to Mohsen Goudarzi, Muhammad’s ministry had the “goal of broadening the remit of\ndivine election to include all of Abraham’s children— descendants of Ishmael as well as those of Isaac and Jacob”\n(Goudarzi 2019, 483). If that is correct, then even in the Medinan surahs non- Abrahamite humanity would simply\nremain outside the Qur’an’s focus.\n12 Following on from a statement about previous messengers (Q 16:43) that is virtually identical with Q 21:7,\n16:44 apprises the Qur’anic Messenger that he has received “reminding exhortation” so that he might “make\nclear to the p eople what was sent down to them” (wa- anzalnā ilayka l- dhikra li- tubayyina li- l- nāsi mā nuzzila\nilayhim). Though Surah 16 as a whole is Meccan, it is clear that it contains other Medinan insertions as well, such\nas the allusions to emigration in Q 16:41–42.110 (GQ 145–146; Neuwirth 2007, 300–301) and the dietary rules in\n16:114–118 (Sinai 2019c, 130–131). As regards Q 16:44, the verse sits oddly in its immediate context. The immedi-\nately preceding verse, Q 16:43, instructs the addressees to seek authoritative confirmation from “the recipients\nof reminding exhortation” (ahl al- dhikr), who must be the Jews and/or Christians. Yet Q 16:44 then goes on to\npre sent the recipients of prior revelations as themselves standing in need of clarifying instruction, which would\nseem to undercut the function they are supposed to play according to v. 43. Also noteworthy is the phrase li-\ntubayyina li- l- nāsi from Q 16:44, since all other occurrences of the verb bayyana together with the prepositional\nobject li- l- nās are found in Medinan surahs (Q 2:159.187.221, 3:187; cf. 22:5; 3:138 has bayānun li- l-n āsi). If Q 16:44\nis indeed a Medinan insertion, its presumptive function would be to counteract the apparent recourse to Jews\nand Christians as a source of authoritative knowledge in the preceding verse: the Qur’anic Messenger, rather\nthan deriving his authority from Jewish and/or Christian recognition, as Q 16:43 might seem to imply, is in fact\nendowed with the authority to instruct Jews and Christians too.\nal- ʿālamūn 525", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Jesus’s command to “make disciples of all nations” or ethnē in Matt 28:19). Th ere is no\nunequivocal textual warrant for attributing to the Medinan Qur’an the vision of establishing\na proselytising world religion of the kind eventually exemplified by post- Qur’anic Islam.\nInstead, it is preferable to understand the assumed universal role of Muhammad and his\nfollowers in line with Q 2:143, 22:78, and 3:110: the Qur’anic believers are to function as\nan exemplary beacon for the rest of humanity, as “the best community ever brought forth\nfor p eople, enjoining right and dissuading from wrong” (Q 3:110: kuntum khayra ummatin\nukhrijat li- l- nāsi taʾmurūna bi- l- maʿrūfi wa- tanhawna ʿani l- munkari), and as a “ middle” or\n“intermediate” community (ummah wasaṭ) who w ill be “witnesses” over the remainder\nof humankind, just as the Qur’anic Messenger functions as a “witness” (shahīd) over the\nQur’anic believers (Q 2:143, similarly 22:78). As other passages make clear, the Prophet’s role\nin relation to his believing followers is that of a “good exemplar” (Q 33:21: uswah ḥasanah)\nwho will model to them a right eous and pious life, just as “Abraham and those with him,”\ntoo, provide the believers with a “good exemplar” (Q 60:4.6; cf. also 2:124 and 16:120,\nemploying the apparent synonyms → ummah and imām).13 H umans wanting to live a life\napt to pass eschatological scrutiny, the Qur’an assumes, require concrete role models to\nemulate, and just as Abraham and also Muhammad functioned or function as an individual\nrole model (ummah, imam, uswah) for “the people,” li- l- nāsi (Q 2:124), so the believers are to\nserve as a collective model—as a communal exemplar or ummah— for “the people,” li- l- nāsi\n(Q 3:110), that is, for all t hose who are not, or not yet, part of the ummah (cf. Denny 1975, 55).\nBearing all of this in mind, it is in ter est ing to take another look at the meaning of\nshahīd in Q 2:143 and 22:78. Both verses call the Qur’anic believers “witnesses over the\npeople” (shuhadāʾ ʿalā l- nāsi). The sense that these two passages would seem to attach to\nthe word is not that of someone who will function as a witness of divine prosecution at\nthe eschatological judgement, as in other passages (see under → ummah and → rasūl),\nbut rather that of someone who bears authoritative testimony regarding God and the life\nthat he would have humans lead. Corroborating this interpretation, the description of the\nQur’anic community as “witnesses” in these two verses may well be a deliberate echo of Isa\n43:10, where the p eople of Israel are called YHWH’s “witnesses” (ʿēday, Peshitta: sāhday;\nsee also Isa 44:8).14 The global or universal role of the Qur’anic ummah in human history\nis thus conceived in terms very similar to the function of a “light to the nations” that is\nascribed to the people of Israel elsewhere in the book of Isaiah (Isa 42:6, 49:6). Indeed,\nthe Qur’an hints that the Israelites w ere given a similar task, in so far as Q 3:187 relates\nthat “ those who w ere given the scripture” w ere charged with “making the scripture clear\nto the p eople and not concealing it” (la- tubayyinunnahu li- l- nāsi wa- lā taktumūnahu).15\nHere, the prepositional syntagm li- l- nās, “to the p eople,” is the same one also encountered\nin Q 3:110, cited above, even though 3:187 makes it very clear that the previous recipients\nof God’s scripture failed to carry out what was expected of them.\n13 See also Q 43:59, which may be casting Jesus, too, as a model and exemplar, though the term used here\nis → mathal.\n14 I owe my awareness of the Biblical parallel to Levenson 1996, 155. By way of a supplementary remark on\nQ 2:143 and 22:78, see Sinai 2018a, 25, surmising that the application of the word shahīd to Muhammad may h ere\nhave connotations of episcopal oversight.\n15 On katama, see under → ˻ahl al- kitāb.\n526 al- ʿālamūn", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This means\nprob ably not, or not merely, that their beliefs and practices chart out an ideally moderate\ncourse (e.g., Ṭab. 2:626–627),16 but also that they are to function as a global focal point\nexemplifying the qualities of piety and righ teousness that God intends other humans to\nemulate. Taking inspiration from the Pakistani scholar Jāvēd Aḥmad Ghāmidī, we might\nsay that the Qur’anic community is one that is supposed to mediate between God and\nthe rest of humanity by bearing witness to him.17 Another expression for this exemplary\nstanding of the Qur’anic ummah, it seems, is the recurrent phrase “enjoining right and\ndissuading from wrong” (see u nder → maʿrūf): similar to Q 3:110, quoted above, a slightly\nearlier verse in the same surah, 3:104, addresses the believers by saying that “from youp\nshall come to be a community summoning to good, enjoining right, and dissuading from\nwrong” (wa- l- takun minkum ummatun yadʿūna ilā l-k hayri wa-y aʾmurūna bi-l -m aʿrūfi\nwa- yanhawna ʿani l- munkari).\nAll of this bears out the claim that the implied aim of Muhammad’s ministry is not a\nglobal proselytising efort by means of which all humans will ultimately be inducted into\nthe Medinan ummah. Indeed, other Medinan passages make it perfectly clear that a plu-\nrality of human communities, set apart by dif er ent practices and customs (although not\nby substantially dif er ent religious beliefs), is an inevitable feature of the pre sent cosmic\norder (Q 5:48) and that the members of other religious communities than the Qur’anic\nummah are by no means precluded from achieving eschatological salvation (Q 2:62,\n5:69; see in more detail under → aslama). Drawing on a book chapter by Jon Levenson\nwhose conceptual importance to students of the Qur’an has recently been underscored\nby Goudarzi (Goudarzi 2019, 481–482), one may summarise the preceding by saying that\nthe Qur’anic ummah’s divinely intended role in history lay not in absorbing the other\nhuman communities existing alongside it but rather in opening up a “universal horizon”\n(Levenson 1996) serving to orient the rest of humankind during the period of time— quite\npossibly believed to be limited— that was left until the resurrection (see under → sāʿah).\nTo be sure, the Qur’an’s tolerance for pluralism and diversity has unequivocal limits:\nany “association” or “partnering” (shirk; see under → ashraka) of other beings with God\nis to be eradicated, if needs be by force of arms (see under → jāhada), and all religious\nworship (→ dīn2) must be directed at God alone (Q 2:193 and 8:39: wa- qātilūhum ḥattā\nlā takūna fitnatun wa- yakūna l- dīnu ±​<kulluhu> li- llāhi; see also 9:33, 48:28, 61:9: huwa\nlladhī arsala rasūlahu bi-l -h udā wa-d īni l- ḥaqqi li-y uẓhirahu ʿalā l-d īni kullihi). But while\nthis means that the Qur’anic ummah is tasked with modelling and enforcing true belief\nin and worship of God, it does not set out the homogenising vision of uniting all humans\nin one global community.\n16 In favour of this understanding of the phrase “ middle community,” one could cite Q 5:66 (KK 35), refer-\nring to a “moderate community” (ummah muqtaṣidah) among the scripture- owners. But as Q 35:32 shows (see\nunder → ˻ahl al- kitāb), the attribute muqtaṣid is relatively faint praise and prob ably means “middling” rather\nthan “ideally balanced.” That, of course, is still something; but it does undermine the ability of Q 5:66 to function\nas a parallel to Q 2:143, which must have a more unequivocally positive purport.\n17 See https:// www. javedahmedghamidi. org/ #!/ quran? chapter=​ ​2&paragraph=​ ​65&type=​ ​Ghamidi, no. 350\n(accessed 23 November 2021), pointed out to me by Saqib Hussain.

It deserves to be\nadded that this idea at least partly suffices to circumvent the question how a linguistically\nspecific set of revelations— namely, the “Arabic Qur’an” brought by Muhammad (e.g., Q 12:2,\n43:3)— might have a universal significance for humankind at large. After all, even after the\nhijrah, Meccan statements like Q 12:2 or 14:4 ( every messenger is sent “in the language of\nhis p eople”) would have continued to be known to Muhammad’s followers. Still, Medinan\nintimations that Muhammad and the Qur’anic ummah have an ecumenical role to play do\nnot engender a proper contradiction with these earlier Meccan topoi: though the Qur’anic\nproclamations may be customised to speak to an Arabophone audience, t hose unable to\nreceive God’s guidance in its Qur’anic form w ill still be able to observe the “community\nsummoning to good, enjoining right, and dissuading from wrong” (Q 3:104) that has come\nto be from Muhammad’s revelations, and w ill accordingly have access to a communal, rather\nthan textual, embodiment of God’s w ill. Muhammad and the Qur’anic revelations mediate\nGod’s guidance to his immediate followers, while the community of the believers that has\nformed around him mediates God’s guidance to the rest of the ecumene.\nWhat the foregoing makes clear, in any case, is that the Medinan Qur’an can justifiably\nbe said to articulate a more universalist understanding of Muhammad’s mission than the\nMeccan surahs, in which the horizon of Muhammad’s preaching does not transcend an Arab\nor Arabophone audience. It may well be that from the Medinan Qur’an’s more universalist\nvantage point, earlier Meccan statements defining the remit of the Qur’anic revelations as\nbeing li- l-ʿ ālamīn and li- l- nās would have been construed by Muhammad’s followers in a\nmore verbatim sense than their presumptive original force. As we saw, the “ people” (nās)\nfor whom the Qur’anic ummah is to function as an exemplary beacon according to Q 2:143\nand 3:110 is likely to be humankind at large. Against this background, when a Medinan\naddition to a Meccan surah instructs Muhammad to say, “O p eople (yā- ayyuhā l- nāsu)!\nI am God’s Messenger to you all (Q 7:158: innī rasūlu llāhi ilaykum jamīʿan),”19 one might\nunderstand this quite literally. It would seem, therefore, that the Qur’anic believers’ relo-\ncation to Medina, where they were joined by non- Qurashī “helpers” (anṣār; Q 9:100.117)\nand came to rub shoulders with a local Jewish community (→ al- yahūd), coincided with\na palpable widening of the Meccan surahs’ preoccupation with “the mother- town and\nthose dwelling around it” (Q 6:92, 42:7). This broadening of Muhammad’s mission did\nnot however lead to a negation of the singular importance of the Meccan sanctuary (see\nunder → bayt). Instead, like the Qur’anic ummah, that sanctuary was now given, in Q 3:96,\na universal role in God’s dealings with humanity at large, in so far as it came to be described\nas “the first h ouse [of worship] established for the p eople” (again, li- l- nāsi) and as “guidance\nfor the world- dwellers” (see HCI 205–206).\n18 One might consider this a Qur’anic analogue of Christian ecclesiology, though the Qur’anic ummah is of\ncourse a po liti cal community as well.\n19 On the Medinan date of Q 7:157–158, see under → ummī.\n528 al- ʿālamūn", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Safaitic ʿmr + acc. can similarly be taken to mean “to inhabit, to stay at” (see C 2953 and\nMKWS 8 in Al- Jallad 2015a, 238 and 273). The aptness of the general semantic range thus cir-\ncumscribed is confirmed by Q 30:9, where ʿamara must have the sense of cultivating, namely,\nthe earth (CDKA 194). It is worth noting that in the second one of the Safaitic attestations just\ncited, the stay in question is a short one of a mere six days. This invites the hypothesis that\nArabic ʿamara, too, can signify a brief visit and not only long-t erm residence. This, in turn,\nexplains why the term ʿumrah—w hich in Q 2:196 figures next to the → ḥajj— designates the\nso- called minor pilgrimage, or rather “visit,” to the Meccan sanctuary.\nSome uncertainty arises with regard to two further occurrences of ʿamara and its verbal\nnoun ʿimārah in Q 9:17–19. Assuming the translation “to maintain, to administer,” for which\nI s hall argue in what follows, the passage declares that the associators are not entitled to\n“administer God’s places of prostration” (an yaʿmurū masājid allāh), given that they “bear\nwitness against themselves that they are repudiators” (shāhidīna ʿalā anfusihim bi-l -k ufri;\nv. 17). Rather, only someone who believes in God and in the final day, performs prayer, gives\nalms, and fears only God is allowed to “administer God’s places of prostration” (v. 18). Q 9:19,\nin commenting further on this, employs the verbal noun ʿimārah, and links “administering\n(ʿimārah) the sacred place of prostration” with “giving water to the pilgrims” (siqāyat\nal- ḥājj). This pairing in par tic ul ar makes it compelling to understand ʿamara and its verbal\nnoun ʿimārah to mean “to maintain, to take care of, to administer” in Q 9:17–19. The point\nof the passage, therefore, is to strip the associators of the right to oversee and manage the\nMeccan sanctuary (see KK 197), i.e., to divest them of control over it.\nʿamara 529", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This\nlikely parallels a phrase in Q 2:196, enjoining the addressees to “perform the ḥajj and the\nʿumrah,” such that man ḥajja l- bayta awi ʿtamara in 2:158 ought to be rendered “ those who\nperform the ḥajj to the house or undertake a cultic visitation (ʿumrah) [of it].” Iʿtamara\ncould be construed as implicitly transitive here, just as ʿamara is transitive in Q 9:17–18,\nalthough one might in this case have expected awi ʿtamarahu rather than awi ʿtamara1\nAlternatively, iʿtamara could be intransitive, “to perform the ʿumrah.”\nistaʿmara tr. fī l- arḍ | to settle s.o. on the earth\n→ makkana\nʿamila l- ṣāliḥāti/ṣāliḥan | to do righ teous deeds\n→ ṣāliḥ\nʿamiya intr. | to be or become blind\nʿamā | blindness\naʿmā | blind\nʿamūn pl. | blind\n1 Still, a transitive use of iʿtamara is confirmed by the lexica, according to which iʿtamara means “to visit”\n(AEL 2154).\n530 istaʿmara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Similar to the human\nheart (→ qalb), the Qur’an often describes the senses of hearing and sight as impervious\nto divine exhortation. For instance, Q 6:25, 17:46, 31:7, and 41:5.44 speak of ears sufering\nfrom heaviness or dullness (waqr), sometimes in conjunction with hearts that are “u nder\ncovers” (fī akinnah). In many other verses, too, blindness (ʿ- m- y), deafness (ṣ- m- m), and\nalso muteness (b- k- m) serve as meta phors for inveterate unbelief, while being “sighted”\n(baṣīr) or “seeing” (abṣara) represent the ability to grasp God’s guidance (e.g., Q 2:18.171,\n5:71, 6:39.50.104, 7:64, 8:22, 11:24, 13:16.19, 16:76, 25:73, 27:66).1 Several verses tell the\nMessenger that he is unable to “guide the blind” (see Q 10:43, 27:81, 30:53, 43:40), some-\ntimes with the addition “out of their astrayness” (ʿan ḍalālatihim; → ḍalla), or to “cause\nthe deaf to hear” (Q 10:42, 27:80, 30:52, 43:40; cf. 21:45), meaning that his preaching w ill\nnot sway hardened repudiators. Q 41:17 explic itly opposes “blindness” (ʿamā), clearly\nemployed in the figurative sense of religious blindness, to “guidance” (hudā; → hadā).\nMoreover, those who turn away from God’s address, and thereby prove themselves to be\nblind in this world, are threatened with literal blindness, muteness, and deafness on the\nday of resurrection (Q 17:72.97, 20:124–126).\nIn some statements, God is explic itly identified as the one responsible for blocking\nor “sealing” (→ khatama or ṭabaʿa ʿalā) the hearing and sight of humans, in the sense of\nmaking them unresponsive to divine signs and revelations. As explained elsewhere, this\ndoes not necessarily have predestinarian implications (see under → khatama and → qalb).\nLiteral disability in the Qur’an. The meta phorical invocations of disability just pre-\nsented must be kept distinct from the Qur’an’s treatment of literal disability. The distinc-\ntion between meta phorical blindness and literal blindness is expressed rather clearly in\nQ 22:46: a fter posing the rhetorical question w hether the Qur’anic opponents lack “hearts\nwith which to understand” and “ears with which to hear,” the final segment of the verse\nunderlines that “it is not the eyes that are blind but the hearts in the breasts” (fa- innahā lā\ntaʿmā l- abṣāru wa- lākin taʿmā l- qulūbu llatī fī l-ṣ udūr; see also under → qalb). As regards\nbodily illness and disability, a number of Medinan passages (Q 2:184.185.196, 4:43.102, 5:6,\n9:91, 24:61, 48:17, 73:20) contain special provisions and alleviations of certain command-\nments for t hose who are literally ill (marīḍ; see also u nder → maraḍ), blind, or lame (aʿraj).\nMoreover, the association between blindness and other disabilities, on the one hand, and\ninsufficient moral or religious per for mance, on the other, that arises from the material\ndiscussed in the previous section is to some degree counterbalanced by the early Meccan\npassage Q 80:1–10. It reprimands the Qur’anic Messenger for turning away from a blind\nman who, the Qur’an say, may go on to “purify himself” (tazakkā; see u nder → zakāh) and\n“heed God’s hortatory reminders” (tadhakkara; → dhakkara).

Notions of divine wrath, contrasting with and complementing divine mercy,\nplay an impor tant role in ancient Near Eastern, Biblical, and late antique conceptions of\nthe divine (e.g., Kratz and Spieckermann 2008; see also Reynolds 2020, 165–166). The\nQur’an stands squarely in this broad tradition of anthropopathic theological discourse,\njust as the Qur’anic deity is implied to be corporeal and humanoid (→ allāh). Thus, the\nQur’an includes, for instance, retellings of a prominent Biblical episode of divine anger,\nthe Israelites’ worship of the Golden Calf, in the wake of which Moses had to dissuade God\nfrom letting his wrath “burn hot against” the Israelites and from “consuming” them (Exod\n32:10–14). What follows is a succinct overview of Qur’anic references to God’s wrath,\nsubdivided into Meccan and Medinan surahs and concluded by some general remarks on\nthe way in which the vari ous anthropopathic traits that the Qur’an ascribes to God— such\nas mercy and love, on the one hand, and wrath and retaliatory scheming, on the other—\nrelate and respond to antecedent human righ teousness or sin.\nDivine wrath in the Meccan surahs. In the Meccan Qur’an, the dialectic of God’s mercy\n(see under → al- raḥmān) and wrath is prominently signalled in Sūrat al- Fātiḥah, which\nboth calls God the “truly Merciful” (Q 1:3: al- raḥmān al- raḥīm) and concludes by evoking\nthose who are subject to his wrath (Q 1:7: al- maghḍūb ʿalayhim).

Of t hese verses,\nQ 7:152 and 20:81.86 occur in the context of the Israelites’ wanderings after the Exodus and\nespecially their veneration of the Golden Calf, continuing the Biblical link between this\nepisode and God’s wrath. In addition, Q 7:150.154 refer to the wrath of Moses against the\nworshippers of the Golden Calf, which clearly mirrors God’s wrath from v. 152.1 Especially\nin Surah 7’s recounting of the Israelites’ veneration of the Golden Calf and of a following\nencounter between God and seventy Israelites, one observes that the allusions to anger in\nvv. 150, 152, and 154 are surrounded, interspersed, and counterbalanced by multiple pleas\nfor and evocations of divine mercy (r-ḥ - m; see vv. 149, 151, 153, 154, 155, and 156). Like the\nFātiḥah, this foregrounds God’s dual capacity to be both merciful and angry. It has been\nargued that references to God’s wrath in the context of the Golden Calf narratives from\nSurahs 7 and 20 are later insertions that reflect only a subsequent Medinan “discovery of\ndivine wrath” (Neuwirth 2010, 518), but as shown in the excursus below this hypothesis\nis open to grave objections. Despite the prominence of divine wrath in the Qur’anic ac-\ncounts of the incident of the Golden Calf, moreover, one must note that the Israelites are\nby no means the only targets of God’s anger in Meccan surahs: in Q 7:71 it is the people of\nʿĀd who are threatened with God’s wrath, while Q 16:106 announces God’s wrath against\nthose who revert to repudiation after having believed in God (see also Q 42:16). Divine\nire is thus a stance whose potential objects can be any h uman miscreant rather than one\nexclusively associated with the Israelites (against Neuwirth 2017, 345; see also Reynolds\n2020, 167–168).\nAlthough Neuwirth’s Medinan dating of the Qur’an’s “discovery of divine wrath” is\nnot tenable, the hypothesis that at some point in the Qur’an’s genesis there was such a\n“discovery” is apt, since there are no early Meccan occurrences of the root gh- ḍ- b, with\nthe sole exception of the final verse of the Fātiḥah (Q 1:7). Assuming that the Fātiḥah\ndates to the early Meccan period, based on what is prob ably a retrospective reference\nto it in Q 15:87 (see under → mathānī), Q 1:7 emerges as the chronologically first explicit\nQur’anic reference to divine wrath. Conceivably, this earliest invocation of God’s anger\nserves to counterbalance what is also one of the earliest Qur’anic occurrences of the divine\nname → al- raḥmān, “the Merciful,” in Q 1:3.\nIt is true, of course, that early Meccan surahs make statements about God or rather\nabout his actions that to some degree imply his propensity to just ire. Thus, apart from\nstirring threats of eschatological torment (e.g., Q 74:8–30) and allusions to vario us divine\nchastisements in previous history (e.g., Q 73:15–16), Q 15:79 describes God as exacting\nretribution (fa-n taqamnā minhum). Another early Meccan statement that likely had at\nleast a connotation of divine wrath is Q 74:5. It urges the Messenger to “shun” → al- rujz/\nal- rijz, approximately translatable as “punishment.” As noted in the respective entry, rujz/\nrijz is cognate with, and likely derived from, Syriac rūgzā, “wrath,” and indeed in Q 7:71\nits variant rijs is paired with ghaḍab.2 Still, the Qur’anic use of rujz/rijz would seem to\nforeground the external expressions of divine wrath (i.e., the punishment ensuing from\nit) rather than the m ental or emotional state giving rise to it. In fact, none of the early\n1 Cf. the similar symmetry between Exod 32:11–13 (Moses assuages the wrath of God) and Exod 32:22 (Aaron\nassuages the wrath of Moses).\n2 Apart from Q 74:5, rijz/rujz also figures in the later Meccan verses 7:134.135.162, 10:100, 29:34, 34:5, and\n45:11 (cf. also 6:125 with rijs).\n534 ghaḍiba", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Explicit statements about divine wrath like Q 1:7 therefore mark an ap-\npreciable development in Qur’anic theology, an anthropopathic enrichment of the Qur’an’s\nconceptual resources for representing the deity.\nDivine wrath in the Medinan surahs. The Medinan portions of the Qur’an include\nfurther references to God’s wrath. Three surahs continue the association of God’s wrath\nspecifically with the Israelites or with the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb; Q 2:61.90,\n3:112, 5:60; see also Reynolds 2020, 166–167 and 169–171). But once again, o thers, too, run\nthe risk of incurring God’s anger if they intentionally kill a believer (Q 4:93), are guilty\nof cowardice before the e nemy (Q 8:16), or are hypocrites or associators who “think evil\nthoughts of God” (al-ẓ ānnīna bi- llāhi ẓanna l- sawʾi; Q 48:6). Q 24:6–9 outline an ordeal-\nlike procedure for situations in which a husband accuses his wife of adultery without being\nable to produce any witnesses other than himself. It is stipulated that the husband is to\ncall down God’s “curse” upon himself should he lie (v. 7: anna laʿnata llāhi ʿalayhi in kāna\nmina l- kādhibīn), but that the accused wife can avert h uman punishment by invoking God’s\n“wrath” on herself should he tell the truth (v. 9: anna ghaḍaba llāhi ʿalayhā in kāna mina\nl- ṣādiqīn). The operative assumption is clearly that if either of the two parties is culpable,\nhe or she will fall victim to God’s ire either in the pre sent world or in the hereafter, thus\nobviating the need for human intervention. The same association of God’s wrath and his\ncurse (verb: laʿana, noun: laʿnah) is also seen in some other Medinan verses, namely,\nQ 4:93, 5:60, and 48:6. Two further, more enigmatic Medinan references to divine wrath\nare found in Q 58:14 and 60:13, according to which one must not “take as allies” (tawallā)\n“a people who are subject to God’s wrath” (qawman ghaḍiba llāhu ʿalayhim). It is con-\nceivable that this is a reference to the Israelites/Jews or the scripture- owners, given other\nverses that depict them as subject to divine wrath (thus, e.g., Reynolds 2020, 290, n. 29).\nGeneral remarks on divine wrath and mercy in the Qur’an. The overall impression\nemerging from Qur’anic statements about divine wrath is that God’s anger, like his love and\nmercy (see again u nder → al- raḥmān), is proportionate to the ethico- religious standing of\nthe individuals who form its objects: divine anger is presented throughout as a response—\nno doubt an emotional response (Reynolds 2020, 162)—to grave prior wrongdoing, such\nas the Israelites’ worship of the Golden Calf. The fact that God’s stance t owards humans\nis a commensurate reaction to the stance that humans adopt towards God, and also to\nother humans, explains why there is ultimately no contradiction between God’s ability\nto be merciful and to be wrathful: both are diferential responses to dif er ent human be-\nhaviours. God’s diferential and proportionate responsiveness to h uman actions is, in fact,\nan impor tant general Qur’anic theme that manifests itself with regard to other concepts as\nwell. It is, for instance, reflected in bipartite statements employing the verbs → tāba (said\neither of penitent human “turning” towards God or God’s forgiving “turning” towards\nhumans), → nasiya (“to forget”), and → makara (“to plot or scheme”) or its synonym\nkāda: if humans penitently turn to God, he will forgivingly turn to them; if they forget\nGod, he w ill forget them; if they plot or scheme against God or his messengers, God w ill\noutscheme them.3\nThus, while the Qur’anic deity is credited with a wide range of anthropopathic states,\nthese states are ultimately expressive of a divine commitment to justice that surpasses any\n3 See also Q 17:8 (wa-i n udtum ʿudnā).\nghaḍiba 535", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In sum, it would be a mistake to view Qur’anic\n(or, for that matter, Biblical) ascriptions of divine wrath as primitive residues that are\nprogressively to be stripped away by loftier conceptions of the divine, or to think of divine\nemotions as something that is bound to cloud God’s justice (as suggested in Reynolds 2020,\n162). Rather, attributing to God emotional states like love and wrath plays the vital role of\nexplaining why an omnipotent, omniscient, and eternal divine being would sufficiently\ncare about rights and wrongs in the human sphere in order to do anything about them. The\nimplied answer to this question is that human deeds have an emotional resonance in God,\nthereby disposing him to react to them in specific ways. God is not “hurt or wronged” by\nunbelief and sin, which from the Qur’anic perspective would inacceptably imply his vul-\nnerability (Marshall 1999, 86).4 But the Qur’anic God is nonetheless emotionally attuned\nto and afected by the moral valence of human actions.\nThis entry is appropriately concluded by noting that Qur’anic recourse to the notion of\ndivine wrath remains overall much less significant in quantitative terms than statements\nabout the objective consequences of such wrath, both in the pre sent world and the here-\nafter. This is clearly shown by comparing the Qur’an’s 24 occurrences of the root gh- ḍ- b\nwith its more than 300 instances of the noun ʿadhāb, “punishment,” and the 41 occurrences\nof the verb → ʿadhdhaba, “to punish,” both of which are found from the early Meccan to\nthe Medinan surahs. This apparent tendency to affirm the basic applicability of anthro-\npopathic language to God while keeping statements about God’s interior states within\nrelatively narrow limits resembles the Qur’an’s similarly cautious and selective espousal\nof anthropomorphic language (see under → allāh).\nExcursus: Are the References to God’s Wrath in Surahs 7 and 20 Insertions?\nAs noted above, Angelika Neuwirth has claimed that the references to God’s wrath found\nin the accounts of the Israelites’ worship of the Golden Calf in Surahs 7 and 20 are Me-\ndinan additions (Neuwirth 2004; Neuwirth 2010, 518–524; Neuwirth 2017, 342–344). In\nthe pre sent context, the relevant verses that she identifies as Medinan are Q 20:80–82 and\n7:152–153. With regard to Q 20:80–82, her main argument is that the vocative “O Israelites”\n(yā- banī isrāʾīla) opening v. 80 is most likely an address of the Medinan Jews, leading her\nto infer that the entire verse group is therefore Medinan (Neuwirth 2004, 79; Neuwirth\n2010, 522–523; Neuwirth 2017, 342–343). Neuwirth furthermore highlights the reference,\nin Q 20:80, to God’s bestowal of “manna and quails” upon the Israelites (wa-n azzalnā\nʿalaykumu l- manna wa- l- salwā), and the demand, in Q 20:81, that the Israelites eat of the\n“good things” that God has “provided” for them without “committing excess” with regard\nto them (kulū min ṭayyibāti mā razaqnākum wa- lā taṭghaw fīhi), which she also considers\nto speak to a Medinan context (Neuwirth 2017, 342–343).\nThe presence of Medinan insertions in later Meccan surahs undeniably requires further\nanaly sis. It is likely or even probable, for instance, that Surah 7 does indeed include\n4 In support of the Qur’anic assumption of divine invulnerability, Marshall references Q 3:177 and 11:57.

The sec-\nondary nature of Q 20:80–82 and 7:152–153, however, cannot be accepted as having been\nproven to any standard of probability. For one, the presence of a vocative address of the\nIsraelites in Q 20:80 is in no way conclusive. To be sure, of the six Qur’anic occurrences of\n“O Israelites,” five are found in Medinan surahs (Q 2:40.47.122, 5:72, 61:6). Yet Q 20:80 is\namenable to being read as a divine address of the historical Israelites at the time of Moses,\njust as the divine voice addresses Moses himself in v. 83 (“What caused you to hasten away\nfrom your p eople, O Moses?,” wa- mā aʿjalaka ʿan qawmika yā- mūsā).5 Thus interpreted,\nthe address in Q 20:80 is comparable to cases in which Qur’anic depictions of the last\njudgement shift to a direct divine address of the saved (see Q 43:68 and 89:27; cf. also 82:6\nand 84:6, although these latter two verses are more ambivalent). One might also note God’s\ndirect address of the Israelites in Q 7:141 (“And [remember] when we delivered youp from\nthe people of Pha raoh”) and Q 17:4 (“And we decreed to the Israelites in the scripture,\n‘Twice youp will wreak corruption in the land and rise to g reat height’ ”). Moreover, even\nif it were granted that the addressees of Q 20:80 are con temporary rather than historical\nIsraelites, it is not obvious that this is inconceivable prior to the hijrah (see QP 321, citing\nQ 27:76), however much it remains true that the Meccan proclamations lack the same\ndegree of detailed discursive engagement with and polemical confrontation of Jews and\nJudaism that is seen in the Medinan surahs (see under → al- yahūd).\nAnother prob lem is that extricating Q 20:80–82 would leave behind a jarring gap in\nthe text, namely, a sudden leap from v. 79 (“Pha raoh led astray his people and did not\nguide [them]”) to v. 83 (“What caused you to hasten away from your people, O Moses?”).\nThe Israelites’ deliverance from their pursuers, to be sure, is alluded to in v. 78, but the\nnarrative setting required by Moses’s discovery of the Israelites’ worship of the Golden\nCalf in vv. 83 f. is only supplied by v. 80 (“we made an appointment to meet youp on the\nright side of the mountain,” wa-w āʿadnākum jāniba l- ṭūri l-a ymana).6 There are, more-\nover, significant lexical links between the verse group Q 20:80–82, on the one hand, and\nwhat precedes and what follows, on the other: vv. 81 and 86 threaten the Israelites with\nthe “alighting” (ḥalla) of God’s “wrath” (ghaḍab; cf. also the use of ghaḍbān in v. 86);\nderivatives of the root w- ʿ-d occur in vv. 80, 86, 87, and 97; the root gh-f -r in v. 82 echoes\nv. 73; and the root t-w -b occurs in vv. 82 and 122, in both cases followed, at the end of\nthe respective verse, by derivatives of h-d -y . There is also the correspondence between\nthe vocative addressing the Israelites at the beginning of v. 80 (yā-b anī isrāʾīla) and the\nvocative addressing Moses at the end of v. 83 (yā- mūsā), creating a sequence in which\nthe divine voice first turns to the Israelite public and then to their leader individually. All\nof this generates a robust prima facie impression that vv. 80–82 are well integrated into\ntheir pre sent literary environment.\n5 Neuwirth correctly notes that the speaker of the address “O Israelites” is unlikely to be Moses, who em-\nploys the vocative “O my people” (yā- qawmi) in Q 20:86 (Neuwirth 2017, 342). But the fact that the speaker of\nQ 20:80–82 is evidently God (which emerges even more clearly from the use of the first person plural anjaynā-\nkum) does not preclude that the addressees are the ancient Israelites.\n6 In Neuwirth’s most recent analy sis of Surah 20, an objectionable narrative leap between Q 20:79 and\n20:83 is avoided by her auxiliary claim that the Medinan insertion at hand is not l imited to vv. 80–82 but includes\nvv. 77–79 as well (Neuwirth 2017, 341–342). But apart from the fact that the diction of vv. 77–79 is completely\ninconspicuous in a Meccan surah, this widening of the alleged interpolation only shifts the narrative leap to the\ntransition from v. 76 (which concludes Moses’s confrontation with the Egyptian sorcerers) to v. 83. In fact, the\nresulting gap is even more severe.\nghaḍiba 537", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But the explanatory cost entailed by ex-\ncising vv. 80–82 is unnecessarily high, given that t hese three verses exhibit little give-\naway Medinan terminology. For instance, it is by no means the case that the notion of\nrepentance or of God’s conciliatory “turning towards” humans (t-w -b ; see vv. 82 and\nunder → tāba) is exclusively Medinan (see, e.g., Q 11:3.52.61.90.112, 40:7, and 46:15, in\naddition to 20:122). The same goes for the concatenation of “to believe” (āmana) and\n“to act righ teously” (→ ʿamila ˻ṣāliḥan) in v. 82, which appears already in some Meccan\nsurahs (e.g., Q 28:67.80 and 34:37); and there are also further Meccan verses employing\nthe notion of God’s wrath (ghaḍab), namely, Q 7:71, 16:106, and 42:16. Moreover, the\naffirmation that God “delivered” the Israelites from (anjaynākum min) their enemies\nin Q 20:80 has a parallel in 7:141 (cf. also 14:8 and 26:65), and the statement that God\n“made an appointment” (wāʿada) with the Israelites at Mount Sinai, also in Q 20:80, is\nparalleled, in more detail, by Q 7:142.7\nThe one elem ent of Q 20:80–81 whose Qur’anic parallels are likely to be exclusively\nMedinan is God’s sending down of manna and quails (v. 80), followed by the injunction\nto eat of the “good t hings” that God has provided (v. 81). The only other Qur’anic verses\nin which this combination is found are Q 2:57 and 7:160. Of these two verses, the former\nbelongs to a surah generally accepted as Medinan, while the latter may well be a Medinan\ninsertion (see under → al- asbāṭ). But at least appeals that God has “provided” (→ razaqa)\nhumans in general and the Israelites in par tic u lar with “good things” (ṭayyibāt), which\nmust not be arbitrarily spurned and declared to be forbidden, occur in Meccan passages\nas well (e.g., Q 7:32, 45:16; for more detail, see u nder → ḥarrama). The reference to the\nIsraelites’ receiving manna and quails in Q 20:80 is therefore not obviously out of place in\na Meccan surah, even if the narrative detail as such, which is evidently Biblical (see Exod\n16 and Num 11 as well as BEQ 294), has no other Meccan counterpart.\nIn sum, the claim that Q 20:80–82 are Medinan is unproven. Similar objections may\nbe raised against the position that Q 7:152–153 are Medinan. For instance, the root gh- ḍ-b ,\nfound in Q 7:152, also occurs in vv. 150 and 154; and the verbs ʿamila, tāba, and āmana\nfrom v. 153 are by no means characteristically Medinan, as shown by the references\ngiven above.\nghafara tr./intr.

On the most likely construal, ghulf is a plural adjective whose Qur’anically\nunattested singular is aghlaf, which is standardly glossed as “enwrapped in a covering” (e.g.,\nṬab. 2:228–230). Both al- Ṭabarī and al- Zamaksharī hold that aghlaf can also, or primarily,\nmean “uncircumcised” (Ṭab. 2:227; Zam. 1:294; see also AEL 2284), and al- Zamaksharī\nexplic itly identifies the application of the word aghlaf to the Israelites’ hearts as a meta phor\n(mustaʿārun mina l-a ghlafi lladhī lam yukhtan; see also the discussion in Reynolds 2010a,\n149–151). The reliability of the equation of aghlaf specifically with “uncircumcised,” rather\nthan just “covered,” has been questioned (AHW 74 and 184–185); but it is found as early as\nAbū ʿUbaydah, who explains that aghlaf is “anything that is in a covering (ghilāf), and it is said,\n‘a sword that is in a covering’ (sayf aghlaf) and ‘a bow that is in a covering’ (qaws ghalfāʾ),\nand ‘a man who is in a covering’ (rajul aghlaf), when he has not been circumcised (idhā lam\nyakhtatin)” (Abū ʿUbaydah 1955–1962, 1:46; see also Ibn Qutaybah 1978, 57).\nAn impor tant further datum bearing on the meaning of the word aghlaf is the fact\nthat the formulation “Our hearts are ghulf” from Q 2:88 and 4:155 resembles a Meccan\npassage describing the obduracy of what are presumably Muhammad’s pagan adversaries,\nQ 41:5: “They say, ‘Our hearts are separated by covers from that to which you are calling\nus’ ” (wa- qālū qulūbunā fī akinnatin mimmā tadʿūnā ilayhi; see SQ 42–43 and 1158–1159).\nThis inter- Qur’anic link gives rise to two basic interpretive possibilities. First, one might\nconsider ghulf in Q 2:88 and 4:155 to be synonymous with fī akinnah, “ under covers,” in\nQ 41:5, in accordance with those Muslim exegetes who simply employ the latter formu-\nlation as a gloss in order to elucidate the former (see, e.g., Ṭab. 2:228, quoting Ibn ʿAbbās\nas equating ghulf with fī akinnah). On this reading, “Our hearts are ghulf” would have no\ndistinctive meaning over and above “Our hearts are under covers” from Q 41:5 (thus, ap-\nparently, the preference in AHW 184–185). Alternatively, one might instead suppose, with\nAbū ʿUbaydah and o thers, that the dif er ent formulation used in Q 2:88 and 4:155 has a\npartially distinctive semantic content from 41:5, in so far as it evokes a glans enveloped by\nforeskin, thus representing the coveredness of the Israelites’ hearts by an extraordinarily\nconcrete physiological meta phor.\nThe interest of the question stems largely from the fact that on the second option, the\nIsraelites’ alleged utterance “Our hearts are uncircumcised” could be understood as an\necho of Biblical accusations attributing an “uncircumcised” (ʿārēl, Peshitta: ʿūrlā) heart to\nGod’s p eople (e.g., Lev 26:41 and 9:25; cf. Jer 4:4; see WMJA 12; JPND 186–187; CQ 157–158;\nBEQ 444; Reynolds 2010a, 152–155; on circumcision of the heart in the Bible, see also\nTDOT 7:433–434).

This attack would have been founded on the verifiable textual fact that the\nJews’ very own scriptures accuse their b earers of having uncircumcised hearts. A similarly\npolemical exploitation of a specific Biblical formulation can be seen in the Jews’ alleged\nstatement samiʿnā wa- ʿaṣaynā, “We hear and disobey” (Q 2:93, 4:46), which turns a Biblical\ndeclaration of fidelity to God’s law (Deut 5:27: šāmaʿnû wә- ʿāśînû, “We w ill hear and do\n[it]”) into another expression of Israelite defiance (→ samiʿa).\nIt must be stressed that when al- Ṭabarī and al- Zamaksharī suggest that aghlaf means\n“uncircumcised,” they demonstrate no awareness that this lexical piece of information\ntallies with a reading of Q 2:88 and 4:155 as alluding to a Biblical trope. Moreover, t here\nis no evident reason why early Muslim exegetes would have been tempted to invent the\nlexical piece of information that aghlaf can mean “uncircumcised,” rather than confining\nthemselves to glossing the word as “covered.” Given the Biblical background just intimated,\nit does not seem to be an accident that the term ghulf is employed specifically in connec-\ntion with the hearts of the Israelites, whereas Q 41:5, which seems to be directed against\nnon- Jewish opponents, opts for dif er ent diction. At the same time, it is likely that the\nQur’an’s original readers would have heard the phrase “Our hearts are ghulf” as a variant\non Q 41:5’s “Our hearts are under covers,” qulūbunā fī akinnatin. Quite possibly, the term\nghulf was deliberately chosen for its multivalence, connoting both covering and lack of\ncircumcision. A translation along the lines of “wrapped in foreskins” gives due prominence\nto both semantic factors at play.\nThe contention that Q 2:88 and 4:155 put a Biblical trope to polemical use is further\nstrengthened by the fact that Christian discourse ofers pertinent precursors, as noted\nalready by Karl Ahrens and documented in further detail by Gabriel Reynolds (CQ 157–\n158; Reynolds 2010a, 153–155). For instance, Stephanus, in his speech before the high\npriest in Acts 7:1–53 that ends in his stoning, addresses his hearers as “you stif- necked\npeople, uncircumcised in heart and ears” (aperitmētoi kardiais kai tois ōsin, Peshitta:\nd-l ā gzīrīn b-l ebbhon wa-b -m ashmaʿthon; Acts 7:51), and Lev 26:41 is explic itly cited in\nJustin’s apol o getic dialogue with a fictional Jewish interlocutor (Dialogue with Trypho\n16 = Roberts et al. 1995, 1:202). As Reynolds shows, the trope of uncircumcised hearts is\nalso deployed by Origen and John Chrysostom as well as by Syriac authors like Aphrahat\nand Ephrem, often in anti- Jewish contexts. Particularly noteworthy about the parallel\nfrom Acts is that Stephanus’s address of his hearers as “uncircumcised in hearts and\nears” is followed by the charge that the addressees’ ancestors persecuted and killed the\nprophets (Acts 7:52). The same combination of uncircumcision of the heart and killing\nthe prophets is also found in Q 2:87–88 and 4:155 (Reynolds 2010a, 154), providing yet\nfurther confirmation that the use of ghulf, in contrast with Q 41:5’s fī akinnah, taps into\nanti- Jewish polemical language.\nmaghlūl | fettered\n→ allāh, → al- yahūd\nghill | rancour\n→ jannah, → ṣadr\n540 maghlūl", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Al-g hayb is the verbal noun corresponding to ghāba, “to\nbe absent, hidden, concealed.” In its Qur’anic usage, the term encompasses vari ous cat-\negories of things that are empirically inaccessible to humans (and also, according to\nQ 34:14, to the → jinn) yet are fully transparent to God, who is repeatedly said to be “the\none who knows what is hidden and what is observable” (ʿālim al-g hayb wa-l -s hahādah;\nQ 6:73, 9:94.105, 13:9, 23:92, 32:6, 39:46, 59:22, 62:8, 64:18)1 or, emphasising the com-\nprehensive reach of his knowledge, to know “what is hidden in the heavens and on earth”\n(Q 2:33, 35:38, 49:18; cf. similarly 11:123, 16:77, 18:26). Other verses explic itly assert the\nexclusiveness of God’s access to al-g hayb (see Q 6:59, 10:20, 27:65). In this sense, the\ndistinction between the hidden and what can be witnessed is “a distinction made purely\nfrom the human point of view, for, from the standpoint of God, there can be no ghayb\nat all” (GMK 83).\nGod being the one who has sole and full knowledge of the things that are concealed\nfrom humans, it is his prerogative to inform them of it. Such communication of al-g hayb\nis described with the verbs aṭlaʿa, “to give s.o. insight into s.th.” (Q 3:179), → awḥā,\n“to convey” (Q 3:44, 11:49, 12:102), and nabbaʾa, “to announce (Q 9:94.105, 62:8). God\ndoes not make his grasp of al-g hayb apparent to anyone (fa-l ā yuẓhiru ʿalā ghaybihi\naḥadā), except for such messengers as he is pleased with (illā mani rtaḍā min rasūlin;\nQ 72:26–27). The Qur’anic proclaimer accordingly disavows any pretension to being\nendowed with in de pen dent knowledge of al-g hayb (e.g., Q 6:50, 7:188, 11:31), although\nhe is also cleared from any suspicion of withholding those insights into al-g hayb that\nhave been imparted to him (Q 81:24). To believe, in the Qur’anic understanding, is to\nbelieve (→ āmana) in things that are “hidden” (Q 2:3), such as the coming of an escha-\ntological judgement, and the Qur’an accordingly condemns those who will only believe\n1 The basic meaning of shahādah is “testimony, witnessing” (see Q 5:106); see CDKA 153.\nal- ghayb 541", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

One usage of the\nterm ghayb is in connection with events in the remote past. Thus Q 3:44, 11:49, and 12:102\nrefer to accounts of Mary, Noah, and Joseph as belonging to anbāʾ al- ghayb, “tidings of the\nhidden,”3 and Q 18:26 asserts God’s knowledge of “what is hidden in the heavens and on\nearth” in connection with the precise number of years that the “Companions of the Cave”\nspent asleep.4 The hereafter also comes under the rubric of the hidden: in Q 19:61, God is\nsaid to have promised his servants the Gardens of Eden bi- l- ghayb, plausibly taken to mean\nwhile t hese gardens are not yet pre sent or not yet objects of h uman visual perception (see\nZam. 4:34). It would appear to be by the same logic that other verses praise t hose who\nfear God bi- l- ghayb (Q 5:94, 21:49, 35:18, 36:11, 50:33, 67:12), namely, those who fear him\ndespite the fact that he is not an object of ordinary human perception and therefore is\nhidden (although he is of course presumed to be a pos si ble object of human knowledge).5\nGiven that Q 21:49 pairs fear of God bi- l- ghayb with being afraid (ashfaqa) of the eschato-\nlogical hour, one may speculate that God’s hiddenness or absence from visual perception,\nhis being in a state of ghayb, is a condition obtaining specifically as long as the hour has\nnot yet come to pass; when it does, the divine judge w ill be fully apparent and, indeed,\nvis i ble (cf. Q 75:22–23 and see under → allāh). The ghayb to which God has unrestricted\naccess also includes interior human states: Q 35:38 predicates of God knowledge of “what\nis hidden in the heavens and on earth” and then goes on to say that he knows “what is in\nthe breasts,” and Q 5:116 makes a similar connection between God’s knowledge of what is\nhidden and his knowledge of what is in humans’ souls. In Q 2:33, God’s knowledge of “what\nis hidden in the heavens and on earth” is evoked in connection both with his knowledge\nof the names of the creatures subsequently taught to Adam and of what the angels might\nbe concealing from him. In Q 49:18, God’s knowledge of the ghayb of the heavens and the\nearth figures next to his full knowledge of “what you are doing” (see also Q 62:8).\nThe preceding synchronic digest of the Qur’anic notion of “the hidden” may be comple-\nmented by two diachronic remarks. First, the term ghayb appears already in a number of\nearly Meccan verses (Q 52:41, 53:35, 68:47, 81:24), and in this sense is part of the Qur’anic\nlexicon virtually from the outset. Secondly, however, the early Meccan proclamations do not\nyet oppose al- ghayb to al- shahādah. Instead, one early Meccan oath, Q 69:38–39, expresses\nthe contrast between vis i ble and invisible things in entirely dif er ent terminology: “No,\nI swear by what you see (mā tubṣirūn) // and by what you do not see (mā lā tubṣirūn)!”6\nThe earliest passage employing the contrast between al- ghayb and al- shahādah is perhaps\nQ 23:92, which postdates the transition to the l ater Meccan surahs (mean verse length:\n56.86 transliteration letters) and is one of the verses calling God “the one who knows what\nis hidden and what is observable” (ʿālim al- ghayb wa- l- shahādah).\n2 As Ringgren notes, t hese verses are highly reminiscent of New Testamental statements contrasting faith\nand sight like 2 Cor 5:7 or John 20:29 (see also below).\n3 On Q 11:49 in par tic u lar, see also under → ˻asāṭīr al- awwalīn.\n4 See also Q 18:22, where dif er ent human views about the number of the Companions of the Cave are\ndescribed as rajm bi- l- ghayb, roughly “casting guesses at the hidden.”\n5 At Q 12:52—w here Joseph declares that he has not betrayed his master bi- l- ghayb— the phrase is amenable\nto being paraphrased as “in his absence.”\n6 I owe this reference to Saqib Hussain.\n542 al- ghayb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic use of the term ghayb to denote what is absent or epistemologically\ninaccessible to h umans is broadly continuous with its occurrence in pre-I slamic poetry.\nFor instance, a line from the Zuhayr corpus describes a wild cow searching out “what is\nhidden in many a tangle of trees” (ghayba kulli khamīlatin; DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 3:19; for\nother occurrences, see Arazi and Masalha 1999, 818, and GMK 84),7 while ʿAbīd ibn al-\nAbraṣ avers: “Every one absent on a journey (kullu dhī ghaybatin) can return, but the one\nwhose absence is caused by death (ghāʾib al- mawt) will not return” (Lyall 1913, no. 1:16;\nEAP 1:37).8 Going back to a far earlier period, the first millennium BCE, the deity ḏġbt\n(Dhū Ghaybat), “Master of the Unseen” (?), was worshipped in a sanctuary near Dadān/\nal- ʿUlā in the northern Ḥijāz (Al- Jallad 2022, 2).\nIf we turn our attention to the Qur’anic opposition between al- ghayb and al- shahādah\nin par tic ul ar, however, the relevant comparative material turns out to be Christian rather\nthan Arabian. Specifically, the contrast between al- ghayb and al- shahādah is reminiscent\nof the juxtaposition of “all t hings vis ib le and invisible” (Greek: ta horata kai ta aorata, Syr-\niac: koll d- metḥzē w- koll d- lā metḥzē) in the ancient Christian hymn cited in Col 1:16 (“For\nin him all t hings w ere created, t hings in heaven and on earth, vis ib le and invisible . . .”),\nwhence the dichotomy also found its way into the Niceno- Constantinopolitan Creed (for\nmore on horatos vs aoratos, see TDNT 5:368–380). Efectively the same contrast, which the\nSyriac Peshitta renders almost identically, is found in 2 Cor 4:18, according to which “we\nlook not on t hose that are seen (ta blepomena, hālēn d- metḥazyān), but at t hose that are\nnot seen (ta mē blepomena, hālēn d- lā metḥazyān).” Also relevant is Heb 11: a fter defining\nfaith as “the conviction of t hings not seen” (pragmatōn elenchos ou blepomenōn; v. 1),9 the\nauthor goes on to maintain that “that which is seen” (to blepomenon) did not come to be\n“from t hings that are apparent” (ek phainomenōn; v. 3). H ere, too, the Peshitta standardises\nthe diction, stating that “the t hings that are vis ib le” (hālēn d- metḥazyān) came to be from\n“the things that are invisible” (aylēn d- lā metḥazyān).10 The merit of belief without seeing\nis also stressed at the end of the New Testamental narrative of the incredulity of Thomas\n(John 20:29), where Jesus blesses “t hose who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”\nThe theme of faith in t hings unseen continues to pervade post- Biblical Christian discourse,\nsuch as Chrysostom’s interpretation of John 20:29, which ties the verse to Heb 11:1 (Schaf\n1995, 14:327 = Chrysostom, Homilies on the Gospel of St John, no. 87), or Augustine’s On Faith\nin Th ings Unseen (Augustine 1947, 443–469).11 Incidentally, both Heb 11:1 and John 20:29\nstrongly resonate not only with the Qur’anic notion of belief in al- ghayb but also with the\nQur’anic critique of t hose who will not believe “u ntil they see (verb: raʾā)” in verses like\nQ 26:201 (see already Ringgren 1951, 14–15, who additionally quotes 2 Cor 5:7).\nDespite the pertinence of the preceding parallels, the Qur’anic understanding of al-\nghayb is nonetheless distinctive. The New Testamental statements just rehearsed evoke, or\n7 Another verse cited by Izutsu, attributed to ʿAntarah, does not seem to be contained in the recension of\nal- Shantamarī edited by Ahlwardt.\n8 See also Abū l- Faraj al- Iṣbahānī 1927–1974, 14:154, l. 11.\n9 The Peshitta has gelyānā d- aylēn d- lā metḥazyān, “a revelation of the things not seen.”\n10 For a similar observation regarding the Syriac root d-ḥ - l, used in the Peshitta to render a variety of Hebrew\nand Greek terms to do with fear and thereby “causing a focalization on one term,” see Becker 2009, 311–317 and\n329–330 (citing p. 314).\n11 I am grateful to Nora K.

The Qur’anic understanding of al- ghayb, by contrast, does not invite such an onto-\nlogical reading: al- ghayb is explic itly said to encompass historical events unfolding in the\nhuman sphere, whose hiddenness is simply due to the fact that no cont emporary of the\nQur’an has reliable first-h and access to them anymore; and in the Qur’an the contrast of of\nal- ghayb vs al- shahādah only ever figures in the formulation ʿālim al- ghayb wa- l- shahādah,\n“the one who knows what is hidden and what is observable.” The Qur’anic concept of\n“the hidden,” consequently, is squarely epistemological. Genealogically, it may very well\nbe a resonance of the phraseology of Col 1:16 and similar passages; but the formulation is\nnonetheless woven quite organically into the Qur’an’s non- dualistic ontology.\n544 al- ghayb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

According to a long-s tanding\nscholarly hypothesis whose foundations w ere laid in 1833 by Abraham Geiger, Qur’anic\nfurqān reflects Aramaic, and perhaps specifically Syriac, pūrqānā, “deliverance, salvation”\n(WMJA 55–56; Sprenger 1869, 2:337–338; GQ 1:34; NB 23–24; Rudolph 1922, 39–40; JPND\n216–218; KU 76–77; FVQ 225–229). More recently, this theory has been substantially mod-\nified by one scholar (Donner 2007) and discarded by another (Saleh 2015). The pre sent\nentry w ill nonetheless endorse the conventional link between furqān and pūrqānā. Before\nattempting to delineate the likely meaning of the word furqān, however, it will be helpful\nto commence with a descriptive cata logue of its Qur’anic usage. To this efect, one may\ndistinguish two general thematic contexts of the term: in five verses, the definite singular\nal- furqān is associated with the phenomenon of divine revelation, while two other verses\nwould seem to apply furqān to a military triumph or an act of divine deliverance through\nvictory in battle (NB 23–24; Lidzbarski 1922, 91; CDKA 212).\nReferences to al- furqān in connection with divine revelation. The word’s link with\ndivine revelation is clearest in Q 25:1 and 3:3–4. According to the former verse, God “sent\ndown (nazzala) the furqān upon his servant”— i.e., upon Muhammad— “so that he might\nbe a warner to the world- dwellers.” Similarly, Q 3:3–4 proclaims that God “sent down”\n(→ nazzala) “the scripture” (→ al- kitāb) upon the Qur’anic Messenger after having previ-\n546 firʿawn", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

According to Q 21:48, God “gave” (ātaynā) Moses and Aaron\n“the furqān, illumination (ḍiyāʾ), and reminding exhortation (dhikr; → dhakkara) for the\nGod- fearing.” In Q 2:53, meanwhile, the divine voice addresses the Israelites by affirming\nthat “we gave Moses the scripture and the furqān, so that youp might be guided (laʿal-\nlakum tahtadūn).” The fifth and last occurrence of al-f urqān in connection with divine\nrevelation is found later on in Surah 2, in Q 2:185. H ere, the addressees are told that it\nwas in the month of Ramaḍān that “the Qur’anic recitations were sent down” (unzila fīhi\nl-q urʾān), “as guidance for the people and as clear signs of guidance and of the furqān”\n(hudan li- l- nāsi wa- bayyinātin mina l-h udā wa- l- furqāni). As Fred Donner has observed,\nit would seem that in Q 2:185 al- furqān “constitutes the intent or purpose of revelation—\njust as guidance (hudā), with which it is more or less equated, is the goal or purpose of\nthe Qurʾān” (Donner 2007, 280). In other words, unlike al- tawrāh and al- injīl, al- furqān\nis not the proper name of a specific scripture, as one might have concluded from Q 25:1 or\n3:3–4 taken in isolation, but rather stands for something more general that is conveyed or\nrealised through individual scriptures or revelations.\nThe five occurrences just examined share a number of lexical and thematic commonal-\nities apart from the noun furqān itself, thus reinforcing the sense that they form a cluster\nof thematically and lexically associated passages. Specifically:\n(i) In Q 3:4 and 25:1, “the furqān” is the direct object of the verbs nazzala and anzala,\n“to send down,” and a more indirect connection between anzala and “the furqān”\nobtains in Q 2:185.\n(ii) In Q 2:53 and 21:48, “the furqān” is the direct object of ātā, “to give,” with the\nrecipient of the furqān in both cases being Moses.\n(iii) In Q 2:53.185, “the furqān” is linked with a derivative of the root h- d- y, which also\noccurs in Q 3:4. Moreover, that God’s sending down of the furqān served a broadly\nhortatory aim is also affirmed in Q 25:1 (“so that he might be a warner to the world-\ndwellers”), while Q 21:48 c ouples “the furqān” with God’s revelatory reminders\n(dhikr).\nFurqān as an event. Somewhat apart from the verses just surveyed stand the two\ninstances of furqān in Q 8:29.41, which are located in relatively close proximity. The\nformer verse is an appeal to the believers urging them to fear God so that he might\n“bring about a furqān for youp (yajʿal lakum furqānan) and absolve (→ kaffara) you of\nyour evil deeds and forgive you.” In v. 41, the Qur’an instructs the addressees that a fifth\nof all battle spoils are to be reserved for the Messenger and for charitable purposes, “if\nindeed youp believe in God and in what we sent down upon our servant on the day of\nthe furqān, when the two hosts met (yawma ltaqā l-j amʿāni).” In both cases, “a furqān”\n(v. 29) or “the furqān” (v. 41) would seem to refer to a kind of event or occurrence\nrather than to divine revelation or some general objective achieved through it. This is\nparticularly clear with re spect to Q 8:41, according to which “the day of the furqān”\nwas an encounter between two unidentified groups. The additional details given about\nthis encounter in vv. 42–44 suggest that we are dealing with one of the military clashes\nfurqān 547", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The phrase “the day on which the two hosts\nmet” (yawma ltaqā l-j amʿāni), furthermore, recurs in Q 3:155.166, where it also evokes\na military encounter.1 As for the question what, precisely, it is that God is said to have\n“sent down upon our servant on the day of the furqān,” as v. 41 puts it, Walid Saleh has\nmade the convincing suggestion that this refers to the angels who according to Q 8:9.12\naided the Qur’anic believers in battle (Saleh 2015, 68). It is true that in neither verse are\nthese angels explic itly described as having been “sent down,” but the collocation of the\nverbs anzala or nazzala with angels is attested elsewhere (e.g., Q 6:8.111).\nFurqān and pūrqānā. The obvious similarity between Arabic furqān and Jewish Ar-\namaic / Syriac pūrqānā (on which see DTTM 1148; DJBA 893; DJPA 427; SL 1172–1173)\nmakes the claim that the former is a loanword derived from the latter morphologically un-\nproblematic. The primary challenge that such an Aramaicising derivation of the term w ill\nhave to meet is to show that the Qur’anic use of furqān has intelligible semantic continuity\nwith its alleged Aramaic or Syriac pred e ces sor. This is unproblematic for Q 8:29.41, the\ntwo furqān-a s- event verses. In the Aramaic targums of the Bible and in the Syriac Peshitta,\npūrqānā translates Hebrew yәšûʿâ or tәšûʿâ, “salvation, redemption, deliverance,” which\ncan refer to God’s intervention in situations of individual or communal distress (see TDOT\n6:441–463, especially 456, and NIDOTTE 2:556–562). For example, both Targum Onqelos\nand the Peshitta render Jacob’s profession “I wait for your salvation (yәšûʿâ), O Lord” in\nGen 49:18 with the word pūrqānā. Biblical diction, moreover, afords pre ce dent for the\nphrase yawm al- furqān from Q 8:41. Thus, 1 Sam 11:13 has Saul declare after his victory over\nthe Ammonites that “ today the Lord has brought (ʿāśâ, Targum Jonathan and Peshitta:\nʿbad) deliverance (tәšûʿâ, Targum Jonathan and Peshitta: pūrqānā) to Israel,” and Isa 49:8\nspeaks of a “day of salvation” (yôm yәšûʿâ), which the Peshitta renders as yawmā d- furqānā\n(Lidzbarski 1922, 91–92; JPND 216; FVQ 226). Another relevant Biblical passage is Exod\n14:13, where Moses encourages the Israelites, who will shortly be crossing the Red Sea,\nwith the words, “See the deliverance (yәšûʿâ, Targum Onqelos and Peshitta: pūrqānā) that\nthe Lord will accomplish for you today” (Donner 2007, 289). Against this background, it\nseems reasonably certain that Q 8:29.41 are employing the word furqān in order to refer to\nan act of divine deliverance of the sort that figures in 1 Sam 11:13 or Exod 14:13, with the verb\njaʿala in Q 8:29 corresponding to Hebrew ʿāśâ and Aramaic ʿbad.2 The general meaning of\nfurqān in Q 8:29.41 is consequently similar to that of the phrase fatḥun mina llāhi, “a divinely\ngranted victory,” in Q 4:141 (see also 5:52 or 48:1.18.27, 110:1).3 Such an understanding is\n1 As Donner notes, it is not impossible to understand yajʿal lakum furqānan in Q 8:29 to allude to the\ntheme of divine revelation (Donner 2007, 280), perhaps by rendering the phrase as “so that he might grant you\na furqān- revelation” here. But jaʿala is not usually employed by the Qur‘an in order to refer to God’s granting of\nrevelations, and one would tend to assume that the word furqān has the same meaning in Q 8:29 as it does twelve\nverses later, in 8:41, at least barring compelling reasons to posit the contrary.\n2 I consider it improbable, though, that in light of Exod 14:13 we should understand Q 8:41 to refer to the\nIsraelites’ crossing of the Red Sea, as suggested by Donner 2007, 289. While it is true that the verse has lexical\noverlap (namely, the dual al- jamʿān, “the two hosts”) with Q 26:61, which does belong to a Qur’anic retelling of\nthe Red Sea episode, neither 8:41 nor the surrounding verses make any mention of the Israelites. What seems\nfar more likely is that Q 8:41 is describing a military encounter experienced by the Medinan believers in diction\nthat was meant to recall the e arlier Meccan account of the Israelites’ confrontation with Phar aoh and his army\n(see also Rubin 2009b, 427–428).\n3 Note that in Q 48:27 the noun fatḥ, “victory,” figures as the object of jaʿala, inviting comparison with yajʿal\nlakum furqānan in Q 8:29.\n548 furqān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

To put it in the words of Horovitz (JPND 217): “And yet how did it hap-\npen that a Jewish or Christian expression meaning ‘help,’ ‘salvation,’ was employed by\nMohammed himself in the signification of ‘revelation,’ which meaning is known of even\nin the [chronologically] first passages which employ the term?” Donner, for one, does\nnot think that this challenge can be met and instead proposes to emend at least three of\nthe revelatory occurrences of al-f urqān— namely, Q 2:53, 21:48, and 3:3–4, all of which\nname Moses or the Torah—to al-f uqdān, to be derived from Syriac pūqdānā, “command-\nment” (Donner 2007, 288–294). But even if one were to agree that this yields a feasible\nunderstanding of the three passages in question, to resolve an interpretive difficulty by\nmeans of an emendation that has no support in manuscripts or transmitted textual vari-\nants is quite a radical step, an interpreter’s ultima ratio. Donner’s hypothesis, moreover,\nwould require one to disregard the lexical affinity between Q 3:4, where he advocates\nemending furqān to fuqdān, and 25:1, where he is disinclined to do so, at least provided\nthat the “servant” upon whom the furqān is sent down according to 25:1 is identified with\nMuhammad (Donner 2007, 293).\nIn fact, the question posed by Horovitz is not as intractable as it may seem. It is cer-\ntainly not the case that the discrepancy between furqān- as- revelation and furqān- as- event\nforces one to treat one and the same word as designating two dif er ent concepts. After\nall, the Qur’anic term → āyah, “sign,” can span a similarly broad spectrum, being applied\nnot only to revelatory divine communications but also, among other t hings, to certain\ndivine acts in history. More specifically, there is nothing incongruous about the Qur’anic\nrevelations attributing a salvific status to themselves as well as to the Torah. It is, after all,\nby heeding God’s warnings and commandments that h umans will attain eschatological\nsalvation: within Qur’anic theology, God’s soteriologically decisive intervention in h uman\nhistory is his conveyance of revelations by means of vari ous prophetic spokesmen. Just\nas a solitary believer among the Egyptians is, in Q 40:41, reported to have addressed\nhis people by saying, “I call youp to salvation while you call me to the fire” (adʿūkum ilā\nl- najāti wa- tadʿūnanī ilā l- nār), so God’s revelatory guidance, as contained in the Torah\nand the Qur’an, “calls to salvation.” It would accordingly make good theological sense for\nthe Qur’an to describe God’s revelations with a “theological terminus technicus” (Sprenger\n1869, 2:337) referring to salvation or deliverance. As we saw above, furqān, when used in\nconnection with divine revelation, is closely associated with the root h- d- y, signifying di-\nvine guidance (Q 2:53.185, 3:4), and with divine exhortation and warning (Q 21:48, 25:1).\nWhen the Qur’an speaks of God’s sending down of al- furqān, therefore, as in Q 25:1, this\nmay be deemed to be approximately equivalent to the affirmation that he has “sent down\nclear signs and guidance” (Q 2:159: mā anzalnā mina l- bayyināti wa- l- hudā), a formulation\nclosely resembling the statement in Q 2:185 that the Qur’anic recitations w ere sent down\n“as guidance for the p eople and as clear signs of guidance and of al- furqān.” Overall, in\npassages like Q 25:1 or 3:3–4 al- furqān denotes “the enlightenment and guidance given by\nGod to man, especially through the medium of revelation” (Obermann 1941, 38; see simi-\nlarly Sprenger 1896, 2:339), and a reasonable translational approximation would therefore\nfurqān 549", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But t here is l ittle else to corroborate Gnostic\ninfluence on the Qur’an, and it is entirely conceivable that an expansion of the term furqān\nfrom “salvation” to “salvific revelation” was an in de pen dent Qur’anic development, given\nthat it is in line with the general thrust of Qur’anic theology. The Qur’an’s application of\nfurqān to divine revelation may also owe something to the morphological congruence of\nfurqān and qurʾān, “recitation” (→ qaraʾa),4 both of which can figure as an accusative object\nof the verbs nazzala or anzala (for furqān + n- z- l, see Q 3:4 and 25:1; for qurʾān + n- z- l, see\nQ 2:185, 5:101, 12:2, 17:82.106, 20:2.113, 25:32, 43:31, 59:21, 76:23). Extending the meaning of\nfurqān from “salvation” to “salvific revelation” would in any case hardly have been a drastic\nconceptual shift. In Ephrem’s sermon on Jonah and Nineveh, pūrqānā means “deliverance”\nnot in the sense of a divine intervention fending of some worldly threat or danger, as in 1\nSam 11:13, but rather signifies God’s abstention from obliterating sinful Nineveh. “Deliv-\nerance” or “salvation” here means the granting of divine pardon in view of the Ninevites’\nsincere penitence; it refers to the salvific consequence of the Ninevites’ response to the\npreaching of Jonah (see Beck 1970b, no. 1:86.220.876.911.1052). The Qur’an, then, simply\nretrojects the term “salvation” from the final outcome of this causal sequence (the avoid-\nance of divine wrath) to the act of divine communication that initiates the sequence (the\ndispatch of Jonah or, for that matter, of Muhammad as prophetic warners).\nFurqān and the Arabic root f- r- q. In the Islamic commentary tradition, the term fur-\nqān tends to be parsed in terms of the Arabic root f- r- q: furqān is usually construed as the\nverbal noun derived from the first-f orm verb faraqa and glossed, for instance, as something\nby means of which God “distinguished (faraqa) between truth and falsehood” (e.g., Ṭab.\n5:182–184, on Q 3:4; see generally Donner 2007, 281–286, and Saleh 2015, 51–60). That the\nsemantic payload of Qur’anic furqān might at least be partly determined by the meaning of\nthe Arabic root f- r- q has also been admitted by a number of Western scholars who accept the\nbasic derivation of furqān from Aramaic or Syriac pūrqānā (e.g., Sprenger 1869, 2:339–340;\nRudolph 1922, 39; NB 24). In defense of this position, it is generally plausible to assume that\nthe Qur’anic audience would have tended to understand the meaning of a loanword in line\nwith its perceived Arabic root. For instance, it may well be the case that the Qur’an’s address-\nees, and not only post- Qur’anic lexicographers, associated the noun → nabiyy, “prophet,”\nloaned from Hebrew nābîʾ or Aramaic/Syriac nbīyā, with the Arabic root n- b-ʾ and the verb\nnabbaʾa, “to announce, to tell.” Similarly, in the case of → al-ṭ āghūt, a collective noun that\nis best translated as “false gods” and descended from Ethiopic ṭāʿot (“idol, ungodliness”) or\nAramaic ṭaʿuta (“error”), it would seem that the precise Qur’anic form of the word bespeaks\nan association with the Arabic root ṭ-g h-w /y, conveying the general notion of transgression,\nexcess, and disobedience.\nNonetheless, t here is no explicit and specific Qur’anic evidence supporting the claim that\na furqān was indeed understood to be the act or a means of distinguishing between, say, truth\nand falsehood or belief and unbelief: none of the Qur’anic verses in which the first-f orm verb\nfaraqa or even the second-f orm verb farraqa (which appears, e.g., in Q 2:102.136.285 and\n4:150.152) are combined with the preposition bayna and in which faraqa or farraqa mean\n4 I owe this observation to Behnam Sadeghi.\n550 furqān", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Most pertinent is Q 5:25, where Moses asks God to “distinguish” between himself\nand his b rother Aaron, on the one hand, and the Israelite sinners who refused to enter the\nHoly Land, on the other (fa- fruq baynanā wa- bayna l- qawmi l- fāsiqīn). Based on this sole\nQur’anic occurrence of faraqa bayna + gen., one could perhaps propose that a furqān is\na divine act of separating out believers from unbelievers. But Q 5:25 is a Medinan verse,\nwhereas the word furqān appears already in Meccan surahs. Taking into consideration the\nadditional fact that no Qur’anic instance of furqān actually involves a prepositional com-\nplement introduced by bayna, “between,” the exegetes’ explanation of furqān appears like\nan ingenious piece of linguistic theorising without much basis in the a ctual text of scripture\n(see also Boisliveau 2014, 96). In sum, the proposed link between furqān and faraqa bayna,\n“to distinguish between . . . ,” is insufficiently explicit in order to justify translating furqān as\nGod’s “distinguishing guidance” or the like, rather than as “salvific instruction,” reflecting\nthe semantic contribution of the word’s Aramaic cognate.\nWalid Saleh, too, advocates construing the term furqān in terms of its Arabic root f- r- q,\nthough he does so in a markedly dif ere nt manner than the traditional approach just set out\n(Saleh 2015). Specifically, Saleh anchors his position in one par tic ul ar occurrence of faraqa,\n“to separate, to divide,” in Q 17:106, which describes the Qur’anic revelations as “a recitation\nthat we have divided (qurʾānan faraqnāhu) so that you may recite it to the p eople in an abiding\nmanner (ʿalā mukthin).”5 Against the background of this impor tant statement, Saleh submits\nthat the noun furqān—w hich he considers to be e ither a verbal noun derived from faraqa or\n“a plural of farq or furq (in the sense of a section)”6—a rticulates the “piecemeal” nature of\nthe Qur’an’s revelation (Saleh 2015, 41–42), namely, the fact that Muhammad proclaimed\nthe Qur’an in a serial manner over a considerable period of time.\nHowever, the prob lem with this proposal is that it locates the meaning of al-f urqān\nin what is prob ably understood to be a distinctive feature of the Qur’anic revelations as\nopposed to other divine revelations like the Torah or the Gospel. To be sure, the Qur’an does\nnot expressly rule out that when Moses was “given the scripture” (e.g., Q 2:53.87, 6:154, 11:110,\n17:2, 23:49) or when Jesus was “given” the Gospel (Q 5:46, 57:27), this could have happened\nin serial instalments. But t here is no positive confirmation of this possibility e ither, which\ncontrasts with statements in which Muhammad’s revelations are unequivocally said to have\nbeen “divided up” (Q 17:106) and not to have been conveyed as a “single w hole” (jumlatan\nwāḥidatan; Q 25:32). This creates the impression that the Qur’an does not consider the Torah\nto have been conveyed in the same “piecemeal” manner as Muhammad’s revelations. Yet as\nwe saw above, the Qur’an is quite unequivocal that Moses, too, and not just Muhammad, re-\nceived al- furqān (Q 2:53, 21:48; see already Boisliveau 2014, 96). This connection with Moses\nposes a significant obstacle to Saleh’s proposal that furqān signifies a “piecemeal revelation.”\nFurqān = “dawn”? Yet another attempt to interpret at least some Qur’anic occurrences\nof furqān in the sense of a native Arabic word has been made by Uri Rubin (Rubin 2009b).\n5 On ʿalā mukthin, see CDKA 257 and Saleh 2015, 41–43 (opting for the translation “as you live among them”).\nThe verb makatha (“to remain”) is well attested in the Qur’an (Q 13:17, 18:3, 20:10, 27:22, 28:29, 43:77).\n6 On plural nouns conforming to the pattern fuʿlān, see Wright 1974, 1:217–218 (e.g., dhiʾb, dhuʾbān). When\nSaleh allows that al- furqān could mean “the sections” or the like, corresponding to the plural of Hebrew pereq or\nAramaic pirqa, “section, chapter” (Saleh 2015, 65–66), this harks back to a suggestion first made by Hirschfeld\n(who also references Q 17:106) and Margoliouth (Hirschfeld 1902, 68; Margoliouth 1905, 145).

For instance, al- Azharī reports\nan utterance by an anonymous Bedouin in which saṭaʿa l-f urqān is used to mean “the\ndawn r ose,” with al- furqān being glossed as al- saḥar, the usual word for “dawn” (al-A zharī\n[1964–1976], 11:488; cf. AEL 2385). Rubin reasons that when al-A zharī equates al- furqān\nwith al- saḥar, this is highly unlikely to be a piece of lexical speculation constructed around\nthe Qur’an, especially seeing that the gloss just cited is not found under the lemma furqān\nitself but in explanation of ḍafaza bi- , “to have intercourse with s.o.,” without any obvious\nlink to scripture. Rubin therefore infers that these lexicographic data provide us with\ngenuinely early, and perhaps even pre- Islamic, Arabic usage. On this basis, Rubin argues\nthat when Q 2:185 or 3:3–4 describe divine revelations as al- furqān, they do so in the sense\nthat “scripture is a source of guiding light that leads one out of the darkness of ignorance”\n(Rubin 2009b, 424–425)—a meta phor that, he adds, is explicit in verses like Q 42:52, where\nthe Qur’anic revelations are described as a “light by which we guide those whom we will\nof our servants.” Rubin’s discovery that t here may have been a native Arabic meaning of\nfurqān could prob ably be integrated with most of what has been said so far: perhaps the\ntransference of furqān to a revelatory context was facilitated by the fact that the word, or\nrather a homonym of it, could also refer to the dawn.7 Nonetheless, before fully committing\noneself to this scenario one may prefer to await further evidence, in par tic u lar evidence\ndirectly drawn from collections of pre-I slamic poetry, that furqān was indeed employed\nto denote the daybreak.\niftarā tr.

The first-f orm verb fasada (“to become corrupted\nor ruined, to go to ruin”) appears only three times in the Qur’an, its grammatical subject\nbeing e ither the earth (Q 2:251), “the heavens and the earth” (Q 21:22; cf. 21:19), or “the\nheavens and the earth and every one in them” (Q 23:71). The fourth-f orm verb afsada can\ntake an accusative object and mean “to corrupt s.th.,” as shown by Q 27:34 (see below). Most\nconspicuously, however, the root f- s- d is employed in almost thirty verses, both Meccan\nand Medinan (e.g., Q 2:11.27.30.60.205.251, 7:56.74.85.127, 11:85.116), that collocate either the\nfourth- form verb afsada (“to wreak corruption”) or the noun fasād (“corruption”) with the\nprepositional phrase fī l- arḍ (“on earth” or “in the land”; → arḍ). The resulting expression\n“wreaking corruption on earth,” which unlike Q 27:34 employs afsada in an intransitive\nmanner, appears as early as Q 26:151–152, where the messenger Ṣāliḥ calls upon the p eople\nof Thamūd not to obey t hose who “wreak corruption on earth and do not put t hings right\n(wa- lā yuṣliḥūn).” Q 26:152 illustrates that most Qur’anic instances of the verb afsada and\nof its active participle mufsid are in the plural, thus conveying the distinct impression that\nthe wreaking of corruption has a prevalent communal dimension.1\nQ 26:152 additionally establishes that the antonym of afsada is aṣlaḥa, “to act right eously,\nto put t hings right,” or, when used transitively, “to put s.th. right, to put s.th. in good order.”\nThe contrast between afsada and aṣlaḥa recurs in other passages (Q 2:11.220, 7:56.85.142,\nand 27:48). Particularly in ter est ing among them are two later Meccan verses warning\nagainst “wreaking corruption on earth after it has been put in good order” (Q 7:56.85: wa-\nlā tufsidū fī l- arḍi baʿda iṣlāḥihā). This alludes to the flawlessness of God’s creation, a tenet\nthat is stressed throughout the Qur’an (see especially Q 67:3–4 and u nder → khalaqa). As\nfurther explained below, God has placed humans in a habitat that is supremely good and\nconducive to h uman flourishing, yet h uman actions may fall woefully short of correspond-\ning to this divinely set standard of perfection. An impor tant aspect of this train of thought\nis that the mood of cosmic alienation that pervades Gnosticism (Jonas 1988) and has also\nleft a significant imprint on the Christian tradition (e.g., Rom 8:20–22, cited in Zirker 1993,\n95) is entirely absent from the Qur’an; the world as such is unreservedly good; corruption\nonly enters it at the hands of humans.\nQur’anic occurrences of afsada or of the noun fasād that are unaccompanied by\nthe prepositional syntagm fī l-a rḍ are relatively rare (e.g., Q 2:220, 27:34).2 Most such\ninstances are prob ably due to the fact that the plural participle mufsidīn is a con ve-\nnient rhyme word (Q 3:63, 7:86.103.142, 10:40.81.91, 16:88, 27:14, 28:4, 29:30), such that\nthe absent syntagm fī l-a rḍ may almost be considered to have a virtual presence here.\n1 I owe this observation to Holger Zellentin.\n2 At Q 2:12, al- mufsidūn comes immediately after the occurrence of lā tufsidū fī l- arḍi in the preceding verse;\n30:41 says that corruption (al- fasād) has appeared “ashore and at sea” (fī l- barri wa- l- baḥri). Q 89:11–12 would\nseem to employ fī l- bilād where later passages might have fī l- arḍ, for reasons of rhyme.\nafsada 553", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This makes it pos si ble to combine verse- final\nmufsidīn with a prepended fī l-a rḍ. Three verses employ saʿā fī l-a rḍi fasādan (Q 5:33.64)\nor saʿā fī l-a rḍi li- yufsida fihā (Q 2:205) as paraphrastic equivalents of afsada fī l-a rḍ. As\nParet suggests, these variants mean “to roam the earth (or the land) intending to wreak\ncorruption” or “to strive to wreak corruption” (KK 43; see also CDKA 134). Formulations\nderived from other verbal roots that are semantically close to afsada fī l-a rḍ are ʿalā fī\nl-a rḍ, “to rise high in the land / on earth” (Q 10:83, 17:4, 28:4.83),3 and istakbara fī l-a rḍ,\n“to behave haughtily in the land / on earth” (Q 28:39, 29:39, 35:43, 41:15, 46:20; 7:13.146\nhave takabbara).\nThe spectrum of h uman corruptive behaviour. “To wreak corruption on earth” des-\nignates what one scholar has aptly described as “expressions of fundamental hostility to\nand subversion of God’s created order” (Denny 2001, 440). That “wreaking corruption”\nis to stand an existing order on its head emerges with par tic u lar clarity from Q 27:34,\nwhere the queen of Sabaʾ states, “When kings enter a town, they inflict corruption on it\n(afsadūhā) and h umble its mighty (wa- jaʿalū aʿizzata ahlihā adhillatan).” Such an inversion\nof order could in princip le play out on a truly cosmic scale: according to counterfactual\nstatements in Q 21:22 and 23:71, if the theological views of the Qur’an’s adversaries were\ntrue— specifically, if there were more than one God, as per Q 21:22— then heaven and\nearth would be doomed to corruption (verb: fasada).4 It is thus the dominion of the one\nGod, who has “put the earth in good order” (Q 7:56.85), that ensures a continued orderly\nfunctioning of the cosmos. This also emerges from Q 2:251, which concludes the story of\nDavid’s victory over Goliath by saying, “ Were it not for God’s repelling of some people by\nmeans of o thers, the earth would go to ruin (la-f asadati l-a rḍu)”: h uman aggression, u nless\nchecked by divine counter- measures, might easily overwhelm the world.\nThe statement just cited indicates very clearly where the Qur’an locates the source of\ncorruptive assaults on the divinely instituted cosmic order: in humankind. According to\nQ 30:41, corruption (al- fasād) can appear not only ashore but also at sea (fī l- barri wa- l-\nbaḥri), “on account of the doings of people’s hands” (bi- mā kasabat aydī l- nāsi): wherever\nhumans act, corruption may rear its head. That the potential for causing corruption is a\nconcomitant of h umans is explic itly raised in Q 2:30, in the context of the angels’ objection\nto God’s declared intention to appoint Adam, or humankind in general, as a → khalīfah or\n“deputy” on earth. It is true that the angels are subsequently put in their place when God\nchallenges them to inform him of the names of the things that he has created, a challenge\nthat the angels are unable to meet (Q 2:31–33). Nonetheless, this does not entail that the\nangels’ initial assessment of humankind’s corruptive potential is mistaken. Rather, when\nthe angels subsequently acknowledge the limits of their knowledge (Q 2:32) and God\nreiterates the same message (Q 2:33), the Qur’an would seem to be alluding to the fact\nthat God’s creation of a being so manifestly capable of causing corruption has a hidden\npurpose, which is elsewhere identified as God’s plan to subject h umans to moral scrutiny\n(see under → balā and below).\n3 The synonymity between ʿalā fī l- arḍ and afsada fī l- arḍ is clear from Q 28:83 (and prob ably also 17:4).\n4 Q 23:91 and 17:42 contain alternative expressions of the same basic argument: a plurality of deities could\nnot preside over an ordered and harmonious cosmos.

For\ninstance, Q 7:85, 11:85, and 26:182–183 associate the causing of corruption with fraudulent\nweighing; Q 12:73 links it with theft; Q 47:22 pairs it with “breaking the ties of kinship”;\nQ 2:30 conjoins it with the shedding of blood; and Q 5:32 signals that wreaking corruption\nmay constitute a valid excuse for killing the culprit. Wreaking corruption on earth can\nfurthermore have an explic itly religious dimension, in so far as it is employed as the op-\nposite of invoking God (Q 7:56) or of serving God and expecting the “last day” (Q 29:36).\nWreaking corruption is also placed alongside breaking God’s covenant and disobeying him\n(Q 2:27, 13:25) and tied to unbelief and turning people away from God’s path (Q 16:88).\nWhen Q 5:33 casts the act of waging of war against “God and his Messenger” as an instance\nof wreaking corruption, deserving punishment by crucifixion, maiming, or exile, this is\nclearly predicated on equating re sis tance to the Messenger with re sis tance to God. The\nreligious aspect of wreaking corruption is even invoked by the Qur’anic Phar aoh, who in\nQ 40:26 seems to equate it with a change of his p eople’s established religion: “I fear that\nhe,” namely, Moses, “ will change your religion (dīn) or cause corruption to appear on earth /\nin the land (aw an yuẓhira fī l- arḍi l- fasād).” Similarly, in Q 7:127 the Egyptian notables\naddress Pha raoh by voicing the fear that Moses and his people “ will wreak corruption on\nearth / in the land” and that he “ will forsake you and your gods.” Wreaking corruption is\nhere conceived as defiance of a theologico-p olitical complex of authority encompassing\nboth Egypt’s ruler and its established cult.\nFi nally, while the moral and religious aspects of wreaking corruption are generally\npredominant, wreaking corruption can also apparently involve physical devastation, in\nso far as Q 2:205 links it to the destruction of crops (al-ḥ arth) and “ofspring” (al- nasl),\nwhich could h ere mean specifically animal “ofspring” or livestock. It is not surprising that\nthe Qur’an, by virtue of being a late antique document, nowhere anticipates the potential\nof modern scientific technology to devastate and annihilate the very ecosphere on which\nhuman survival depends. Nonetheless, the Qur’anic motif that h umans are prone to corrupt\nand pervert a world that the creator has put in good order (Q 7:56.85) ofers an obvious\nscriptural springboard for an ethics of responsible ecological stewardship of the earth. At\nthe very least, the idea is apt to counterbalance Qur’anic affirmations that God has made\nthe world or specific entities within it subservient or subject (sakhkhara, dhallala, jaʿala\ndhalūlan) to h umans (e.g., Q 67:15; see in more detail u nder → arḍ), statements that might\nother wise imply that h umans are f ree to exploit and manipulate the ecosphere in what ever\nway they deem fit.\nGods, h umans, and the earth. The prepositional phrase “on the earth” or “in the land”\n(fī l- arḍ) also occurs with a number of other verbs, such as → makkana + acc. fī l- arḍ, “to\nestablish s.o. on the earth / in the land,” bawwaʾa + acc. fī l- arḍ, “to give s.o. an abode on\nthe earth / in the land” (CDKA 45), and → istakhlafa + acc. fī l- arḍ / jaʿala + acc. khalāʾifa fī\nl- arḍ, “to appoint a certain group deputies over the earth/land.” Underpinning this termi-\nnological nexus is a general conception of the relationship between God, humans, and the\nearth. God settles humans on the earth as a perfectly hospitable abode (→ arḍ). As already\nintimated e arlier, God’s ultimate purpose in d oing so is to “test youp with regard to what he\nhas given you” (Q 6:165: li- yabluwakum fī mā ātākum; see also 11:7 and → balā), namely,\nto ascertain whether the human beneficiaries of his blessings w ill act in keeping with the\nreligious and moral obligations that are taken to follow from receiving generous usufruct\nof God’s earth.

Thus, in Q 11:84–85 the messenger Shuʿayb calls upon the\npeople of Madyan to serve the one God, to shun fraudulent mea sur ing and weighing, and\nto avoid “causing mischief and corruption on earth” (v. 85: wa- lā taʿthaw fī l- arḍi mufsidīn;\nsee also 7:85). A similar plea is conveyed by Ṣāliḥ to the p eople of Thamūd (Q 7:74): “Re-\nmemberp how God appointed you as deputies (jaʿalakum khulafāʾa) after ʿĀd and gave\nyou an abode in the land (bawwaʾakum fī l- arḍi), such that you established fortresses in its\nplains and hewed mountains into houses. Remember God’s wondrous deeds (ālāʾ),5 and\ndo not cause mischief and corruption on earth (wa- lā taʿthaw fī l- arḍi mufsidīn).” Yet like\nother communities, both the people of Madyan and Thamūd failed to heed these warnings\nand were consequently obliterated and replaced by a dif er ent population, whom God\nmade “deputies over the earth/land” in their stead (see under → istakhlafa). The Qur’an\naccordingly envisages a reactive historical cycle in which God’s munificent bestowal upon\nhumans of an earthly abode is potentially followed by the h uman wreaking of corruption\nin their divinely gifted habitat, to which God in turn responds by replacing the culprits by\nother “deputies.” He w ill then observe how t hese successors w ill act in their turn (Q 7:129\nand 10:14: li- yanẓura/li- nanẓura kayfa taʿmalūn).\nBiblical assonances. The notion of causing corruption on the earth in Q 2:30 in par-\ntic u lar, where it forms part of the angels’ protest against God’s plan to create man—“ Will\nyou establish on it [namely, on the earth] someone who w ill wreak corruption t here and\nshed blood?”— has been connected to Gen 6:11–13 (Reeves 2003, 54; QP 198–200). Ac-\ncording to the Biblical passage, at the time of Noah “the earth was corrupt (wattiššāḥēt,\nPeshitta: etḥabblet) before God” and was “filled with vio lence.” As Reeves notes, the Bible’s\nunspecific reference to vio lence here is concretised to illicit bloodshed in 1 Enoch and\nJubilees (see 1 Enoch 9:1.9 = Charlesworth 1983, 16–17, and Jubilees = VanderKam 1989, ch.\n7:23–25), thus paralleling the angels’ second accusation against humans as reported in\nQ 2:30. The theme of the earth’s antediluvian corruption also figures prominently in the\nway in which Gen 6:11–13 is retold in Jubilees 5:2–3. Unlike the Bible, however, the Qur’an\ndoes not associate the corruption of the earth with one par tic u lar historical moment but\nrather pre sents it as a constant risk besetting h uman behaviour at any time. This is reflected\nby the fact that the wreaking of corruption on earth is a comparatively frequent Qur’anic\ntrope, thus contrasting with the singular character of the Biblical comparandum.\nAnother, and more frequent, Biblical theme that is potentially pertinent is the notion\nthat vari ous sexual transgressions, bloodshed, and idolatry defile the Promised Land and\ncause it to “spew out its inhabitants” (e.g., Lev 18:24–30, Num 35:33–34, and Ps 106:34–40;\nsee Klawans 2000, 26–33), an idea that the subsequent rabbinic tradition takes quite liter-\nally (Klawans 2000, 118–135).6 To be sure, there is no justification for narrowly equating\n5 On ālāʾ, see al-F arāhī 2002, 125–133 (who cites relevant poetic prooftexts). The meaning given is usually\n“blessings” (CDKA 27), but as al-F arāhī notes, this does not fit at Q 53:55 and also, arguably, for some of the term’s\nmany occurrences in Surah 55, where ālāʾ figures in the refrain. The word should prob ably be considered closer\nin meaning to → āyah, which can similarly encompass divine acts of punishment, than to niʿmah (on which see\nunder → anʿama).

Moreover, defilement is clearly not the same as corruption, meaning that\nin terms of phraseological similarity Gen 6:11–13 makes for a closer parallel. On the other\nhand, the hortatory impetus animating Biblical calls to avoid defilement of the land bears\na functional resemblance to the Qur’an’s strictures against wreaking corruption on earth\nor in the land. That the latter might involve at least a resonance of the Biblical theme of\ndefilement of the land is supported by the fact that both are linked with bloodshed (Q 2:30)\nand failure to serve God (e.g., Q 29:36).\nEspecially noteworthy in this regard is the Meccan passage Q 17:4–8, where causing\ncorruption is explic itly connected to the ancient Israelites: twice they were guilty of\nwreaking corruption on earth or in the land (Q 17:4), and in both cases they were pun-\nished by foreign conquest of their “dwellings” and sanctuary (Q 17:5.7), reference being\npresumably to the capture of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and the Romans.7 Similar to\nPentateuchal threats cautioning the Israelites against defiling the Promised Land, the more\nuniversal Qur’anic discourse about God’s “earth” or “land” rests on the assumption that God\nwill see to it that his “land” is populated by worthy occupants, if needs be by swapping an\nentire population against another. It is worth underlining that even in the Qur’an, neither of\nthe Israelites’ two episodes of wreaking of corruption as sketched in Q 17:4–8 leads to their\neradication. As has been previously observed (Ghafar 2020, 18), this forms an arresting\ncontrast with other sinful collectives in Qur’anic punishment legends, such as the p eople of\nNoah, ʿĀd, the p eople of Lot, and Thamūd (e.g., Q 7:59–93).

Faṣṣala often takes as its grammatical object God’s “signs” (→ āyāt;\ne.g., Q 6:55.97.98.126, 7:32.174, 9:11, 10:5.24, 13:2). In t hese verses, the agent of expounding\nis always the Qur’an’s divine speaker, who sets out his signs for the benefit (li-) of a h uman\naudience so that the latter might “know” and “understand” the theological significance\nof these signs. The assumption that faṣṣala is to make something understood also yields a\nfeasible, though perhaps not the only pos sib le, construal of Q 41:44: “Had we made it a\nnon-A rabic recitation, they would have said, ‘Why have its signs not been clearly set out?’ ”\n(wa-l aw jaʿalnāhu qurʾānan aʿjamiyyan la-q ālū law-l ā fuṣṣilat āyātuhu).1 In some cases, the\nobject of God’s expounding (tafṣīl) is “every thing” (kull shayʾ; Q 6:154, 7:145, 12:111, 17:12),\nwhich should prob ably be taken to mean that God extracts from the sum total of things that\nexist the theological gist that is relevant for h umans to internalise.2 At Q 6:119, it is divine\nprohibitions that form the object of faṣṣala: God “has expounded to youp in detail (faṣṣala\nlakum) what he has forbidden to you, except for t hings to [the consumption of] which\nyou are compelled.” This is a retrospective allusion to the Qur’an’s dietary taboos (carrion,\nblood, pork, and food over which another deity than God has been invoked), which are\ncata logued in four other verses, Q 2:173, 6:145, 16:115, and 5:3 (Sinai 2019c).\nThe verb faṣṣala is, furthermore, associated with the archetypal celestial “scripture”\n(→ kitāb) from which the Qur’anic proclamations claim to derive and which is in some\nsense understood to contain the manifold signs rehearsed by the Qur’an. Thus, in Q 11:1,\nit is the “signs” of “the scripture” that are expounded by God (kitābun uḥkimat āyātuhu\nthumma fuṣṣilat min ladun ḥakīmin khabīr), while Q 41:3 affirms that the “signs” of the\n“scripture” have been “expounded as an Arabic recitation so that people might know”\n(kitābun fuṣṣilat āyātuhu qurʾānan ʿarabiyyan li-q awmin yaʿlamūn).3 Q 10:37 similarly calls\n“this recitation” (hādhā al- qurʾān) an “expounding of the scripture” (tafṣīl al- kitāb). Thus, it\nis via an act of divine exposition or tafṣīl that the celestial scripture, which as such is beyond\nhuman reach, is transformed into revelatory proclamations in Arabic that are intelligible\nto a par tic ul ar audience. In Q 7:52, the divine speaker avers that “we brought them a scrip-\nture that we knowledgeably expounded in detail, as guidance and mercy so that p eople\nmight believe” (wa- la- qad jiʾnāhum bi- kitābin faṣṣalnāhu ʿalā ʿilmin hudan wa- raḥmatan\nli- qawmin yuʾminūn).4 H ere, the scripture at hand is most likely not the celestial archetype\n1 On aʿjamī, “non- Arabic,” see under → ʿarabī.\n2 Note that in Q 6:154 and 12:111, tafṣīlan li- kulli shayʾin / tafṣīla kulli shayʾin (“as an expounding of every-\nthing”) as an adverbial accusative clarifying the purpose of divine revelation is followed by wa- hudan wa-\nraḥmatan (“and as guidance and mercy”). This suggests that God’s objective is not to bestow a universal register\nof sorts but rather to guide his addressees on the path to salvation. Similarly, Q 7:145 says that the tablets given\nto Moses contained “an admonition about every thing and an expounding of every thing” (wa- katabnā lahu fī\nl- alwāḥi min kulli shayʾin mawʿiẓatan wa- tafṣīlan li- kulli shayʾin).\n3 The liberal rendering of li- qawmin yaʿlamūn (literally, “for people who know”) is justified below.\n4 On the use of “so that” in this translation, see again below.\n558 faṣṣala", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Nonetheless,\nit remains true that the verb faṣṣala generally designates the pro cess of elucidatory conver-\nsion by which the celestial scripture is mediated and rendered accessible to h umans—in a\nshape and form that may be assumed to be intimately geared to the intended audience, in\nso far as it re spects their cultural and linguistic requirements. This pro cess of conversion\nis comparable to God undertaking to deliver a revelatory “targum,” or interpretive trans-\nlation, of the celestial scripture (Sinai 2006, 120–126).5\nThe precise purport of faṣṣala is sufficiently enigmatic in order to have generated alter-\nnative interpretations. For example, Jan Retsö proposes that faṣṣala is to render a discourse\nin rhymed prose (Retsö 2003, 44–45). However, apart from the fact that the post- Qur’anic\ntradition uses the noun fāṣilah to designate the rhyme-w ord of a Qur’anic verse or of a unit\nof rhymed prose in general (AEL 2407; Stewart 2013, 28, 31, 32, 36), there is little justifica-\ntion for attributing such a specific sense to faṣṣala, or even for the under lying assumption\nthat faṣṣala primarily designates literary form rather than the intelligible conveyance of\ncontent. Yet another understanding of faṣṣala is advocated by Walid Saleh. He maintains\nthat faṣṣala is largely synonymous with the first-f orm verb faraqa, “to divide up,” which\nQ 17:106 employs in order to express the “piecemeal” nature of the Qur’anic revelations\n(Saleh 2015, 43–50; see also Loynes 2021, 49–50, and u nder → furqān). This understanding\nof faṣṣala is problematic at least for Q 6:119. As noted above, the verse is a retrospective\nallusion to earlier verses setting out the Qur’an’s dietary taboos. Yet all four passages that\nQ 6:119 might feasibly be referring back to give a full run- down of t hese food taboos rather\nthan presenting them in an accumulating series of successive instalments. Hence, Saleh’s\nproposed equation of faṣṣala with faraqa does not fit Q 6:119. Also worth a closer look is\nQ 7:133, which Saleh argues utilises the participle mufaṣṣal in order to highlight “the serial\noccurrence of the ten plagues of the Egyptians” (Saleh 2015, 46). But when Q 7:133 states\nthat God sent down vario us calamities “as āyāt mufaṣṣalāt,” this could equally respond to\nthe Egyptians’ assertion in the previous verse (Q 7:132) that they will not believe Moses\nwhat ever “sign” he might produce (mahmā taʾtinā bihi min āyatin). The point made in\nQ 7:133 may accordingly be that the natur al disasters that subsequently befell the Egyptians\nconstituted “signs clearly expounded” in the sense of supplying what the Egyptians ought\nto have accepted as conclusive proof that Moses was indeed God’s messenger (cf. Moses’s\nself- description in Q 7:104). Such a reading entails that the question w hether Moses de-\nlivered his signs serially or wholesale is not the issue here.\nFaṣṣala followed by li-q awmin + verb in the prefix conjugation (e.g., li-q awmin\nyaʿlamūn). As illustrated by some of the examples quoted earlier, faṣṣala is often fol-\nlowed by a prepositional syntagm introduced by li-q awmin, such as “for people who\nknow” (Q 6:97, 7:32, 9:11, 10:5, 41:3: li- qawmin yaʿlamūn), “for people who understand”\n5 The preceding interpretation might also be compared with a passage in Jacob of Sarug’s homily on creation,\nwhich discusses at length how God “divided up” (pallget) his revelations regarding the mysteries of creation in\naccordance with the prophetic gift accorded to dif er ent individuals, such as Moses, David, Isaiah, or Ezekiel. As\na consequence, these prophets gave dif er ent yet ultimately complementary accounts of God’s creation of the\nworld and the beings in it (Mathews 2009, 36–47, ll. 255–362). Thus, Moses limited itself to an explicit account\nof God’s corporeal creation, leaving the creation of the angels to l ater prophets. It is at least intimated that the\nreason for such selectiveness has to do with the needs of the respective addressees: when Moses recorded the\nevents of creation, “ every creature was being worshipped by mankind” and people did not know that they had\na creator at all (Mathews 2009, 46–47, ll. 349–352).\nfaṣṣala 559", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Also\nrelatively frequent (nineteen occurrences) are statements of the form “In X there are signs\n(āyāt) li- qawmin . . .” (e.g., Q 2:164, 6:99, 10:6.67, 30:21.23.24.37, 45:3–5).\nOne might understand such li-q awmin supplements to reveal that the recipients ad-\ndressed by God’s signs are only those humans who already recognise, or are disposed to\nrecognise, certain cosmic or natu ral phenomena as pointing to God’s presence, omnip-\notence, and ability to inflict retribution. Such a reading invariably engenders the ques-\ntion whether it makes much sense to posit that human understanding, knowledge, and\nheedfulness precede God’s expounding of his signs, as opposed to being engendered by\nit. One might respond by saying that perhaps the signs in questions are only addressed\nto those humans whom God has predestined to believe in them. However, other verses\ncombine a main clause referring to the display or expounding of God’s signs with a con-\nsecutive clause introduced by → laʿalla, “so that,” such as Q 2:73, 2:178, and 13:2: God\n“shows youp his signs so that you might understand (laʿallakum taʿqilūn)”; God “clarifies\nhis signs to the people so that they might be God- fearing (laʿallahum yattaqūn); and God\n“expounds the signs so that you might have certainty about meeting your Lord.” In all of\nthese statements, we encounter the expected sequence that communication of God’s signs\nis meant to prompt human insight rather than presupposing it, and it is quite clear that\nGod’s signs are directed at “the people” (al-n ās) at large (Q 2:187; similarly 2:221) rather\nthan at the small subset of people who are already converted.6 It is therefore attractive\nto conjecture, with Daniel Madigan, that li-q awmin syntagms are to be understood as\nequivalent to such laʿalla clauses (Madigan 2001, 100–101) and to construe phrases like\nli-q awmin yaʿlamūn as having the approximate sense of “so that people might come to\nknow” rather than “for people who [already] have knowledge.”\nNaturally, li- qawmin yaʿlamūn does not literally mean “so that p eople might know.” But\nit merits noting that all Qur’anic instances of li- qawmin + verb in the prefix conjugation\noccur in verse- final position. Given that it has been shown that the Qur’an often accom-\nmodates a passage’s prevailing rhyme by miscellaneous devices, such as modifying the\nexpected word order or replacing an expected expression by a cognate substitute (Stewart\n2009), the conjecture that li- qawmin yaʿlamūn is functionally equivalent to a non- rhyming\nvariant like li- yaʿlama qawmun or li- yaʿlama l- nāsu coheres well with a more general feature\nof Qur’anic style. In any case, the philological liberty of rendering an asyndetic relative\nclause by a consecutive clause is mitigated if one opts for translations like “for people who\nwould have knowledge,” “for p eople who would have understanding,” e tc., which make it\nclear that knowledge and understanding are an intended result rather than a precondition\nof being exposed to God’s signs.\n6 For more detail on al- nās, see under → al-ʿ ālamūn.\n560 faṣṣala", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Verse-i nternal affirmations of divine power show a\npreference for the active participle qādir (Q 6:37.65, 17:99, 36:81, 46:33, 75:40; see also\n75:4 with the plural), and even some verse- final statements have qādir or its plural qādirūn\nwhere this is in keeping with the surrounding rhyme pattern (Q 23:18.95, 70:40, 86:8).\nConversely, the only verse- internal occurrences of qadīr are in Q 60:7 and 65:12, both of\nwhich are late and likely to reflect the set phrase ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr. Use of the faʿīl\nform qadīr in the sense of the cognate fāʿil form is therefore to be regarded as motivated\nby rhyme (see generally Müller 1969 and Stewart 2009, 20–25).1 This conclusion is further\nsupported by the analogous cases of Q 95:3 and 44:51, where verse-fi nal amīn occurs in\nlieu of the active participle āmin, also due to rhyme (Müller 1969, 54–59).\nGod’s supremacy over all things. The phrase ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr recalls the Greek\nepithet pantokratōr, which is conventionally rendered “almighty” but perhaps more ac-\ncurately translated “ruler of all things” (see TDNT 3:914–915).2 Should we, then, take the\nQur’anic predication ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr to assert God’s “supremacy over all things,” as\none scholar has explained the purport of Greek pantokratōr (TDNT 3:915)? Qadara ʿalā (or\nbeing qādir ʿalā) can mean having power over someone or something (e.g., Q 5:34, 10:24,\n16:75, 21:87, 57:29, 90:5), but qadara ʿalā—in the construction qādir ʿalā an + subordinate\nclause— can also refer to someone’s ability to do something, i.e., to execute a certain action\n(e.g., Q 6:37: inna llāha qādirun ʿalā an yunazzila āyatan, “God is able to send down a sign”;\nsee also 6:65, 17:99, 36:81, 46:33, 75:4.40). Against this background, ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr\ncould be taken to mean, not divine supremacy over all things, but rather God’s ability to\ndo anything (or anything that is not logically impossible), as explic itly stated in Q 2:253,\n11:107, 22:14, 85:16: God “does what he wants” (yafʿalu mā yurīd or faʿʿālun li- mā yurīd; see\nunder → shāʾa). This way of parsing ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr is implied, for instance, when the\nTafsīr al- Jalālayn glosses ʿalā kulli shayʾin (“over every thing”) in Q 2:20 as ʿalā kulli shayʾin\nshāʾahu (“over every thing he wills”; see Jal. 10), perhaps based on the occurrence of the\nsame verb → shāʾa earlier in the same verse (wa- law shāˈa llāhu la- dhahaba bi- samʿihim\nwa- abṣārihim, “If God willed, he would take away their hearing and their sight”). Accord-\ning to this reading, the universal quantifier “every thing” in ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr would\nrange over conceivable divine actions rather than over the entities populating the world.\nYet a number of observations instead support what one might call the cosmic suprem-\nacy interpretation of Qur’anic ʿalā kulli shayʾin qadīr affirmations, according to which it\nattributes to God supremacy over all things. Most importantly, the meaning of kull shayʾ\nin other contexts is consistently amenable to being elucidated as “every thing that exists.”\nThus, when it is repeatedly declared that God is bi-k ulli shayʾin ʿalīm, “knowledgeable\nabout all things” (e.g., Q 2:29.231.282, 4:32.176), this must mean that God is comprehen-\nsively knowledgeable about the entities existing in the world, including their states and\nthe events involving them, and not that God has full knowledge of all the t hings he might\npossibly want to do or to create. The same applies when God is described as “the creator of\nall things” (khāliqu kulli shayʾin, Q 6:102, 13:16, 39:62, 40:62; see also 6:101, 25:2: khalaqa\n1 Cf. also the variant ʿalā kulli shayʿin muqtadirā in Q 18:45, in line with the rhyme.\n2 Being common in the Septuagint, pantokratōr is also employed in 2 Cor 6:18 and, mostly in the form kyrios\nho theos ho pantokratōr (“the Lord God, ruler of all things”), several times throughout the book of Revelation\n(Rev 1:8, 4:8, 11:17, 15:3, 16:7.14, 19:6.15, 21:22). The Peshitta almost always renders pantokratōr by aḥīd koll, an\nexpression that continues to resonate in later Christian texts (e.g., Vööbus 1979, 9, l. 2, 11, l. 12, and 63, l. 12).\n564 qadīr", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The\nremaining occurrences of q- d- s will be briefly surveyed in what follows.\nMuqaddas and quddūs. Confirming the preceding observations, the passive parti-\nciple muqaddas (“holy” or perhaps “worthy of being declared to be holy”) is exclusively\nused in connection with Biblical places and narratives. Thus, in Q 20:12 and 79:16, the\nattribute muqaddas qualifies the “valley of Ṭuwā,” where the Qur’an locates Moses’s\nvision of the burning bush and his prophetic initiation (cf. Exod 3:1–4:17; on the term\nṭuwā, which may not be a proper name, see Rubin 2014b, 75–81). The Qur’anic charac-\nterisation of the site of the burning bush as being “holy,” muqaddas, may reflect the fact\nthat Exod 3:5 explic itly describes Moses as standing on “holy ground” (JPND 218; Rubin\n2014b, 73 and 75). The third and final Qur’anic occurrence of muqaddas comes in Q 5:21,\nwhere Moses encourages the Israelites to enter “the holy land” (al-a rḍ al-m uqaddasah),\nthe equivalent of the Biblical Canaan.2 As Rubin notes (Rubin 2014b, 74), an alterna-\ntive designation for the Holy Land is “the land that we”— namely, God— “have blessed”\n(Q 21:71.81: al-a rḍ allatī bāraknā fīhā; see similarly 7:137 and cf. 17:1, 34:18), and the site of\nMoses’s commission is similarly said to have been “blessed,” mubārak (Q 28:30; cf. 27:8).3\nConsequently, the holiness of both places would seem to be grounded in a special link\nwith God, the fount of all holiness.\nFittingly, the Qur’an expresses the inherent and non- derivative holiness of God himself\nnot by the passive participle muqaddas but by the epithet quddūs, employed in Q 59:23 and\n62:1 as part of the divine title al- malik al- quddūs, “holy king” (see Rubin 2014b, 75; → ism).\nAl- malik al- quddūs corresponds to Hebrew ha- melek ha- qadosh, an epithet that according\nto the Babylonian Talmud features in the Jewish ʿamidah prayer during the ten days before\nthe Day of Atonement (b. Bәr. 12b) and may echo Ps 89:19 (BEḲ 40 and JPND 219). One\nmay add the etymological note that the specific form quddūs derives from Classical Ethi-\nopic qәddus rather than directly from Hebrew qādôš (JPND 219). Application of Ethiopic\nqәddus is not confined to the deity (see Leslau 1991, 423). In view of this, one might envisage\na scenario whereby Ethiopic qәddus (conceivably mediated via Sabaic) gave rise to the\nArabic word quddūs as an epithet reserved for God. The Arabic divine epithet quddūs may\nthen have spread to Arabophone Jews, who employed it in Arabising Hebrew ha- melek\nha- qadosh as al- malik al- quddūs.\nThe verb qaddasa. The last occurrence of q- d- s to be reviewed is Q 2:30, where the an-\ngels profess to be engaged in declaring God’s holiness (nuqaddisu laka; see u nder → malak).\nThis, too, is likely to have a Biblical background, namely, the angels’ exclamation in Isa\n6:3, “Holy (qādôš), holy, holy is the Lord of hosts” (see also Rev 4:8), an exclamation that\nfigures both in the Jewish qәdushah prayer (Elbogen 1931, 61–67; see JPND 219) and in the\nChristian Sanctus hymn. In fact, Syriac qaddesh can have the specific meaning “to recite the\nSanctus” (SL 1320). Interestingly, one of the prooftexts that is cited in SL, found in a hymn\nby Jacob of Sarug (Bedjan 1905–1910, 3:5, l. 13; see the translation in Mathews 2009, 16–17,\n2 The fact that both the site of the burning bush and the land promised to the Israelites are characterised by\nthe same attribute muqaddas is significant. It implies either that the Qur’an considers Mount Sinai—in whose\nvicinity both the Qur’an and the Bible place the burning bush—to be situated in the land of the Israelites (Sinai\n2017b, 207–208) or at least that the Qur’an considers Mount Sinai and the land of the Israelites to share the same\nkind and degree of holiness (Rubin 2014b, 74–75).\n3 The verb bāraka is now, it seems, attested in a Palaeo- Arabic inscription from north of al- Ṭāʾif (Al- Jallad\nand Sidky 2021).\n566 qaddasa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is not an isolated case in\nSyriac (see also Mathews 2009, 30–31, ll. 190–192, and 34–35, l. 229).4\nConcluding remarks on q- d- s and ḥ- r- m. In sum, as previously stressed by Mark Durie,\nall occurrences of the root q- d- s in the Qur’an display an obvious connection with Biblical\nhistory and geography or can be meaningfully linked to a Biblical intertext (Durie 2018,\n180). In contrast to the root ḥ-r -m , which expresses sacrality in the Durkheimian sense\nof inviolability, of things “set apart” and “forbidden” by virtue of being subject to special\ntaboos and restrictions (→ ḥarrama), the root q- d- s conveys the numinous, awe- inspiring\nnature of the deity himself (see generally Otto 2014) and the special quality of the Biblical\nHoly Land, presumably by virtue of being a region particularly associated with salvific\ndivine manifestations and interventions in history.5 While the Arabic root q- d- s was almost\ncertainly borrowed from Jewish and/or Christian usage (FVQ 232), this would seem to\nhave occurred well before the Qur’an, since a poem attributed to Imruʾ al- Qays compares\nhunting dogs sinking their teeth into the legs of a wild ox to children tearing at the robe of\na muqaddis, perhaps a Christian monk or priest celebrating mass (DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays,\nno. 31:12; JPND 218).6\nqaddama intr./tr. li- | to make preparations for s.th., to prepare s.th. for s.th.\nqaddama tr.

The Qur’an frequently employs the second-f orm verb qad-\ndama with the plural aydin or the dual yadān (“hands”), followed by a possessive suffix,\nas its grammatical subject (e.g., Q 2:95: mā qaddamat aydīhim and 78:40: mā qaddamat\nyadāhu; see also 3:182, 4:62, 8:51, 18:57, 22:10, 28:47, 30:36, 42:48, and 62:7). On occasion,\nqaddama combines with a prepositional phrase introduced by li- , such as li- anfusikum,\n“for yourselves” or “on behalf of yourselves” (Q 2:110.223, 73:20). In three cases, anfus or\nits singular → nafs (“self,” but also “soul”) figure as the grammatical subject of qaddama\n(e.g., Q 5:80: mā qaddamat lahum anfusuhum; see also 59:18 and 82:5). Q 12:48, according\nto which Joseph tells the Egyptians that they will face “seven hard [years] that will eat\nwhat you have prepared for them (mā qaddamtum lahunna),” shows that qaddama li- can\ndesignate the making of provisions for some future eventuality (see also CDKA 221). Most\n4 On qaddasa in Q 2:30, see also Zellentin 2017, 85–86 and 125.\n5 Durie links the root q- d- s with “the idea of separation” (Durie 2018, 181). While agreeing with his general\ninsistence on the diference between two conceptions of holiness in the Qur’an, a native Arabian one corre-\nsponding to ḥ- r- m and a Biblical one corresponding to q- d- s, I am very doubtful that it is accurate to identify the\nQur’anic valence of q- d- s with the notion of separation. Note that the only piece of evidence that Durie adduces\nin this regard is AEL 2496, according to which qadasa means “to go far away” (Durie 2018, 245, n. 44). But this\nis not of course a Qur’anic piece of lexical information.\n6 See also Fraenkel 1886, 270, arguing against the traditional identification of the muqaddis as a pilgrim\nentering Jerusalem.\nqaddama 567", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For example, the Israelites are accused\nof being afraid of dying “on account of what their hands qaddamat” (bi-m ā qaddamat\naydīhim; Q 2:95), and the believers are urged, “qaddimū for yourselves and fear God”\n(qaddimū li- anfusikum wa- ttaqū llāha; 2:223).\nQaddama in early poetry. As shown by Bravmann, the verb qaddama is also found\nin early Arabic poetry (Bravmann 1972, 95–104). For instance, a poem from the dīwān of\nṬufayl ibn ʿAwf has the phrase mā qaddamat lahu yadāhu (Krenkow 1927, Ṭufayl, no. 19:1,\ndiscussed in Bravmann 1972, 95–96); just as in some of the Qur’anic verse surveyed above,\nthe grammatical subject of the verb qaddama is “his hands” here. Bravmann argues that\nthe phrase is best rendered “what his hands have accomplished for him” or “on his behalf,”\nexpressing the heroic notion that “a man’s deed becomes part of his permanent rec ord and\nhis warlike ‘past’ ” (Bravmann 1972, 98). Also pertinent is a line from the dīwān of ʿAlqamah\nalluding to “the evil” that the members of a certain group have perpetrated or brought\nupon themselves (mā qaddamū li- nufūsihim mina l- sharri; DSAAP, ʿAlqamah, no. 10:6,\ndiscussed in Bravmann 1972, 96). Similar to Q 2:110.223 and 73:20, the verb qaddama here\ncombines with the preposition li- followed by the plural of nafs. Moreover, as Bravmann\nhighlights, the ʿAlqamah verse shows particularly clearly that qaddama can refer not only\nto the doing of virtuous or reputable deeds but also to committing ignominious ones. In\nfact, ʿAlqamah’s mā qaddamū li- nufūsihim mina l-s harri forms a strikingly neat counterpart\nto mā tuqaddimū li- anfusikum min khayrin in Q 2:110 and 73:20.\nQaddama = “to accomplish previously”? Qur’anic qaddama is often understood in\na literal sense as designating the “forwarding” of one’s deserts or transgressions to one’s\nfinal judgement. Thus, al- Ṭabarī glosses Q 2:110 (mā tuqaddimū li- anfusikum min khayrin\ntajidūhu ʿinda allāhi) as meaning, “What ever righ teous deeds you do in the days of your\nlife, such that you are sending them forward prior to your death as a supply for yourselves\nin the hereafter, you w ill find its reward with your Lord on the day of resurrection” (Ṭab.\n2:426; see also Mir 1989, 268, as well as the Arberry 1955 and Jones 2007, both opting for “to\nforward” or “to send forward”). In favour of qaddama meaning “to send s.th. ahead,” one\nmay point to Q 50:28 (wa- qad qaddamtu ilaykum bi- l- waʿīd, “I have previously conveyed\nmy threatening pledge to you”; see CDKA 221). On the other hand, Bravmann’s discussion\nof the semantics of qaddama makes it attractive to consider rendering qaddama as “to\naccomplish” (Bravmann 1972, 96), in the interest of bringing out the semantic continuity\nbetween Qur’anic qaddama and its poetic usage, which certainly does not imply an escha-\ntological reckoning to which one’s deeds are literally “forwarded.” In light of Q 10:30 and\n69:24, which employ aslafa + acc., “to do s.th. beforehand,” in an eschatological context\nin which one might other wise have expected qaddama, one might revise Bravmann’s\nproposed translation into “to accomplish s.th. previously.”\nStill, such a Bravmann- inspired approach cannot be implemented across the board with-\nout some contextual variation and modification. For instance, in Q 12:48 (quoted above)\nqaddama can hardly be rendered other than by “to prepare,” “to make advance provisions,”\nor the like. Another verse for which the general translational policy of rendering qaddama\nas “to accomplish” requires variation is Q 59:18, where wa- l- tanẓur nafsun mā qaddamat li-\nghadin might be rendered as “Let every one behold what he has accomplished in preparation\nfor tomorrow.” For Q 2:223 (qaddimū li- anfusikum wa- ttaqū llāha) one may suggest “store up\naccomplishments for yourselves and fear God.” Moreover, the En glish verb “to accomplish”\n568 qaddama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, while mā tuqad-\ndimū li-a nfusikum min khayrin in Q 2:110 and 73:20 is acceptably rendered “what ever good\nyou accomplish on your own behalf,” ʿAlqamah’s mā qaddamū li- nufūsihim mina l-s harri\nnecessitates recourse to a dif ere nt En glish verb (e.g., “the evil that they have committed”\nor even “by which they have tarnished themselves”). Fin ally, two verses juxtapose qaddama\nand akhkhara (Q 75:13, 82:5). Although akhkhara can clearly mean “to postpone,” “to delay”\n(e.g., Q 71:4; see CDKA 22 and u nder → ajal), the rhetorically efective antithesis between\nq- d- m and ʾ- kh- r in Q 75:13 and 82:5 is perhaps best approximated by rendering Q 82:5 as\n“every one w ill come to know what he/she has accomplished and neglected to accomplish”\n(ʿalimat nafsun mā qaddamat wa- akhkharat).1\nOf course, in contrast to pre- Islamic poetry, the actions whose accomplishment is\ninvoked in the Qur’an are not merely the constituent ele ments of a man’s track rec ord of\ndisplaying miscellaneous heroic virtues. Rather, they derive their ultimate significance from\nthe fact that they accord, or fail to accord, with the moral norms enforced by a divine judge\nwho will mete out eternal posthumous rewards and punishments. From this vantage point,\na human’s deeds do not only add to his or her individual rec ord of achievements but will\nalso determine his/her chances of withstanding divine muster “on the day on which man\nwill behold what his hands have accomplished” (yawma yanẓuru l- marʾu mā qaddamat\nyadāhu; Q 78:40). Similarly, Q 2:110 and 73:20 aver that “what ever good you accomplish for\nyourselves you w ill find with God” (wa- mā tuqaddimū li- anfusikum min- khayrin tajidūhu\nʿinda llāhi). In this sense, the Qur’an clearly invites associating the verb qaddama with\nproviding for one’s afterlife (cf. Q 89:24: yā- laytanī qaddamtu li-ḥ ayātī, “Would that I had\nmade preparations for my life [ after death]”), just as the Egyptians in Q 12:48 “provide for”\nseven lean years. But even if the eschatological perspective with which Qur’anic qaddama\nis bound up is absent from pre- Islamic poetry, “both usages can be considered as having\none ele ment of meaning in common which is not specifically religious: the idea that good\nand noble, as well as bad and ignominious achievements are indestructible, in other words,\nthat their existence is not over with their actuality, and that they can be accumulated, like\na capital” (Bravmann 1972, 100).\nAs pointed out by Ahrens (CQ 49), a passage from the Syriac Lives of the Eastern Saints\nby the sixth- century author John of Ephesus describes a rich w oman who decides to give\naway all of her possessions as “sending ahead every thing that you own” (mshaddrā att\nqdāmayk koll meddem d- īt lek; Land 1868, 270, ll. 2–3 = Brooks 1926, 195, l. 10). This could\nbe deemed to validate the conventional rendering of Qur’anic qaddama as “to send for-\nward, send ahead” or the like. However, the phraseological similarity of the Qur’anic usage\nwith the two poetic prooftexts cited earlier— namely, the strong tendency displayed by\nQur’anic qaddama to collocate with “hands” (aydin, yadān) as well as its combination\nwith li- + plural of nafs— supports a default recourse to the translation “to accomplish”\nwhere the context allows it, based on Bravmann’s analy sis of the use of qaddama in early\nArabic poetry. This does not, of course, mean that the Qur’an is residually committed to\nthe heroism of pre- Islamic poetry. Rather, the Qur’an repurposes an idiom associated\nwith a heroic canon of values and integrates it into a world- view in which the ultimate\nsignificance of human actions is determined by the will and eschatological verdict of a\n1 An antithetic use of the roots q- d- m and ʾ- kh- r also appears with other verb forms; see, e.g., Q 7:34, 15:24,\n48:2, 74:37.\nqaddama 569", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The verb qaraʾa has cognates in Aramaic (qrā) and Hebrew (qārāʾ),\nfrom which it may have been borrowed into Arabic (GQ 1:33 and FVQ 233). In Qur’anic\nArabic, qaraʾa generally means “to recite” rather than “to read,” even less “to read si-\nlently” (GQ 1:32–33). This emerges from its combination with the preposition ʿalā, “to,”\nfollowed by a designation of the respective audience (Q 17:106, 26:199, 84:21), and by\nthe unequivocal reference to audition in Q 7:204: “And when the recitation is recited\n(idhā quriʾa l-q urʾānu), then listenp to it (fa-s tamiʿū lahu) and be quiet, so that you may\nreceive mercy!” (KU 74). An exception is Q 96:1, where qaraʾa— here governing the\nprepositional object bi-s mi rabbika— may preserve the meaning of the cognate Hebrew\nphrase qārāʾ bəšēm YHWH (Peshitta: qrā b-s hmeh d-m āryā), which is to say that qaraʾa\nmay in this instance have the unusual meaning “to proclaim,” “to invoke” (see in detail\nu nder → ism).\nThe Qur’an seems to associate the activity designated by qaraʾa with religious texts (GQ\n1:82): as Jefery observes (FVQ 233), the objects of qaraʾa are predominantly the revela-\ntory proclamations conveyed by Muhammad and, in two cases, “the scripture” (→ al- kitāb;\nQ 10:94) or “a scripture” to be brought down from heaven (Q 17:93). Three verses have qaraʾa\nin connection with the individual rec ord books, also called kitāb, that w ill be read out on the\nday of judgement (Q 17:14.71, 69:19; see Graham 1984, 368, and Welch 1986, 400).\nTalā as a synonym. A synonym of qaraʾa is talā. Like qaraʾa, talā (whose verbal noun\ntilāwah occurs in Q 2:121) can take as its object a scripture (kitāb) or “the scripture”\n(Q 2:44.113.121, 4:127, 18:27, 29:45.48.51, 35:29), in one case also the Torah (Q 3:93), twice\n“a recitation” (qurʾān) or “the recitation” (Q 10:61, 27:92). In such cases, the rendering\n“to recite” imposes itself, with Q 10:61 and 27:92 corroborating that qaraʾa and talā can\nbe virtually equivalent. The same applies to verses commanding the Messenger to recite\n(talā) “what we have conveyed to you from the scripture of your Lord” (Q 18:27: wa-t lu\nmā ūḥiya ilayka min kitābi rabbika; similarly, 13:30 and 29:45), in so far as at least two\nof these three passages (Q 18:27, 29:45) involve a reference to God’s scripture. But even\nmore frequently, the object of talā consists in God’s “signs” (āyāt; e.g., Q 2:129.151.252,\n3:58.101.108.113.164, 8:2.31, 10:15, 19:58.73, 68:15, 83:13) or some revelatory “announce-\nment” or “tiding” (nabaʾ, Q 5:27, 7:175, 10:71, 26:69, 28:3). In passages falling into the\nlatter two categories, there is a good case for translating talā as “to recount,” given that\nthe contextual implication may not be word- for- word repetition.\n570 qaraʾa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The noun qurʾān is derived from the same\nconsontal root as qaraʾa (KU 74; GQ 1:32–33; Graham 1984, 364). Since its morphological\npattern fuʿlān is also attested for other verbal nouns (Wright 1974, 1:111), an inner-A rabic\nderivation of the noun qurʾān from the verb qaraʾa f aces no major obstacles, and the word\naccordingly signifies, in the first instance, the act of reciting. At the same time, modern\nWestern scholars have noted the similarity between Arabic qurʾān and Syriac qeryānā, and\nhave proposed that qurʾān is in fact an Arabisation of the latter, patterned on the maṣdar\nstructure fuʿlān (GQ 1:33–34; KU 74; Welch 1986, 400), or at least that the meaning of the\n“perfectly good and not infrequent” Arabic verbal noun qurʾān was subject to the semantic\ninfluence of Syriac qeryānā (Graham 1984, 365).1 Qeryānā can signify not only the activity\nof reading but a scriptural passage that is assigned as a liturgical reading (TS 3716; Graham\n1984, 365; Welch 1986, 400; Burkitt 1923, 5).2 But qeryānā can also mean the Bible in gen-\neral or specifically the Old Testament (SL 1409), thus forming an efective equivalent of\nHebrew miqraʾ, whose meanings encompass scripture, the reading of scripture, and indi-\nvidual scriptural prooftexts (DTTM 832; e.g., m. Nәd. 4:3; see also GQ 1:32; Horovitz 1923,\n67; Graham 1984, 366). Both the Syriac and the Hebrew cognates will have informed the\nway in which the Islamic scripture uses the noun qurʾān in three distinct though interre-\nlated senses: (i) the activity of recitation, (ii) the total corpus of revelatory proclamations\ndelivered by Muhammad, and (iii) an individual proclamation belonging to this corpus\n(Watt 1970, 135–136; Graham 1984, 369; Welch 1986, 401). While two other early Qur’anic\nself-d esignations, dhikr (e.g., Q 68:51–52, 81:27) and tadhkirah (e.g., Q 73:19, 74:54–55,\n80:11–12; see under → dhakkara), highlight the Qur’anic proclamations’ intended hortatory\nefect— namely, to remind their recipients of the divine judgement and to persuade them to\nact accordingly—t he term qurʾān underscores the Qur’anic proclamations’ quality of being\n“God’s holy word to be recited in worship” (Graham 1984, 366).\nBoth qaraʾa and the verbal noun qurʾān are prominently attested from the early Meccan\nperiod onwards. While it is not always pos sib le to privilege one of the three meanings just\nenumerated (see in more detail Graham 1984), each of the three categories is borne out by\nat least some passages that are sufficiently univocal. Thus, qurʾān as a verbal noun referring\nto the act of recitation— meaning (i) above—is on clear display in Q 75:17–18: “It is to us that\nits composition and recitation falls” (inna ʿalaynā jamʿahu wa- qurʾānah), avers the divine\nvoice and then goes on to instruct the Messenger to repeat what God recites to him: “when\nwe have recited it, follow its recitation” (fa- idhā qaraʾnāhu fa- ttabiʿ qurʾānah), a fter which\nit w ill devolve upon God to supply “clarification” of what has been revealed (v. 19: thumma\ninna ʿalaynā bayānah; see also u nder → bayyana). The same use of qurʾān to designate the\nact of recitation can be seen in Q 17:78, which bids the recipients to perform the “recitation\nat daybreak” (qurʾān al- fajr; see Rivlin 1934, 100–101), and 20:114, instructing Muhammad\n1 Graham notes that in the case of a direct borrowing from Syriac, one would have expected the form qiryān\n(Graham 1984, 365, with n. 20).\n2 Luxenberg infers from the link between qurʾān and qeryānā that “the Koran thus corresponds originally\nto the lectionarium (lectionary) still used in Western Chris tian ity today as a liturgical book containing excerpts\nfrom scripture to be read aloud during the ser vice” (Luxenberg 2007, 71). But even though qeryānā is sometimes,\nin passing, equated with a “lectionary” (e.g., El-B adawi 2014, 16; Neuwirth 2016a, 185), this does not seem to be\nentirely accurate: as substantiated by the references in the main text, a qeryānā is a scriptural reading or “lesson,”\nwhile a lectionary is a ktābā d-q eryānē (TS 3716; FVQ 234). Specifically in response to Luxenberg, one must\ninsist that the Qur’anic proclamations primarily style themselves as a recitation of the celestial scripture, i.e., as\na qurʾān of the celestial kitāb (e.g., Q 12:1–2) rather than a kitāb compiling qurʾāns.\nqaraʾa 571", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is one reason why qaraʾa and qurʾān cannot consistently be rendered as “to\nread” and “reading.” For instance, Q 75:17–18, just cited, suggest that when the Qur’anic\nMessenger recites a Qur’anic revelation for the first time, he does so by way of reproduc-\ning a prior divine recitation rather than by way of reading out a written document. Q 87:6\ntoo may hint that the Messenger’s inaugural recitation of a revelation is not mediated by\nwriting (“We shall cause youS to recite, and you will not forget,” sa- nuqriʾuka fa- lā tansā).\nNeither passage conclusively establishes the traditional view that Muhammad was illiterate,\nhowever, nor do they rule out that the Qur’anic proclamations may have been commit-\nted to writing already during Muhammad’s lifetime. When Q 29:49 says that the “clear\nsigns” conveyed by Muhammad are, or are intended to be, lodged “in the breasts of those\nwho have been given knowledge,” this could be an allusion to communal memorisation\nrather than merely to the recipients’ internalisation of the Qur’anic message.4 Overall, the\nevidence is too scarce to allow us to decide whether the “recitation at daybreak” (qurʾān\nal- fajr, Q 17:78), which would surely have involved a reuse of previously revealed Qur’anic\nmaterial, was based on memorisation, on transcripts of Muhammad’s inaugural proclama-\ntion of a given surah, or on both.\nDespite the prominence of the first meaning of qurʾān— namely, the act of recitation—\nin the early Meccan surahs, there is no evidence for a gradual inner- Qur’anic evolution\nfrom qurʾān = the act of recitation, as per meaning (i), to qurʾān = what is being recited, as\nper meanings (ii) and (iii). Rather, from early on the term qurʾān also refers to the textual\nobject of recitation. For example, the concluding couplet of Surah 85, vv. 21–22, affirms\nthe super natural origin of the preceding by saying that “it is a glorious recitation, // in a\nguarded tablet” (bal huwa qurʾānun majīd // fī lawḥin maḥfūẓ; see also under → kitāb).\nA structural parallel to Q 85:21–22 that also has the noun qurʾān occurs in Q 56:77–80:\n“It is a noble recitation (innahu la- qurʾānun karīm), // in a sheltered scripture (fī kitābin\nmaknūn), // touched only by those who are pure, // a sending- down from the Lord of the\nworld- dwellers.” Although Muhammad’s revelations are here traced back to a transcendent\npiece of writing, a celestial scripture (→ kitāb), their specific mode of conveyance and\nreception is oral and aural.\nIt is difficult to decide whether statements like Q 85:21 and 56:77 are to be construed\nin the second or the third meaning of qurʾān distinguished above, i.e., as referring to the\nentire corpus of revelations proclaimed by Muhammad or to an individual Qur’anic proc-\nlamation. In fact, the third meaning is unequivocally discernible only in a relatively small\nnumber of passages (Q 10:15.61, 13:31, 72:1; see also Radscheit 1996a, 86–87). The reason\nmay be that the sense of a single Qur’anic proclamation adheres more consistently to the\nterm → sūrah. Th ere is, however, the danger that as a result of l ater semantic developments,\nscholars may subconsciously give preference to what Graham calls the “collective” sense\nof qurʾān even where the individual one is perfectly pos si ble (e.g., Q 12:3; see Graham\n3 This first meaning of qurʾān remained operative even in early post- Qur’anic lit er a ture (Graham 1984,\n373–374).\n4 I am grateful to Saqib Hussain for directing my attention to this verse.\n572 qaraʾa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:595", "title": "Page 595", "locator": "pdf_page:595", "text": "1984, 369). It is noteworthy that despite the ultimate predominance of al- qurʾān as a title\nfor the corpus of Muhammad’s revelations, qurʾān in the archaic sense of an individual\nQur’anic proclamation continues to occur in the ḥadīth lit er a ture (Graham 1984, 374–375).\nIn interpreting specific occurrences of the term qurʾān in the Islamic scripture, therefore,\nit should be borne in mind that the applicable signification might be (iii) rather than (ii).\nOne might add the comparative observation that the New Testamental employment of\ngraphē, “scripture,” shows an ambiguity paralleling meanings (ii) and (iii) of qurʾān: graphē\ndenotes both the entire corpus of the Hebrew scriptures as well as an individual scriptural\npassage (TDNT 1:751–754).\nLike meaning (i), the second or “collective” sense of qurʾān is pre sent from very early\non. This is clearest in passages employing al- qurʾān with the definite article (“the recita-\ntion,” or perhaps “the Qur’anic recitations”) and without a preceding demonstrative (as in\nhādhā al- qurʾān, “this recitation,” at Q 12:3, which might in princi ple also refer to a specific\nQur’an-p roclamation; see Graham 1984, 371). Thus, Q 84:21 remonstrates that the address-\nees (who only figure elusively as “they” here) “do not prostrate themselves when the rec-\nitation is recited to them” (wa- idhā quriʾa ʿalayhimu l- qurʾānu lā yasjudūn); Q 55:2 credits\nGod with having “taught the recitation” (ʿallama l- qurʾān); and the same usage recurs in a\nsomewhat later Meccan passage, Q 76:23: “It was indeed we who sent the recitation down\nupon youS” (innā naḥnu nazzalnā ʿalayka l- qurʾāna tanzīlā). In subsequent Meccan texts,\nuse of al- qurʾān as a general appellation for Muhammad’s revelations becomes dominant\n(e.g., Q 20:2, 25:32, 27:6, 73:4). From a certain point in time, prob ably first in Q 20:113 and\n43:3, several verses qualify the noun qurʾān by the adjective ʿarabī, “Arabic,” highlighting\nthat the revelations proclaimed by Muhammad are composed in a linguistic medium that\ndifers from previous scriptural and parascriptural lit er a ture (see under → ʿarabī) and\nthereby makes God’s revelations accessible to a wider audience (Chabbi 2020, 70).\nThe expression al-q urʾān continues to appear in Medinan verses (Q 2:185, 4:82, 5:101,\n47:24, 59:21, 73:20).5 In one case (Q 9:111, on which see Graham 1984, 372–373), al-\nqurʾān even figures in what seems to be a tripartite list of scriptures together with the\nTorah (al-t awrāh) and the Gospel (al-i njīl). Even here, however, the term al-q urʾān is\nunlikely to express the notion of a closed corpus. Rather, al-q urʾān would most likely\nhave designated the entirety of proclamations delivered by Muhammad up until a given\ntime, and therefore a corpus that was in princi ple open to further additions as long as\nMuhammad was still alive. Despite the verses just referenced, it is noticeable that the\nbulk of occurrences of the term qurʾān and also of the verb qaraʾa are Meccan,6 and no\nMedinan occurrence of the word qurʾān links it with the adjective ʿarabī. This could\nindicate that the concept of forming an oral recitation in Arabic became a less crucial\naspect of the Qur’anic self- image as time went on. Still, recitation clearly remained part\nof the Qur’anic community’s ritual (Q 73:20),7 and the fact that much of the Meccan\ncorpus continued to be in communal use in the Medinan period would have ensured\nthat chronologically earlier statements remained known.\n5 There are no occurrences of the word qurʾān without the definite article in the Medinan surahs.\n6 There are only two Medinan occurrences of qaraʾa, both found in the insertion Q 73:20. But the verb talā\nremains frequent in Medinan texts.\n7 See Watt 1970, 141, observing that “it is a fact that the word qurʾān is seldom used in the latest passages”\n(see also ibid., 139–140). It is doubtful, however, whether this warrants Bell’s hypothesis of a development from\na qurʾān period to a kitāb period (a hypothesis that is presented and critiqued in Watt 1970, 137–141).\nqaraʾa 573", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In six Medinan verses, the divine voice counsels the\nQur’anic addressees or the historical Israelites to “give God a good loan” (Q 2:245, 5:12,\n57:11.18, 64:17, 73:20), which God will subsequently “multiply manifold” (Q 2:245, 57:11:\nfa-y uḍāʿifahu lahu ±​<aḍʿāfan kathīratan>; see similarly 57:18 and 64:17). The motif tends\nto occur in connection with charitable giving. Thus, Q 57:18 calls those prepared to “give\nGod a good loan” al-m uṣṣaddiqūn and al-m uṣṣaddiqāt, “men and women who make gifts\nof charity” (→ ṣadaqah), while Q 64:17 is preceded by a warning about the temptations\nemanating from property (Q 64:15) and the need for charitable spending (Q 64:16). In\nother cases, the loan motif is linked with militancy. This is clearest in Q 2:245, since the\npreceding verse urges the listeners to “fight on God’s path” (Q 2:244: wa-q ātilū fī sabīli\nllāhi). The three remaining verses containing the loan meta phor combine both conno-\ntations, charity and militancy. Q 5:12 demands that the Israelites aid God’s messengers\n(wa-ʿ azzartumūhum; see u nder → ummī), which is at least suggestive of activisim; but the\nIsraelites are in the same breath instructed to perform prayer and give alms (→ zakāh).\n574 qariba", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Fi nally, in Q 73:20 the loan motif immediately follows command-\nments to perform prayer and give alms, but slightly earlier there is again a reference to\n“fighting on God’s path.”\nLoaning unto God and Prov 19:17. The Qur’anic use of the loan motif, which\nforms part and parcel of the Qur’an’s frequent recourse to commercial meta phors\n(→ ajr, → ḥisāb, → sharā, → kasaba), is a resonance of the identification of charity with\n“lending unto God” in Prov 19:17 (Torrey 1892, 45; CQ 49; BEQ 446; Anderson 2013, 194–\n195, n. 18). Illustrating the impact of this Biblical statement, one of the hymns attributed\nto Ephrem explic itly compares alms and prayers to loans (Anderson 2013, 31–32, quoting\nBeck 1972b, no. 1:5–8), similar to the Qur’anic connection between loaning unto God, on\nthe one hand, and prayer and alms, on the other, in some of the passages just reviewed,\nespecially Q 73:20. Thus, the Qur’anic use of the loan meta phor is broadly continuous with\nthe reception history of Prov 19:17.\nAs regards the Qur’an’s distinctive extension of the loan meta phor to fighting on behalf\nof God, as seen most clearly in Q 2:245, this could have resulted from the Qur’an’s general\ntendency to bracket almsgiving and militancy closely together. Thus, Q 57:10 connects\n“fighting” and “spending” (verb: anfaqa) on God’s path, while 73:20 displays an equivalent\nassociation between fighting and almsgiving (zakāh). More indirectly, charitable giving and\nfighting are coupled in the Medinan surahs’ frequent injunctions to “contend with yourp\npossessions and your lives on God’s path” (Q 9:41: jāhidū bi-a mwālikum wa-a nfusikum\nfī sabīli llāhi; for other occurrences of the phrase, see Q 4:95, 8:72, 9:20.44.81.88, 49:15,\n61:11; → jāhada).

One of the meta phors forming part of the Qur’an’s extensive range of expressions\nfor the incapacitation and impairment of h uman hearts (→ qalb) is their hardness or divinely\ncaused hardening (for a comprehensive study comparing the Qur’anic and Biblical functions\nof the notion, see Räisänen 1976). The general point is that t hose afflicted with hardened\nhearts are punishably unresponsive to God. Thus, Q 2:74 accuses the Israelites of having\nhardened hearts “like stones or harder yet.” Q 5:13 goes further by saying that it was in fact\nGod who caused the Israelites’ hearts to be hard (jaʿalnā qulūbahum qāsiyatan) in retaliation\nfor their covenant-b reaking, in line with what seems to be the general Qur’anic doctrine\nthat God w ill eventually penalise humans who per sist ently turn away from him by unalter-\nably freezing them in unbelief and disobedience (see u nder → ḍalla and → khatama). In\nQ 10:88 Moses prays to God to harden the hearts of Phar aoh and his notables (wa- shdud ʿalā\nqulūbihim) “so that they w ill not believe u ntil they see the painful punishment,” a plea that\nsubsequently turns out to be fulfilled in vv. 90–92 (Sinai 2019a, 249). Q 6:42–43 generalises\nthe meta phor of hardened hearts (qasat qulūbuhum) to the e arlier communities to whom\nGod has sent messengers. According to Q 22:52–53, no previous messenger or prophet\nwas exempt from the dev il’s attempts to interfere with his “wishes”; God, however, will\n“cancel out” (nasakha) what the devil “casts” (alqā) into the respective messenger’s mind,\nand such Satanic attempts at tampering are in fact a divine test for “t hose in whose heart is\nsickness and the hard of heart,” the two expressions being ostensibly equivalent (→ maraḍ).\nTwo further passages apply the meta phor of hardened hearts to contemporaries of the\nQur’anic Messenger and make it particularly clear that being hard-h earted means being\ninsufficiently receptive to God and his revelations: Q 39:22 contrasts “the hard of heart”\n(al- qāsiyah qulūbuhum) with t hose “whose breast God has opened up to self-s urrender,”\nwhile Q 57:16 exhorts the believers that “it is time for their hearts to become submissive\nto God’s reminding exhortation” (a- lam yaʾni li- lladhīna āmanū an takhshaʿa qulūbuhum\nli- dhikri llāhi) and then asks them w hether “the term has proven too long for them, so that\ntheir hearts have become hard (fa- qasat qulūbuhum).”\nBiblical background. The expressions “hard of heart” and “to harden s.o.’s heart” are\nundeniably reminiscent of Biblical diction (AHW 178–180; Reynolds 2018, 268–269; for an\noverview of verses to do with hard-h eartedness in the Hebrew Bible, see TDOT 7:427–429).\nThe Pentateuchal Exodus narrative frequently attributes a hard or “heavy” heart to Phar aoh\n(and in one case to the Egyptian army following the Israelites into the sea), and some-\ntimes God is explic itly identified as the cause of such hardening (Exod 4:21, 7:3.13.14.22,\n9:7.12.34.35, 10:1.20.27, 11:10, 14:4.8.17; see Räisänen 1976, 52–56). Th ese Biblical passages\nform evident parallels to Q 10:88, even if the Qur’an departs from the Biblical narrative by\ntransforming God’s hardening of the Egyptians’ hearts into a request made by Moses. The\nHebrew Bible also pre sents God as hardening the hearts of other non-I sraelites (Deut 2:30,\nJos 11:20), and in Rom 9:17–18 Paul infers from the case of Phar aoh the general proposition\nthat God “has mercy on whomsoever he chooses” and “hardens whomsoever he chooses”\n576 qasā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 2:74 and 5:13, which specifically target the Israelites, resonate\nwith Biblical statements outside Exodus that ascribe obdurate hearts to the people of Israel\n(Ps 95:8, Isa 63:17, John 12:40). The explicit comparison of the Israelites’ hard hearts to\nstones in Q 2:74 resembles Ezek 11:19 and 36:26, where God announces that he w ill replace\nhearts of stone by hearts of flesh (AHW 180).\nIt is notable that the Peshitta renders many of the passages just rehearsed with the\nverbs qashshī, “to harden,” or etqashshī, “to be hardened” (Exod 7:3, 9:7.12.34, 10:1.20.27,\n11:10, 14:4.8, Ps 95:8, Isa 63:17, Rom 9:18; see also Deut 2:30), thus employing cognates of\nthe Arabic derivatives of q- s- w that figure in several Qur’anic passages. As Seidensticker\nnotes, Arabic is capable of expressing hardness of the heart by roots other than q-s -w ,\nsuch as ṣ- l- b (e.g., al- Aʿshā: ṣulb al- fuʾād; Ḥusayn 1983, no. 8:3). This further increases the\nlikelihood that the Qur’anic preference for q-s -w harks back to Aramaic diction (AHW\n178–180). One may add that in the Qur’an the root q- s- w only ever appears in connection\nwith hearts. All of these observations, however, render it even more notable that the one\nQur’anic passage that is closest to the Exodus trope of Pha raoh’s hardened heart, Q 10:88,\ndoes not use a derivative of q- s- w.\nOverall, there are clear affinities between the handful of Qur’anic verses mentioning\nhard- heartedness and Biblical language. However, one must not overlook that God’s in-\ncapacitation of h uman hearts is in the Qur’an more frequently articulated by means of the\nmeta phor of sealing someone’s heart, whose link to Biblical diction is less clear- cut (see\nunder → khatama).

The main Qur’anic word for “heart” is qalb, a term whose\nfrequency has been found to increase in the Medinan period compared to the Meccan one\n(AHW 89). A second Qur’anic word that is, like qalb, used both for the heart as an organ\nand the heart as an inner mental faculty is fuʾād, which is limited to Meccan surahs.1 There\ndoes not seem to be a principled semantic diference between the two expressions (AHW\n91–92, 112–114); both regularly figure together with the senses of sight and hearing,2 and in\nearly poetry, too, they appear in similar thematic contexts (AHW 62–63, 112–114). None-\ntheless, fuʾād would likely have had a more poetic stylistic valence (AHW 102–108). One\nmay also note that Qur’anic verses articulating Biblical notions of the heart (on which see\nbelow) exclusively opt for the word qalb. A third term, lubb, is confined to the stock phrase\nulū l- albāb (Q 2:179.197.269, 3:7.190, 5:100, 12:111, 13:19, 14:52, 38:29.43, 39:9.18.21, 40:54,\n65:10).3 While lubb is undoubtedly part of the same semantic field as qalb and fuʾād, it is\nuncertain whether it designates specifically the heart, despite being a cognate of Hebrew\nlēb/lēbāb or Syriac lebbā (AHW 133–134). Similar to other translators who eschew equating\nQur’anic lubb with “heart” (e.g., Arberry, Paret, Asad, Jones), I therefore opt to render ulū\nl- albāb as “ those endowed with insight,” in line with the epistemic contextual overtones\nof its Qur’anic occurrences.4\nThe heart as the centre of cognitive and perceptive pro cessing. Like other ancient\ntexts including the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the Qur’an identifies the seat of\nconscious thought and pro cessing with the heart rather than the brain (TDNT 3:605–614;\n1 The singular fuʾād or its plural afʾidah appear in Q 6:110.113, 11:120, 14:37.43, 16:78, 17:36, 23:78, 25:32, 28:10,\n32:9, 46:26, 53:11, 67:23, and 104:7.\n2 On qalb + samʿ + baṣar, see Q 2:7, 6:46, 16:108, 45:23; on fuʾād + samʿ + baṣar, see Q 16:78, 17:36, 23:78,\n32:9, 46:26, 67:23.\n3 Judging by their mean verse length, the earliest ones of these verses are Q 38:29.43.\n4 In early poetry, lubb can also occur in connection with love; see AHW 134–137.\n578 qalb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This cognitive dimension of the heart can be\nseen, for instance, in the frequent collocation of the heart with the senses of hearing (al-\nsamʿ) and sight (al-b aṣar; Q 2:7, 6:46, 16:78.108, 17:36, 23:78, 32:9, 45:23, 46:26, 67:23;\nsee also 7:179 and 22:46), which is evidently meant to function as a list of basic human\nperceptive and rational abilities. The heart’s prominent cognitive dimension in the Qur’an\nis also indicated by verses collocating qalb with the verb faqiha, “to understand” (Q 6:25,\n7:179, 9:87.127, 17:46, 18:57, 63:3; see McAulife 2002,408–409), or with its synonym\nʿaqala (Q 22:46; see also 59:14). It is however impor tant to appreciate that the kind of\nunderstanding at stake in these passages is not intellectual comprehension in general but\nspecifically the ability to apprehend divine revelations and signs (singular: → āyah). The\nheart is thus the mental faculty by which humans come to espouse and internalise core\nreligious truths—or fail to do so. Thus, in Q 5:41 the grammatical subject of “to believe”\n(→ āmana) is “their hearts” (wa-l am tuʾmin qulūbuhum; on the heart and belief, see also\nQ 49:7.14 and 58:22 and AHW 69–72), and according to Q 16:22 the hearts of those who\ndo not believe in the hereafter are in a state of rejection (munkirah; → ankara). In between\nthe states of belief and denial, hearts can also harbour doubt (noun: rayb, verb: → irtāba;\nsee Q 9:45.110, 24:50).5\nThe heart as the faculty of religious insight. The heart’s connection with religious\ninsight is also manifested by the fact that Qur’anic references to the heart display a peculiar\nassociation with the root dh- k- r, signifying exhortation by and about God (→ dhakkara).\nAccording to Q 50:37, “it”— meaning prob ably God’s obliteration of earlier generations,\nmentioned in the preceding verse— comprises “reminding exhortation (dhikrā) for anyone\nwho has a heart (li- man kāna lahu qalbun), or who will lend an ear and be a witness,” and\nvari ous verse endings assert that “t hose endowed with insight” (ulū l- albāb) will “heed\nGod’s hortatory reminders” (tadhakkarā; see Q 2:269, 3:7, 13:19, 14:52, 38:29, and 39:9;\nsee also 38:43, 39:21, and 40:54, all of which employ the noun dhikrā, “reminding ex-\nhortation,” and 65:10).6 Other passages declare that in response to God being mentioned\n(dhukira) or to “God’s reminding exhortation” (dhikr allāh),7 human hearts will “quake\nin fear” (wajila), “come to be secure” or “at peace” (iṭmaʾanna), “soften” (lāna), “rejoice”\n(istabshara), or “become submissive” (khashaʿa; see Q 8:2, 13:28, 22:35, 39:23.45, 57:16).\nBy contrast, the hearts of the unbelievers will recoil in disgust (ishmaʾazza; Q 39:45).8\nQ 22:32 and 49:3 connect the heart with the virtue of fearing God, taqwā (→ ittaqā). A\nlink between the heart and the emotion of eschatological fear in par tic u lar (which will\nthen motivate someone to engage in charitable giving) is also evident in Q 23:60, prais-\ning those “who give what they give, their hearts quaking in fear because they will return\nto their Lord (wa- qulūbuhum wajilatun annahum ilā rabbihim rājiʿūn).”9 Elsewhere too\n5 See also AHW 72, who additionally references Q 2:118.\n6 For other verses containing derivatives of the root dh- k- r and the noun qalb, see Q 5:13, 17:46, 18:28.57,\n39:22, 45:23.\n7 The genitive construction dhikr allāh in Q 13:28, 39:22–23, and 57:16 might also be deemed equivalent to\nthe temporal clause idhā dhukira llāhu in Q 8:2, 22:35, and 39:45 (see under → dhakkara).\n8 See also Q 22:54: “t hose who have been given knowledge” believe in God’s revelations, “and their hearts\nbecome h umble before it” (fa- tukhbita lahu qulūbuhum).\n9 The fear at stake h ere is prospective.

These afective and characterial aspects of the\nheart do not seem to be envisaged as an alternative to the rational grasp of religious truths,\nbut rather appear as something that complements, envelops, steadies, and deepens the\nheart’s cognitive espousal of core beliefs. Thus, even h umans who are already convinced\nof God’s existence and power may still desire their heart to find additional reassurance,\nor to “come to be secure” or “at peace” (iṭmaʾanna), through divinely wrought miracles:\nAbraham and the disciples of Jesus justify their request to witness God resurrect the dead\nor send down a table from heaven by the wish that their hearts may thereby “come to be\nsecure” (Q 2:260: li-y aṭmaʾinna qalbī; 5:113: wa-t aṭmaʾinna qulūbunā); and in Q 3:126\nthe Qur’an’s divine voice claims to have sent angels to reinforce the Medinan believers in\nbattle so that “through it your hearts may come to be secure” (li- taṭmaʾinna qulūbukum\nbihi; see also Q 8:10). Of t hese passages, at least the scene involving Abraham (Q 2:260)\nintimates an explicit distinction between belief, which Abraham claims to possess, and\nhis heart’s “coming to be secure,” which he aims to achieve by observing an act of divine\nresurrection. The same sequence of belief and fortification is reflected when the disciples\nprofess their belief in Q 5:111 and then go on to express their desire for peace of heart in\n5:113.11 Such reassurance of the heart is perhaps best understood as someone’s pre- existing\nbelief in God taking on a particularly firm and unwavering quality, as a believer becoming\nconfirmed in his antecedent commitment to God, by virtue of some act of divine grace.12\nThis understanding also fits Q 16:106, which condemns apostates but excepts those who\nonly abandon their faith u nder coercion while their hearts continue to be “secure in belief”\n(wa- qalbuhu muṭmaʾinnun bi- l- īmāni).\nThe heart as the faculty of receiving divine revelation. Given the heart’s crucial role\nin attaining religious insight and cultivating the proper afective stance t owards God, it\nis not surprising that the revelations that God “sends down” (→ nazzala) to the Qur’anic\nMessenger are specifically said to be conveyed to his heart (Q 2:97, 26:193–194). A some-\nwhat dif er ent scenario is implied by Q 53:10–11, which first assert that God “conveyed to\nhis servant what he conveyed to him” (fa- awḥā ilā ʿabdihi mā awḥā; → awḥā) and then\nadds that the Messenger’s heart ( here: fuʾād) “did not invent lies about what he saw” (mā\nkadhaba l- fuʾādu mā raʾā).

But the Messenger’s\nheart does seem to be the faculty responsible for pro cessing such revelatory visions and for\ntranslating them into truth- apt propositions. Once again, the heart emerges as the crucial\nhuman faculty in encountering God.\nThe heart and the interior dimension of personhood. Apart from being the organ\nof religious insight, the heart, like the breast (→ ṣadr), represents the inner dimension of\nhuman personhood, in contrast to people’s exterior utterances and actions (see also AHW\n10). Three Medinan verses juxtapose what p eople insincerely say “with their mouths” or\n“with their tongues” and what is in their hearts (Q 3:167, 5:41, 9:8, 48:11). God, however,\nknows (ʿalima) what is in people’s hearts (Q 4:63, 8:70, 33:51, 48:18; see also 2:204, 8:24,\nand 9:64), just as he knows what is in their souls and breasts (→ nafs, → ṣadr). Against the\nbackground of God’s unrestrained access to people’s inner lives, a Medinan verse (Q 33:5)\nreassures its recipients that “ there is no wrongdoing in any mistakes you may have com-\nmitted” regarding the prohibition of equating adoptive f athers with real f athers. Instead,\nwhat m atters are only “the intentions of your hearts” (mā taʿammadat qulūbukum). Q 2:225\nsimilarly stresses that God will only take the addressees to task for “what their hearts have\naccrued” (mā kasabat qulūbukum) rather than for “the idle swearing of oaths.” The heart is\nthus the locus of conscious agency, of weighing what one is to do, and a vital determinant\nof the true character and merit of any outward action.\nThe heart as the seat of human sociability. The heart is moreover presented as the seat\nof human sociability and fellow- feeling. God has “connected” or “reconciled your hearts,\nand by his grace you have become brethren” (fa- allafa bayna qulūbikum fa-a ṣbaḥtum\nbi- niʿmatihi ikhwānan), the believers are reminded in Q 3:103, and two other verses simi-\nlarly speak of a connection (allafa) between human hearts (Q 8:63, 9:60).14 The opposite\nof connected hearts are divided ones: “youS consider them a unity, but their hearts are\ndivided” (taḥsabuhum jamīʿan wa- qulūbuhum shattā), Q 59:14 says about the believers’\nopponents. The heart’s interpersonal dimension is also discernible in verses employing the\nsynonym fuʾād. In a prayer that Abraham utters on behalf of his Meccan descendants, he\nasks God to “make p eople’s hearts incline t owards them” (Q 14:37: fa- jʿal afʾidatan mina\nl- nāsi tahwī ilayhim).15 According to Q 28:10, when Moses’s mother abandoned him on\nthe Nile (Qur’anically, al- yamm), her heart “became void” (wa- aṣbaḥa fuʾādu ummi mūsā\nfārighan), meaning perhaps that she was exclusively preoccupied by worries about her\nson (Ṭab. 18:166–168) or that she was consumed by fear and anguish (Fakhr al- Dīn al- Rāzī\n13 Namely, if one considers the subject of mā raʾā to be the “servant” from v. 10 (who is identical with “yourp\ncompanion” from v. 2) rather than the heart. This reading is in my view decisively supported by the fact that\nat least for the occurrences of raʾā in vv. 12, 13, and 18, it is clear that the grammatical subject is the Qur’anic\nMessenger. See also AHW 83–84.\n14 At Q 9:60, al- muʾallafah qulūbuhum, “ those whose hearts are [to be] reconciled,” are listed as one of the\ngroups deserving gifts of charity (see u nder → zakāh). The expression is generally understood to refer to persons\nwhose loyalty to the Muslim community needed to be ensured by means of special payments (see the overview\nin SQ 522–523; e.g., Ṭab. 11:519–523 and Zam. 3:60; see also Watt 1956, 348–353, and AHW 71). In view of Q 3:103\nand 8:63, it is conceivable that the “connections” in question are t hose tying the hearts of the believers to one\nanother (rather than to, say, the cause of Islam). Perhaps the rationale for including al- muʾallafah qulūbuhum\namong the recipients of charity is merely that gifts of charity may be disbursed in the ser vice of what one might\ncall social cohesion, what ever the specific historical circumstances (which are quite likely unrecoverable).\n15 Note that the root h- w- y in the sense of desire is other wise associated with the soul (→ nafs).\nqalb 581", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 28:10 continues by saying that Moses’s m other almost\ndisclosed or betrayed him (in kādat la-t ubdī bihi) “had God not strengthened her heart to\nmake her one of the believers” (law- lā an rabaṭnā ʿalā qalbihā li- takūna mina l- muʾminīn).\nThis exemplifies another Qur’anic topos linked to the heart, namely, God’s exercising of a\ndirect emotional efect on it (see McAulife 2002, 408). Other passages mentioning divine\naction upon human hearts also employ qalb: God casts (alqā, qadhafa) terror (al-r uʿb)17\nin the hearts of the unbelievers (Q 3:151, 8:12, 33:26, 59:2), but he strengthens (rabaṭa\nʿalā) the hearts of believers (Q 8:11 and 18:14; cf. 28:10, just discussed). Q 48:4 describes\nwhat appears to be a similar experience of divine fortification by saying that God has\n“sent down (anzala) composure (→ al-s akīnah) into the believers’ hearts so that they\nmight increase in belief in addition to their [existing] belief.”18 In a similar vein, Q 64:11\nspeaks of God’s guidance of the believers’ hearts (wa-m an yuʾmin bi-l lāhi yahdi qalbahu),\nwhile Q 57:27 maintains that God placed tenderness, mercy, and rahbāniyyah (on which\nsee u nder → al-n aṣārā) in the hearts of Jesus’s followers. Yet despite the cons pic u ous\nswitch from fuʾād to qalb in Q 28:10, it is not the case that the term fuʾād is absent from\npassages asserting God’s fortification of human hearts, as shown by the expression thab-\nbata fuʾādahu, “to make s.o.’s heart firm” (Q 11:120, 25:32).19 An alternative expression for\nGod’s bracing of human hearts would seem to be the phrase “to widen or open up s.o.’s\nbreast” (sharaḥa ṣadrahu; e.g., Q 20:25 and 94:1), which almost always takes God as the\ngrammatical subject (→ ṣadr).\nIncapacitation of the heart. A very pronounced feature of the Qur’anic discourse about\nthe h uman heart is its multifarious terminology for the heart’s incapacitation and diminished\noperation (ERCQ 127–130). The relevant scriptural passages all employ qalb. Those who are\nunreceptive to God’s signs and revelations are described as hard (q- s- w) of heart (Q 2:74,\n6:43, 22:53, 39:22, 57:16; → qasā), as possessing hearts that are diseased (→ maraḍ), or as\n“separated by covers from” (fī akinnatin min) the preaching of the Qur’anic Messenger\n(Q 41:5).20 Hearts can be characterised by swerving (Q 3:7 and 9:117, using the verbal\nnoun zaygh and the verb zāgha), be guilty of sin (āthim; Q 2:283), be u nder “locks” (aqfāl;\nQ 47:24), or be covered with rust (Q 83:14). Two Medinan verses, Q 2:88 and 4:155, quote\nthe Israelites as claiming that their hearts are “wrapped in foreskins” (→ ghulf), reflect-\ning a Biblical trope chastising the Israelites for their uncircumcised hearts. The senses of\nhearing and sight too are sometimes described as impermeable to divine exhortation (see\nunder → ʿamiya), and the connection between both sets of meta phors is confirmed by a\nverse contrasting literal blindness with blindness of the heart (Q 22:46; see also CQ 47 and\nAHW 182–183, noting two Syriac parallels).\n16 On voidness of the heart, see also Q 14:43 (describing the confused state of those raised for the final\njudgement), a connection also made in Zam. 4:485 and Fakhr al- Dīn al- Rāzī 1981, 24:229.\n17 See also n. 27 below.\n18 Cf. Q 9:26.40, 48:18.26, which mention God’s “sending down” of “composure” onto his Messenger and\non the believers without singling out their hearts as its receptacles.\n19 Other objects of thabbata are a group’s “feet” (aqdām; Q 2:250, 3:147, 8:11, 47:7), or simply the Qur’anic\nbelievers or the Messenger as such (Q 8:12, 14:27, 16:102, 17:74).\n20 Note that Q 22:53 combines “ those in whose hearts is sickness” (alladhīna fī qulūbihim maraḍ) and “the\nhard- hearted” (al- qāsiyah qulūbuhum) to form an apparent pleonasm.\n582 qalb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

God c auses h uman hearts to be negligent of his\nhortatory reminders (Q 18:28: man aghfalnā qalbahu ʿan dhikrinā), he “turns them away”\n(ṣarafa; Q 9:127), and he is the one who causes hearts to swerve (azāgha; Q 3:8, 61:5).\nAt first blush, such language has seemingly unavoidable deterministic or predestinarian\nimplications. However, as explained in more detail elsewhere, closer inspection reveals\nthis to be questionable (→ khatama).\nThe heart and the vital self (nafs). The heart, in sum, is the faculty by which—at least\nif it is working properly— humans prove themselves receptive to God, while a defective\nheart is one that is closed of from God and impervious to his signs and revelations. What\nmakes a heart dysfunctional, therefore, is its deficient response to being addressed by God.\nThe manifold va rie ties of h uman egoism, by contrast, are attributed to the soul or vital self\n(→ nafs), and their existence appears to be taken for granted as a necessary concomitant\nof the human psyche. It is true that one must “restrain the soul from desire” (wa-n ahā\nl-n afsa ʿani l-h awā, Q 79:40) in order to merit entry to paradise. Yet the fact that the\nsoul continually brings forth egoistic appetites and urges, whose enactment may easily\nimplicate an agent in sinful behaviour, does not as such indicate any intrinsic characterial\ncorruption, and the Qur’an’s rich vocabulary for incapacitated and malfunctioning hearts\nhas no counterpart with regard to the nafs. Although the Qur’an does not explic itly de-\nscribe the relationship that obtains, or ought to obtain, between the heart and the soul\n(AHW 195), two verses imply that it is a malfunctioning heart that leaves someone at the\nmercy of unbridled desires (Q 47:16: ulāˈika lladhīna ṭabaʿa llāhu ʿalā qulūbihim wa- ttabaʿū\nahwāʾahum; 18:28: man aghfalnā qalbahu ʿan dhikrinā wa- ttabaʿa hawāhu): since desires\n(h- w- y) are associated with the nafs (see Q 2:87, 5:70, 53:23, 79:40), the two verses just\nadduced suggest that it is the heart that is ultimately understood to be responsible for\nrestraining the impulses of the soul or vital self.\nThe Qur’anic notion of the heart compared to poetry. As demonstrated elsewhere,\nQur’anic statements about the soul or vital self (→ nafs) exhibit notable continuity with\nthe way in which the latter figures in pre- Islamic poetry. One might accordingly expect a\nsimilar link to hold with regard to the Qur’an’s understanding of the heart. Yet here, any\nsimilarities are counterbalanced if not outweighed by impor tant diferences. It is true that\nthe Qur’anic collocation of the noun qalb with the verb iṭmaʾanna, “to be or come to be\nsecure or at peace,” has parallels in poetry: Zuhayr’s Muʿallaqah praises the one “whose\nheart has reached a state of secure right eousness” (man yufḍi qalbuhu ilā muṭmaʾinni l-\nbirri; DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 16:56; cf. AHW 53 and Arberry 1957, 117), and another poem by\nZuhayr includes a scene in which a noble steed is beaten “u ntil the back of his head was\nat peace, yet his heart and his muscles w ere not at peace” (wa- naḍribuhu ḥattā ṭmaʾanna\nqadhāluhu wa- lam yaṭmaʾinna qalbuhu wa- khaṣāʾiluh; DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 15:19; see also\nJacobi 1971, 188). But the phraseological parallel formed by the link of qalb and iṭmaʾanna\nonly highlights the absence of any reference to the notion of belief, which in the Qur’an\nis closely linked to tranquillity of the heart (see above). In the first Zuhayr quotation, the\nheart’s coming to be secure in right eousness (birr) has some pertinence to Qur’anic invoca-\ntions of the heart’s coming to be secure or at peace in belief. But what is being steadied and\ndeepened in Zuhayr is not the human relationship with God but interpersonal rectitude.\nqalb 583", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Two primary con-\ntexts stand out: on the one hand, interpersonal bonds and, on the other hand, fear and cour-\nage.21 First, the heart is prominently associated with love and erotic attraction, especially\nin the amatory opening sections of poems (AHW 43–44 and 207–235; for some examples,\nsee DSAAP, Zuhayr, nos 14:1 and 15:1; Ṭarafah, no. 13:9; al- Nābighah, no. 7:6; cf. Jacobi\n1971, 15–16, 36–37, 45).22 Bound by love and longing, the heart can even resist and disobey\n(ʿaṣā) its owner (Farrāj and Shākir 1963–1965, 43 and 196 = Abū Dhuʾayb, nos 2:5 and 25:2,\nand al-A ʿshā Maymūn in Ḥusayn 1983, no. 2:13, all of which are cited in AHW 257; see also\nAHW 253–254). Yet the heart is also understood to be capable of resolutely extricating itself\nfrom erotic entanglements (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 105:1). The heart is the seat of other kinds\nof intersubjective attachment as well: not only does it harbour longing for bygone loves\nand grief for the dead (e.g., Lyall 1918–1924, nos 38:4, 54:7, and 68:1–2, the latter of which\nuses fuʾād; Lyall 1913, ʿAbīd, no. 9:1; see AHW 44 and 261), but it also experiences maternal\nsolicitude (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 97:8, utilising fuʾād). When one poet declares that his heart\nis “mournfully estranged from” his tribe (anna l- fuʾāda nṭawā minhum ʿalā ḥazanī; Lyall\n1918–1924, no. 66:1), this suggests that the heart is vital to the ties connecting a person to his\ntribal group. At the same time, the heart is capable of harbouring emotions that disrupt and\nundermine interpersonal attachment, like hatred and rancour (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 27:13,\nusing fuʾād; other examples are given in AHW 45).\nSecondly, the heart is associated both with fear for one’s own safety (e.g., Lyall 1918–\n1924, no. 96:21; Lyall 1913, ʿAbīd, no. 1:26; for further examples, see AHW 44–45 and 262)\nand with the overcoming of such fear (AHW 46). As we just saw, the loving heart can defy\nits owner. Yet in connection with the theme of fear and courage, poets will boast of their\nhearts’ ready compliance: “wherever I go, my heart (lubbī, variant: qalbī) accompanies\nme, and I urge it on with firm resolve” (DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 21:79; cf. Arberry 1957, 183,\ntranslating a variant that has amr instead or raʾy). In the Lāmiyyat al-ʿ arab attributed to\nal- Shanfarā, the poet lists “a bold heart” (fuʾād mushayyaʿ; AHW 46 and 264) together\nwith his sword and bow as his three trusty companions (EAP 1:148).23 The heart’s role\nas the seat of valour and firm resolve is furthermore evident in a verse by Ṭafarah gloss-\ning “the coward” (al- habīt) as someone who “has no heart” (lā fuʾāda lahu), presumably\nmeaning someone lacking the ability to conquer his fear (DSAAP, Ṭafarah, no. 19:22; cf.\nJacobi 1971, 184; see also AHW 46).24 A bold heart enables its owner to exercise efective\nself- control, and poets accordingly boast of the “earnest striving” of their “noble heart”\n(jaddu lubbin aṣīlī; Lyall 1918–1924, no. 59:3) or of possessing a “keen heart” (qalb ḥadīd;\nLyall 1918–1924, no. 27:26). Not unlike the Qur’anic supposition that the intentions of\nhuman agents emerge from the heart (see Q 33:5), the heart is the place where choices are\nmade and where the ethical value of alternative courses of action is weighed: “whenever\n21 For a much more detailed taxonomy, see AHW 43–63, covering poetry up until the Umayyad period.\n22 For another example, see Lyall 1918–1924, nos 50:2 and 54:3, the former of which employs fuʾād rather\nthan qalb.\n23 On the question of this poem’s authenticity, see, e.g., EAP 1:139–140 and el Masri 2020, 24.\n24 Seidensticker assigns this verse both to the thematic category of the intellect (AHW 52), which seems a\ndoubtful classification to me, and to that of courage (AHW 46).\n584 qalb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Yet on the w hole, one is struck by the observa-\ntion, unsurprising though it may be, that pre-I slamic poetry consistently lacks the Qur’an’s\noverriding focus on the heart as the faculty by which h umans enter into a relationship with\nGod. Conversely, it is salient that the Qur’an contains no instances in which the heart is\nconnected with erotic love, grief, rancour, or courage, which between them account for\na majority of pre- Islamic verses evoking the heart, even if there is some overlap between\npoetry and the Qur’an in linking the heart to fear (AHW 64–66).25 There is accordingly a\nrather considerable disjuncture between the heart’s functions and repre sen ta tion in po-\netry and in the Qur’an. One may say that the Qur’an transforms the heart from a mental\nfaculty that is primarily concerned with interpersonal relationships and self- possession\nin the face of fear into a faculty that is primarily bound up with religious insight and with\nadopting the right emotional stance towards God. In par tic u lar the Qur’anic tendency to\nbond references to the heart with cognitive or epistemic language does not seem to have\nstrong parallels in pre- Islamic poetry, even if ʿAbīd ibn al- Abraṣ highlights that “trying to\ninstil wisdom has no benefit, unless the hearts are disposed to receive it” (wa- lā yanfaʿu\nl- talbībū // illā sajiyyātu mā l- qulūbi; Lyall 1913, ʿAbīd, no. 1:19–20; EAP 2:38–39; see also\nAHW 51–52).26 To highlight another contrast, even though both poetry and the Qur’an\nmention the heart in connection with fear, the poetic hero is meant to conquer his fear,\nwhile the Qur’an emphatically prizes awe vis-à - vis God and his revelations (Q 8:2, 22:35,\n23:60): the right kind of fear is to be cultivated, not suppressed.27\nBiblical aspects of the Qur’anic notion of the heart. The Qur’an’s appraisal of the\nhuman heart as the inward forum of humans’ relationship with God, which forms such a\ncons pic uo us contrast to pre-I slamic poetry, has a distinctly Biblical flavour (see also AHW\n176–186). The similarity is best showcased by means of a florilegium of Biblical verses. In\nDeut 6:5, the Israelites are famously charged to “love the Lord your God with all your heart,\n25 See Q 3:151, 8:2.12, 22:35, 23:60, 24:37, 33:10.26, 40:18, 59:2, 79:8 (almost all of which are quoted in AHW\n64–66).\n26 I follow Seidensticker in reading sajiyyātu in the nominative rather than the accusative (a reading also\nallowed by Jones). My translation of al- talbīb follows Jones, whereas Seidensticker renders the term as “grasping\nsomebody by the collar” (cf. the entry on labbah, “the middle of the breast,” in AEL 2643). Regarding the link\nbetween the heart and cognitive language, one may observe that in the extensive corpus of 931 references to the\nheart in early poetry up until the Umayyad period that has been analysed by Seidensticker, only two pre-I slamic\nand two further mukhaḍram passages (out of a respective total of 68 and 57 relevant passages) fall into the the-\nmatic category of the intellect (AHW 57), and even the assignment of some of these could be questioned (see\nthe cata logue in AHW 51–52; cf. also the further comments in AHW 176). By far the majority of the pre- Islamic\nmaterial (61.8%) belongs to the thematic category of love.\n27 The expression “the right kind of fear” is to be stressed here, for the Qur’an at least sometimes operates\nevident lexical distinctions between fear as a religious virtue, on the one hand, and fear in a neutral or negative\nsense, on the other: for example, the verb wajila, “to quake in fear,” occurs in depictions of religious awe (Q 8:2,\n22:35, 23:60, arguably also 15:52–53), while ruʿb, “terror,” is always used in a punitive or at least ominous sense\n(Q 3:151, 8:12, 18:18, 33:26, 59:2). However, no such distribution is evident for the generic verb khāfa, “to fear.”\nqalb 585", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Other Biblical\npassages reinforce the message that one is to search a fter, love, and serve God and fulfil\nhis statutes and ordinances “with all your heart and all your soul” (e.g., Deut 4:29, 10:12,\n11:13, 26:16; see also Josh 22:5, 1 Kgs 2:4, and 2 Kgs 23:3; see TDOT 7:430–431) and that\none’s heart must not “turn away from God” (Deut 29:17). Joshua commands the people to\n“put away the foreign Gods that are among you, and incline your hearts to the Lord, the\nGod of Israel” (Josh 24:23); Samuel urges them to serve God “with all your heart” (1 Sam\n12:20.24); and Solomon too invokes God’s faithfulness and mercy towards “your servants\nwho walk before you with all their heart” (1 Kgs 8:23). Nonetheless, in his old age Solomon’s\nwives “turned away his heart a fter other gods” (1 Kgs 11:2.4.9). The shortfallings of other\nJudaean kings are also noted with reference to the heart: for instance, about Jeroboam of\nIsrael it is said that “his heart was not w hole (šālēm) with the Lord his God, as the heart\nof David his father” (1 Kgs 15:3), while the heart of Asa, by contrast, “was whole with the\nLord all his days” (1 Kgs 15:14; see also 1 Kgs 8:61, 11:4; 2 Kgs 20:3; 1 Chr 29:19; 2 Chr 15:17).\nThe Psalmist gives thanks to God “with all my heart” (Ps 9:2), and the right eous is said to\nhave “the law of God in his heart” (Ps 37:31). God’s p eople have removed their heart from\nthe Lord, Isaiah charges (Isa 29:13, quoted in Matt 15:8 and Mark 7:6; see also the quota-\ntion in the Didascalia, in Vööbus 1979, 114). Jesus declares the “pure in heart” blessed, for\n“they w ill see God” (Matt 5:8).\nContrasting ancient pagan and ancient Jewish views of the h uman person, Peter Brown\nwrites that according to the latter, a believer “confronted God not as a soul committed, for\na time, to the necessary if thankless task of bringing order to an alien body, but rather as\nthe possessor of a ‘heart,’ that is, of a hidden core of the self, that could respond to or reject\nthe will of its Creator.” According to the Biblical tradition, the crucial dualism that defines the\nhuman condition is not between body and soul but rather between two orientations of the\nheart and of the w hole person governed by it: the heart might harden, “clenched in a state\nof mute rebellion to God’s w ill,” or it “might open itself fully” to God and “respond without\nreluctance” to him (Brown 1988, 35). Brown’s pithy characterisation holds just as true for\nthe Qur’an as for the Bible. To be sure, the Biblical conception of the heart is multifaceted\nand encompasses further aspects beyond mediating the h uman relationship to God, such\nas forming h umans’ vital centre and the general seat of h uman cognition and emotions (see\nagain the overview in TDOT 7:412–434). Th ere are also some notable disparities between\nQur’anic and Biblical diction related to the heart. For example, the Deuteronomistic phrase\n“with all your heart and all your soul,” establishing a close link between the heart and the soul,\nhas no counterpart in Qur’anic usage, which generally speaking keeps the heart and the\nsoul or nafs functionally distinct (see above and u nder → nafs). Nonetheless, the prominent\nrole that the Bible accords to the heart in articulating the relationship of h umans to God is\nundeniable; and given that this is also the foremost function of the heart in the Qur’an, it is\nhighly likely that this aspect of Qur’anic anthropology bespeaks the impact of Biblical notions\non the Qur’anic milieu, even if specific features of the Qur’an’s understanding of the heart\nare pertinently juxtaposed with pre-I slamic poetry as well.\nThe claim that the Qur’anic conception of the heart, unlike that of the soul or vital self\n(nafs), is to be placed against a Biblical background is further supported by a significant\nnumber of concrete phraseological parallels. When the Qur’an speaks of God’s “hardening”\nof p eople’s hearts (→ qasā) or has the Israelites claim that their hearts are “wrapped in fore-\n586 qalb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic statement that God “tests\nwhat is in yourp hearts” (Q 3:154: wa- li- yumaḥḥiṣa mā fī qulūbikum) echoes the Biblical\ntrope that God is the one who tries or searches the hearts (Ps 7:10; Jer 17:10; 1 Chr 28:9;\nRom 8:27; 1 Thess 2:4; Rev 2:23).28 The general proposition that God knows the contents\nof human hearts (e.g., Q 4:63) is of course also Biblical (1 Kgs 8:39; Ps 44:22 and 139:23;\nLuke 16:15; Acts 1:24 and 15:8; see TDOT 7:425–426 and TDNT 3:613; see also CQ 45).\nFin ally, the contrast between what p eople say “with their mouths” or “with their tongues”\nand what is in their hearts (Q 3:167, 5:41, 9:8, 48:11) is perhaps redolent of Isa 29:13 and its\nquotation in Matt 15:8 and Mark 7:6. As intimated earlier, all of these Biblically charged\nQur’anic statements about the heart use the word qalb. It may accordingly be suggested\nthat pre- Islamic Arabophone Christians and Jews would also have employed qalb, rather\nthan fuʾād, when rendering Biblically based tropes about the heart into Arabic.\nDo animals have a heart? By way of an addendum, it is worth noting that two of the\npoetic verses cited above attribute a heart, in the sense of a mental faculty rather than\nsimply a physical organ, to animals (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 97:8, referring to an antelope, and\nDSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 15:19, referring to a horse). Comparable passages attributing a heart\nto animals are lacking in the Qur’an, reflecting the latter’s much more anthropocentric\nportrayal of the animal kingdom in comparison to poetry (see Ambros 1990, 293). Intrigu-\ningly, a similar absence of references to animal hearts has been observed in the Hebrew\nBible (TDOT 7:412, noting some exceptions).\nqalāʾid pl. | ritual necklaces hung on sacrificial animals or animals marked\nout thereby (?)\n→ dhabaḥa\naqāma tr. | to perform or observe s.th.\nSee under → ṣallā and also under → injīl.\nqawm | people\nSee under → ummah.

According to the early Meccan passage Q 95:4, God\ncreated or creates man “in the best taqwīm” (fī aḥsani taqwīm). It is not unreasonable to\nunderstand Q 95:4 in light of the chronologically later parallels 40:64 and 64:3, which say\nthat God “ shaped youp and gave you beautiful shapes” (wa-ṣ awwarakum fa- aḥsana ṣuwar-\nakum). This would support glossing fī aḥsani taqwīm as fī aḥsani ṣūrah, “in the best shape”\n(thus the traditions cited in Ṭab. 24:510–512).1 From this vantage point, God’s creation of\nman fī aḥsani taqwīm might be rendered “in the best constitution.”\nBut it may be that Q 95:4 reflects a more specific idea. The Biblical scholar Ludwig\nKoehler once proposed that the Biblical term ṣelem, “image,” in Gen 1:26 (“Let us make\nman in our image, according to our likeness”; see also u nder → istakhlafa) refers to h umans’\nupright posture (Koehler 1948). The same understanding of Gen 1:26–27 is already found\nin the Greek Bible translation of Symmachus, who says that man was created orthios,\n“upright, standing” (Schreiner 1993, 136; see also Salvesen 1991, 2–3 and 6–7, who inter\nalia notes a reference to man’s upright posture in Gen. Rab. 8:11). Irrespective of w hether\nthis captures the original sense of Gen 1:26, it is worth considering w hether h umans’ erect\nposture might not be the meaning of the Qur’anic taqwīm in Q 95:4, which is in fact how\nan exegetical dictum cited by al- Ṭabarī construes the word (Ṭab. 24:512–513).2 This inter-\n1 Jefery maintains that the qiyāmah must be loaned from Christian Palestinian Aramaic rather than Syriac,\nbut there are at least some cases in which Syriac, too, employs qiyāmtā for the resurrection (SL 1363). A quanti-\ntative assessment of relative frequency of usage in Syriac vs Christian Palestinian Aramaic would require more\ndetailed examination of primary sources than seems to have been undertaken so far.\n1 On ṣūrah and ṣawwara, see in more detail under → istakhlafa.\n2 ʿAdī ibn Zayd, in his poem on creation, highlights that God “saw” Adam tamma wa-ʿ tadalā, which Dmitriev\ntranslates as “to be perfect and standing upright” (Dmitriev 2010, 360 and 363). This would obviously serve my\npre sent argument, though it is pos sib le that iʿtadala is merely a pleonasm of tamma here and has only the general\nsense of “to be symmetrical or proportionate.”\n588 qiyāmah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

An analogous case of such “cognate substitution” (Stewart 2009, 20–25)\noccurs in Q 105:2, where taḍlīl is used in lieu of ḍalāl (Müller 1969, 46–50; Stewart 2009,\n21). In fact, Müller argues that yet another instance of cognate substitution is found in the\nverse preceding Q 95:4, where amīn would seem to be employed in the sense of āmin (“se-\ncure”; Müller 1969, 54–58). Interestingly, there are no other instances of the second- form\nverb qawwama or its verbal noun taqwīm anywhere e lse in the Qur’an. Despite all of t hese\nconsiderations, however, and every thing that will be said below, the initial interpretation\nof fī aḥsani taqwīm above as having the more general sense of “in the best constitution”\nrather than “in the best posture” cannot be ruled out.\nQ 95:5 and human decrepitude in old age. Q 95:4 must evidently be read together\nwith its continuation in the following verse, 95:5. The latter proclaims that after God cre-\nated man in the best taqwīm, he “reduces him to the lowest of the low” (Q 95:5: thumma\nradadnāhu asfala sāfilīn). This is almost certainly a reference to h uman decrepitude in\nold age (thus, e.g., Ṭab. 24:513–514 and PP 188–189), an interpretation that is particularly\ncompelling in view of other Qur’anic statements that speak of t hose who are “reduced” or\n“returned” (radda, the same verb that also appears in Q 95:5) to senility in their old age\n(Q 16:70 and 22:5: wa-m inkum man yuraddu ilā ardhali l-ʿ umuri li-k ay lā yaʿlama baʿda /\nmin baʿdi ʿilmin shayʾan; see also 36:68 and 40:67, cited in KK 514). Also helpful for a\ncontextualised understanding of Q 95:4–5 is a passage by Jacob of Sarug. It contrasts the\nmarvellous nature of the human body that God has created with its subsequent decom-\nposition in death, resulting from Adam’s transgression of God’s command not to eat from\nthe forbidden tree (Mathews 2014, 20–31, ll. 51–150). Q 95:4–5 do not, of course, expressly\nrefer to Adam and his primordial act of disobedience. Yet the contrast that the Qur’anic\ncouplet sets out between the immanent perfection of the h uman body and its eventual\ndecay and dissolution resembles the passage by Jacob, thus lending further support to the\nview that Q 95:5 is about old age and death.\nThere is, however, a counter- argument to this geriatric line of interpretation of Q 95:5\nthat emerges from reading 95:4–5 together with 96:6: “except for those [or ‘not so those’]\nwho believe and do right eous deeds; they w ill have their rightfully earned wage (→ ajr).”\nTaking this together with vv. 4–5, one is apt to conclude that v. 5 must refer to posthumous\nperdition in hell rather than to old age and death. Yet Q 95:6 may well be a later insertion\n(e.g., PP 185 and 189) that induced (or perhaps was itself predicated on) reinterpretation\nof v. 5 as referring to damnation. To be sure, the double hypothesis that Q 95:5 is about old\nage and that 95:6 is a secondary addition does give rise to the question of how one is to\nunderstand the hypothetically original train of thought that would result from removing v.\n6, a train of thought leading from old age and death (v. 5) to the allegedly manifest character\nof the eschatological judgement in v. 7: “So what, then, makes you dismiss the judgement\nas a lie?” (fa- mā yukadhdhibuka baʿdu bi- l- dīn). Yet the worry that this transition might\nbe a non sequitur is allayed by another parallel from Jacob of Sarug, who teaches that the\ndemise of a h uman individual foreshadows and draws attention to the eventual dissolution\nof the world as a whole (Mathews 2014, 46–49, ll. 315–354). Jacob thus gives us a discur-\nsive trajectory leading from individual death to the end of the world and thereby also to\nGod’s eschatological judgement.

Qur’anic invocations of “the scripture”\nhave close counter parts in Jewish and Christian diction (see Künstlinger 1928, 239–241,\n1 As Horovitz correctly points out, the occurrence of the word kitāb in the Muʿallaqah of Zuhayr, where it\nwould appear to refer to a divine rec ord of h uman deeds, must be suspected of being due to l ater Islamic revision\nor expansion.

Like other core concepts of the Qur’anic world-v iew, such as the idea of divine\n“guidance” (see u nder → hadā), the Qur’anic notion of scripture must therefore be placed\nagainst the background of the Biblical tradition. This continuity should not, however, lead\none to overlook the distinctive features of the Qur’anic understanding of scripture, which\nthe pre sent entry w ill try to extract. The noun kitāb also figures in the collective term → ˻ahl\nal- kitāb, “the scripture- owners,” an umbrella category for the Jewish and Christian recipients\nof previous scriptural revelations that is treated elsewhere.\nThe two main senses of kitāb in the Qur’an. Very broadly, two principal Qur’anic usages\nof the noun kitāb may be distinguished, a celestial one and an earthly one.2 First, the term\nkitāb can refer to a transcendent book located in close proximity to God and uniting two\ndistinct functions. On the one hand, it serves as a comprehensive repository, or a kitāb\nin the sense of a “written rec ord,” of God’s knowledge and decrees, in line with the early\nMeccan assertion that God has “enumerated every thing in a written rec ord” (Q 78:29:\nwa-k ulla shayʾin aḥṣaynāhu kitābā; see also 11:6, 18:49, 23:62, 27:75, 35:11, 50:4; cf. also\n36:12 and 54:52–53, formulating the same idea without employing the word kitāb). On the\nother hand, this celestial book functions as the archetype or source of the Qur’anic revela-\ntions.3 Thus, Q 41:3 claims that the “signs” or “sign- pronouncements” (singular: → āyah)\ncontained in the heavenly scripture have been “expounded as an Arabic recitation so that\npeople might know” (kitābun fuṣṣilat āyātuhu qurʾānan ʿarabiyyan li- qawmin yaʿlamūn; see\nunder → faṣṣala, → qaraʾa, and → ʿarabī). This notion, too, is in evidence from the early\nMeccan period, since Q 56:77–79 posits that the “noble recitation” revealed to Muhammad\nis contained in, and therefore derived from, a “sheltered scripture” (kitāb maknūn) handled\nonly by “t hose who are pure” or “purified” (lā yamassuhu illā l- muṭahharūn), presumably\nangels (see u nder → malak). This archetypal celestial scripture must, moreover, be iden-\ntical with the “guarded tablet” (lawḥ maḥfūẓ) in which the Qur’anic recitations are stored\naccording to the early Meccan couplet Q 85:21–22. Another early Meccan expression of\nthe same idea is Q 80:11–16. The passage declares that “it”—p resumably, the proclamations\nconveyed by Muhammad—is a “reminder” (tadhkirah; → dhakkara) set down in “sheets”\n(ṣuḥuf; see further below) that are “honoured, elevated, purified,” which sheets are in turn\nsaid to be in the hands of “scribes” (safarah) who are “noble” (kirām). Like the “pure” or\n“purified” ones from Q 56:79, the noble scribes from 80:15–16 would seem to be angels\n(cf. Q 82:11, which applies to ostensibly angelic agents of surveillance the same attribute\nkirām also used in 80:16).4\n2 An overview of how premodern Islamic exegetes and modern Western scholars have understood the nu-\nmerous Qur’anic uses of the word kitāb is provided in Goudarzi 2018, 16–95. For a comprehensive study of the\nsemantics of the noun kitāb and the consonantal root k- t- b in the Qur’an, see Madigan 2001, proposing a unitary\ninterpretation of the term kitāb “as a symbol for God’s knowledge and authoritative will” (Madigan 2001, 107).\n3 On the Qur’anic notion of the celestial scripture, see, e.g., Sprenger 1869, 2:286–297; Grimme 1895, 72–75;\nGQ 1:80; Pedersen 1914, 114–115. A detailed review of pertinent scholarship is provided in Goudarzi 2018, 56–70\nand 81–82. As Goudarzi shows, when scholars speak of the celestial scripture as an “archetype” or “source” of\nearthly revelations (e.g., Nöldeke 1892, 51, referring to the Qur’an’s “celestial textual original” or himmlischen\nOriginaltext), this harks back to the Arabic term aṣl, which is employed to describe the relationship between the\nQur’an and the celestial “mother- scripture” in the medieval commentary tradition (Goudarzi 2018, 27–29; e.g.,\nṬab. 20:546–547 = on Q 43:4). The term “archetype” was first employed by Hubert Grimme (Goudarzi 2018,\n63; Grimme 1895, 72–73).\n4 Ben- Shammai objects that this equivalence between an archetypal celestial kitāb and the ṣuḥuf of Q 80:13\nas well as the lawḥ of 85:22 “can hardly be sustained witout the support of Muslim exegetical tradition” (Ben-\nShammai 2013, 9); but it seems reasonably safe to me that Q 56:77–79 (which has the word kitāb), 80:11–16,\n592 kitāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Particularly\nstrong support for considering God’s universal rec ord and the celestial archetype of\nscriptural revelations to be one and the same entity is supplied by the fact that both the\narchetype of the Qur’anic recitations and God’s universal rec ord are designated as umm\nal-k itāb, “the mother of the scripture”: according to Q 43:4, “it”— namely, the “Arabic\nrecitation” (qurʾān ʿarabī) mentioned in the preceding verse— “is in the mother- scripture\nwith us, sublime and wise” (wa- innahu fī ummi l- kitābi ladaynā la-ʿ aliyyun ḥakīm),6 while\nQ 13:39 says that “God erases and sets down what he w ills; with him is the mother-s cripture”\n(yamḥū llāhu mā yashāʾu wa-y uthbitu wa-ʿ indahu ummu l-k itāb; see also u nder → ajal). The\numm al- kitāb, then, is both “the source of e very scripture” (aṣl kull kitāb), as al- Zamaksharī\nglosses the expression (Zam. 3:357, on Q 13:39; cf. similarly Zam. 5:425, on Q 43:4),7 and\nthe ultimate register of all events whose future portions God is free to manipulate at will.8\nIncidentally, in the Medinan verse Q 3:7 the expression umm al- kitāb conveys a very dif-\nfer ent meaning, referring to those portions of the Qur’anic corpus that are not beset by\ninterpretive ambiguity (see under → bayyana).\nThe second main Qur’anic usage of the term kitāb is as a label for earthly scriptures that\noriginate from the celestial archetype by way of divine revelation. Thus, the Qur’an speaks\nof “the scripture of Moses” (kitāb mūsā; Q 11:17, 46:12; cf. Syriac ktābeh d- mūshē, Mathews\n2020, 18–19, l. 1939) or “the scripture brought by Moses” (Q 6:91: al- kitāb alladhī jāʾa bihi\nmūsā), meaning the Torah (→ al- tawrāh). The revelations conveyed by Muhammad, too, are\nreferred to as a “scripture” in their own right (e.g., Q 2:89, 6:92.155, 46:30). This application of\nkitāb to earthly scriptures is already seen in the early Meccan verse Q 68:37, which challenges\nthose refusing to believe in the Qur’an’s eschatological message by asking them w hether their\nviews are supported by “a scripture in which you study” (am lakum kitābun fīhi tadrusūn; cf.\nalso the early Meccan statement Q 37:157). Moreover, when Q 37:117 says that God gave “the\nand 85:21–22 are very closely related. Q 85:22 has a reading variant that construes maḥfūẓ as a nominative rather\nthan a genitive, and therefore as an attribute of qurʾān rather than of lawḥ (MQ 10:373; MQQ 8:109–110). This is\ngrammatically feasible. Similar grammatical ambiguity is found in Q 56:77–78 (fī kitābin maknūn) and 80:11.13–14\n(“No, it is a reminder! // . . . / / [Contained] in sheets honoured, // elevated, purified”). Yet in the latter instance,\nthe adjectives mukarramah, marfūʿah, and muṭahharah must for contextual reasons be construed as attributes\nof the “sheets” (ṣuḥuf) rather than of the “reminder” (tadhkirah). On the premise that the three early Meccan\npassages at hand are closely related, it seems logical to extend the same construal to Q 85:22 and 56:78.\n5 This is at least implied in Jefery’s distinction between “kitāb as heavenly book” and “kitāb as Scripture”\n(Jefery 1952, 17).\n6 Even though grammatically the true predicate h ere is la-ʿ aliyyun ḥakīm, I am inclined to understand Q 43:4\nto convey, first, that the Qur’anic recitations are derived from or inhere “in” the celestial scripture (cf. the use of\nfī in Q 56:78, 80:13, and 85:22) and, secondly, that they are sublime and wise. By contrast, Paret 2001 envisages\nthat Q 43:4 might be saying that the “Arabic recitation” received by Muhammad is reckoned to be “sublime and\nwise” in the “mother- scripture,” understood to be a universal rec ord of all things.\n7 Al- Zamaksharī is here echoing early exegetical traditions like t hose compiled in Ṭab. 20:546–547, such\nas Qatādah’s alleged gloss on Q 43:4 that the umm al- kitāb is “the source of the scripture and its totality” (aṣl\nal- kitāb wa- jumlatuhu).\n8 Th ere is exegetical disagreement as to w hether God’s “erasing” and “setting down” is tantamount to chang-\ning the mother-s cripture itself or simply amounts to adjusting some other book or books in accordance with the\nunchanging mother-s cripture. See Ṭab. 13:562–563. I consider it more likely that the point of Q 13:39 is to say\nthat God wields complete control over the mother- scripture.\nkitāb 593", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Specifically, Goudarzi’s two-k itāb hypothesis means that the → injīl (usually\nunderstood to be the Gospel) does not occupy the rank of a fully fledged kitāb. The argu-\nment is rigorous and sophisticated, and it is certainly striking that Q 4:136 lists only two\nscriptures, one sent down upon Muhammad (al- kitāb alladhī nazzala ʿalā rasūlihi) and\nanother one “sent down before” (al- kitāb alladhī anzala min qablu), rather than referring\nto Muhammad’s scripture and two previous ones (Goudarzi 2018, 110–111). A two-k itāb\nscenario is also implied by other passages, such as Q 6:91–92, 11:17, and 46:12.30. On the\nother hand, Q 2:285 and also 4:136—w hich latter was just partially cited—s peak of God’s\n“scriptures” (kutubihi) in the plural rather than in the dual, thus contravening what one\nmight have expected on the two-k itāb hypothesis.10 Th ese references to “scriptures” in the\nplural do not conclusively disprove the two- kitāb hypothesis (see Goudarzi 2018, 159–161),\nbut they do make it attractive to consider alternative solutions for the singular reference to\n“the scripture sent down before” the Qur’an (al- kitāb alladhī anzala min qablu) in Q 4:136,\nespecially given the allusion to a plurality of divine “scriptures” (kutub) later on in the\nverse. Thus, one might insist that Q 4:136 does not need to be understood as providing an\nexhaustive list of pre- Qur’anic scriptures and that it may well limit itself to juxtaposing\nthe Qur’an with the most prominent pred e ces sor scripture, that of Moses (of which the\nQur’anic → injīl is perhaps to be considered a divinely mandated re- edition, as explained\nin the respective entry). The plural kutub later in Q 4:136 might then be understood to\ninclude the injīl as well.\nCelestial and terrestrial scriptures in pre- Qur’anic traditions. Both of the main de-\nnotations of Qur’anic kitāb have ample pre- Qur’anic antecedent. To commence at the\nmost general level, the Qur’anic employment of kitāb as a descriptor of earthly scriptures\nis reminiscent, for instance, of passages from the New Testament like Matt 21:42 and 26:54\nor John 7:38.42, which invoke “the scripture” (hē graphē) or “the scriptures” (hai graphai),\nmeaning the Hebrew Bible; a graphē can also be an individual scriptural passage (for much\nmore detail on the Greek term, see TDNT 1:751–761).11 The Peshitta renders these verses\nwith cognates of the Arabic noun kitāb, namely, the singular ktābā or the plural ktābē, a\nusage that is also found in subsequent Syriac lit er a ture (e.g., Beck 1970a, no. 2:1557). Rab-\nbinic texts, meanwhile, speak of “the holy scriptures” (kitbē ha- qodesh; e.g., m. Yad. 3:5\n9 God’s “giving” of “the scripture” to Moses recurs in a string of later verses, such as Q 2:53.87 or 41:45.\n10 See also Q 66:12, according to which Mary believed in God’s “scriptures.” Historically, of course, one\nwould have expected Mary to have been familiar with only one divinely revealed scripture, the Torah, and even\nthe ministry of her son would only have brought the number up to two. It is conceivable that the plural kutub\nin Q 66:12 is simply an echo of the credal passages cited in the main text. On the other hand, it should be noted\nthat there is also the reading variant kitāb in the singular here, allegedly to be identified with the injīl (MQ 9:533;\nMQQ 7:180). But a singular reading could of course also intend the Torah. Perhaps the most likely hypothesis\nis that an original singular, asserting Mary’s faithfulness to the ancestral Israelite scripture, was read as a plural\ndue to assimilation of Q 66:12 with 2:285 and 4:136.\n11 Similar references to “the scripture” also occur in the Septuagint; see, e.g., 1 Chr 15:15, stating that the\nark of the Lord was carried “according to the scripture,” kata tēn graphēn. This qualification is not found in the\nHebrew text. See also the same phrase at 2 Chr 30:5 (where it renders Hebrew kakkātûb).\n594 kitāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

To the Biblical\n“scripture,” then, the Qur’an adds a second earthly kitāb consisting in the corpus of reve-\nlations granted to Muhammad.\nAs regards the Qur’an’s application of the term kitāb to a celestial register- cum-a rchetype,\nthe notion of a transcendent ledger has precursors going back as far as ancient Mesopotamia,\nincluding the Hebrew Bible, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the New Testament, and rabbinic lit er a ture\n(Jefery 1952, 9–10; Paul 1973).12 Most pertinent to the Qur’an are the heavenly tablets that\nfigure throughout the Book of Jubilees (VanderKam 1989) and contain normative command-\nments (e.g., Jubilees 3:10–11, 3:31, 4:5, 4:32, 6:17, 32:28–29), God’s ordainments regarding the\nfuture course of history (see Jubilees 16:3, 23:32, 24:33, 32:21), and retrospective assessments of\nthe religious and moral merit of h uman individuals (Jubilees 19:9, 30:19–20, 30:22).13 Heavenly\ntablets likewise appear briefly in 1 Enoch 81:1–2 (according to which Enoch finds them to\ncontain “all the deeds of humanity”), 93:2, 103:2, and 106:19 (Charlesworth 1983, 59, 74, 83,\n87). Obviously, the heavenly tablets from 1 Enoch and Jubilees are particularly reminiscent of\nthe “guarded tablet” (lawḥ maḥfūẓ) mentioned in the early Meccan verse Q 85:22; but the\ncomprehensive character of the heavenly tablets in Jubilees (encompassing commandments,\npast history, f uture decrees, and moral verdicts) also matches the similarly comprehensive\ncontent that was argued above to be attributable to the Qur’an’s celestial kitāb. At the same\ntime, the general Qur’anic notion of a heavenly kitāb also resonates with rabbinic conceptions\nof the pre- existent Torah, identified with the primordial wisdom of Prov 8:22–31 (Urbach\n1987, 1:287; Hamerton-K elly 1973, 19–20).\nA final pre- Qur’anic parallel worth noting in the pre sent context concerns the ex-\npression umm al-k itāb (the “mother- scripture” or “source- scripture”), which has an\nintriguing twin in a metrical homily by Ephrem. After elaborating in some detail how\nall human utterances and actions are unfailingly recorded in preparation for the final\njudgement, Ephrem declares that it is in fact in God’s mind that they are inscribed\n(Beck 1970a, no. 3:121–124): “The record book [of God] is his mind; in it every thing is\ncontained. // The mother of books (emmā d-s eprē) is his thought; in it he has written\nand keeps writing.” Even though the “books” (seprē) to which Ephrem alludes here are\nnot the Biblical scriptures but rather the rec ords of deeds that will play a role at the last\njudgement (see below), the expression emmā d- seprē is clearly redolent of the Qur’anic\numm al- kitāb, and both invoke the meta phor of motherhood in order to describe some\nentity as the origin and source of something e lse (cf. Beck 1970a, no. 3:381–386, inter alia\ndescribing justice as “the m other of punishments,” and the translator’s note on Beck 1970a,\nno. 3:123). The parallel, compelling though it is, should not however be taken to entail\nthat the Qur’an, too, understands the mother- scripture to be identical with the divine\nmind, given that the celestial scripture is described in concrete and objectifying terms as\n12 As noted by Horovitz (KU 67), b. Meg. 16a designates the idea of a celestial rec ord of human actions\nwith a cognate of Arabic kitāb, namely, as a “writing that is up above” (ktab she- lә- maʿlah). For other rabbinic\nreferences, see Paul 1973, 350–351.\n13 On the content of the heavenly tablets in Jubilees, see generally García Martínez 1997.

Thus, in accordance\nwith the basic lexical meaning of the verb kataba, “to write” (e.g., Q 24:33; see Madigan\n2001, 117–118), a kitāb can be a human piece or instance of writing, such as the letter\nsent by Solomon to the queen of Sabaʾ in Q 27:28–29 or the legal document, most likely\na marriage contract, mentioned in Q 24:33 (on which see Crone 1994a, 3–6). In a more\nfigurative usage, the word kitāb can designate an individual divine decree (e.g., Q 15:4)\nor an authoritative divine commandment or prescription (Q 4:24). In these latter cases,\nthe Qur’an also employs corresponding verbal locutions (see in more detail Madigan\n2001, 107–117): God’s determining of future events or the allocation of rewards and pun-\nishments can be expressed by saying that he “has written” (kataba) a specific outcome\n“against” or “for” somebody (e.g., Q 3:154, 7:156, 9:51, 59:3), and kataba + acc. + ʿalā (“to\nimpose s.th. upon s.o., to prescribe s.th. to s.o.”) is also a frequent manner of conveying\nthat God has imposed a certain behavioural prescription (e.g., Q 2:178.180.183.216.246).\nIn so far as such individual divine ordainments and prescriptions are presumably con-\ntained in, documented by, or based on the celestial kitāb (Goudarzi 2018, 269–271), they\nhave a clear link to the first of the two primary meanings outlined above, and it is at\nleast sometimes appropriate to translate kitāb in this sense as a “written decree” rather\nthan just a “decree” (e.g., Q 13:38: li- kulli ajalin kitāb, “for every term there is a written\ndecree”; see under → ajal).\nThe display of rec ord books on the day of judgement. A specific thematic context in\nwhich the word kitāb occurs is God’s final judgement of the resurrected. This motif, too,\ngoes back to the early Meccan period. Thus, in Q 69:19.25 and 84:7.10 the term kitāb—\nwhose basic meaning here is “writ” or “written rec ord”— denotes individual registers of\ngood and evil h uman deeds that the resurrected receive in their right hand or, ominously,\nin their left hand (see also under → ḥisāb). These individual registers of good and bad\ndeeds, which recur in the later Meccan surah Q 17 (Q 17:13–14.71), should prob ably be\nunderstood as transcripts drawn from God’s universal kitāb, as alluded to in Q 78:29. Q 83,\nalso early Meccan, envisages two collective eschatological registers, one for the right eous\nand one for the sinners, rather than individual transcripts (Q 83:7.9.18.20). Apart from\nQ 17:13–14.71, later Meccan passages tend to speak of collective rather than individual\neschatological inventories. Q 45:28 seems to posit registers specific to each human com-\nmunity (singular: → ummah), although the following verse, 45:29, then refers simply to\n“our”— i.e., God’s—k itāb. According to Q 18:49 and 39:69 it is “the kitāb”— prob ably God’s\nuniversal rec ord book itself— that will be presented at the judgement (wuḍiʿa l- kitābu).\nIn the background of this motif of the eschatological display of individual or collective\nrec ord books stand Dan 7:10 and Rev 20:12, mentioning the opening of “books” (Biblical\nAramaic: siprîn, Greek: biblia, Peshitta: seprē) in preparation for the last judgement. The\nmotif resonates in subsequent Syriac lit er a ture like metrical homilies by or attributed to\nEphrem (Beck 1970a, no. 2:585–588, no. 3:138, and no. 5:332–335).

This\nrecalls the kitāb mentioned in Q 18:49 and 39:69. What is notable, though, is how the\nQur’anic use of the term kitāb— encompassing as it does both a universal divine register\nin addition to any further registers, collective or individual, that might be deployed on\nthe day of judgement as well as the celestial archetype of all earthly scriptures and the\nrevelatory manifestations of this archetype in human history—u nifies meanings that in\nSyriac are distributed between the words ktābā/ktābē, referring to the Biblical scripture\nor scriptures, and seprā/seprē, referring to the eschatological registers from Dan 7:10 and\nRev 20:12. The Qur’anic understanding that these dif er ent rec ords and scriptures are all\nidentical with or manifestations of one and the same celestial mother-s cripture has con-\nsiderable conceptual elegance.\nTwo alternative early Meccan terms for the concept of scripture: ṣuḥuf and zubur.\nDespite the use of the word kitāb for God’s comprehensive rec ord book in Q 78:29 and\nthe reference to an archetypal heavenly kitāb in Q 56:77–78,14 other early Meccan passages\nexpress the notion of scripture not with the word kitāb but with the plural ṣuḥuf (see gen-\nerally NB 50; KU 68–69; GQ 2:24; CQ 23; FVQ 192–194; Ben- Shammai 2013). Its singular\nṣaḥīfah, which does not occur in the Qur’anic text, and the plural forms ṣuḥuf and ṣaḥāʾif are\nattested in poetry (DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 27:2; Abū l-F araj al-I ṣbahānī 1927–1974, 22:358, l.\n7; Ben- Shammai 2013, 5–7), on which basis Ben Shammai infers that a ṣaḥīfah is “a sheet of\npliable material, such as parchment or papyrus, which can be rolled up—h ence, a scroll.”\nSome early Meccan passages employ the word ṣuḥuf in meanings that approximate t hose\nthat are elsewhere in the Qur’an expressed by the noun kitāb. For instance, Q 53:36–37\nrefer to ṣuḥuf mūsā // wa-i brāhīma lladhī waffā, “the writings of Moses // and of Abraham,\nwho fulfilled his obligation.”15 The ṣuḥuf at hand must be a textual corpus that is in some\nfashion connected with Abraham and Moses (though not necessarily in the sense of having\nbeen authored by or transmitted from them). The verses following Q 53:36–37 helpfully\ngo on to provide a summary of the principal teachings attributed to t hese ṣuḥuf, namely:\nindividual eschatological accountability (Q 53:38–42), God’s supremacy, including his\npower to resurrect the dead (Q 53:43–49), and God’s chastisement of sinful collectives in\nthe past (Q 53:50–54; see generally Gibb 1962, 272–280; Sinai 2011a, 16–18; PP 661–666\nand 671). The “writings of Moses and Abraham,” in other words, contain the same mes-\nsage as the Qur’anic revelations,16 a parallelism that is further stressed by the conclusion\nof the passage (Q 53:56): “This is a warning like the ancient warnings” (hādhā nadhīrun\nmina l- nudhuri l-ū lā). The principal point emerging from Q 53:36–56— namely, that the\nQur’anic proclamations are imparting the same kerygma as an earlier corpus of writings\nassociated with Abraham and Moses—is also made, more succinctly, in Q 87:18–19, which\nmaintain that “this” (i.e., the Qur’anic revelations’ basic message and/or the eschatological\npreaching of the immediately preceding verses) is “in” (i.e., corresponds to or parallels)\n14 See also the oath by “a kitāb written down” (wa- kitābin masṭūr) in Q 52:2. In this regard, Neuwirth cites\nthe oath by “the pen and what is written down” in Q 68:1 (wa- l- qalami wa- mā yasṭurūn) and makes a plausible\ncase that 52:2 intends the celestial scripture (PP 693–694). Goudarzi considers the Torah a pos si ble candidate\nas well (Goudarzi 2018, 307).\n15 Q 53:37 is most likely an allusion to Abraham’s readiness to ofer up his own son as a sacrifice to God; see\nQ 37:102–107 and, less transparently, 2:124. See also PP 662.\n16 Cf. especially Q 53:38 (allā taziru wāziratun wizra ukhrā, “that no one will bear anyone else’s burden”)\nand the identical phrasing in 6:164, 17:15, 35:18, and 39:7. As Gibb points out, this has a parallel in Gal 6:5 (“For\nall must carry their own loads”; see Gibb 1962, 274).

Yet nothing about Q 53:36–56 and 87:18–19 suggests\nthat the writings in question are specifically apocalyptic in nature and that the “writings\nof Moses and Abraham” refer to lit er a ture like the Apocalypse of Abraham rather than to\nthe Biblical canon, however difusely conceived.17 Instead, as we saw above, the ancient\nwritings of Abraham and Moses are portrayed as containing the core teachings of the\nearly Meccan Qur’an. It seems much more likely, therefore, that Q 53:36–56 and 87:18–19\nsimply anticipate the later Qur’anic motif that the corpus of revelations proclaimed by\nMuhammad is a “confirmation (taṣdīq) of what precedes it” (e.g., Q 10:37; → ṣaddaqa),\nthe object of such confirmation being in par tic u lar “the scripture of Moses” (kitāb mūsā;\nQ 46:12; see also 46:30) or “the scripture brought by Moses (al-k itāb alladhī jāʾa bihi\nmūsā; Q 6:91–92). The “ṣuḥuf of Moses and Abraham,” in other words, may well refer\nto some form of the Biblical canon, notions of which may have been blurred in the early\nMeccan period but would presumably have encompassed a basic awareness that the Bible\nhad something to say about Abraham and Moses, and also that parts of it w ere believed\nto have been revealed to the latter.\nSome sort of equivalence between the plural ṣuḥuf and the singular kitāb is also plausi-\nble for Q 80:13–16 (already referenced above), where it is declared that the “reminder” or\n“reminding exhortation” (tadhkirah) brought by Muhammad is contained in, or derived\nfrom, “honoured writings” or “honoured sheets” (ṣuḥuf mukarramah) that are “elevated”\nand “purified” and located in the hands of noble “scribes” (safarah)—in short, that Mu-\nhammad’s revelations are descended from a celestial scriptural archetype to which only\nangels have access. The rec ord book or books utilised and “spread out” at the last judge-\nment, too, are called ṣuḥuf, which might simply be rendered “sheets of writing” in this\ncontext (Q 81:10: wa-i dhā l- ṣuḥufu nushirat). Fi nally, in one early Meccan passage the\nQur’an’s adversaries are accused of requesting “sheets of writing spread out” (Q 74:52:\nbal yurīdu kullu mriʾin minhum an yuʾtā ṣuḥufan munashsharah). This may reflect that\nMuhammad’s opponents demanded textual proof for the sort of claim put forward in\nQ 87:18–19 that “this”— namely, the content of Muhammad’s revelatory preaching—“ is in\nthe ancient writings.” Alternatively, the opponents to which Q 74:52 alludes w ere demand-\ning to witness the fulfilment of the prophecy made in Q 81:10 that at the eschatological\njudgement rec ord books would be “spread out” (see under → ˻asāṭīr al-a wwalīn).18 In\nthe later Meccan surahs, the word ṣuḥuf falls into desuetude, the only exceptions being\nQ 20:133 (referring to al- ṣuḥuf al- ūlā) and 98:2 (referring to Muhammad’s recitation of\n“purified ṣuḥuf”). Both passages are almost certainly echoes or quotations of the early\nMeccan verses Q 87:18, which has al- ṣuḥuf al- ūlā, and of 80:13–14, which combines ṣuḥuf\nand muṭahharah (cf. Goudarzi 2018, 308–309).\n17 This is not to overlook that certain aspects of the Qur’anic Abraham narratives, for instance, have parallels\nin the Apocalpyse of Abraham (see, e.g., Sinai, forthcoming b).\n18 A further option, suggested to me by Mohsen Goudarzi, is that the opponents demanded that Muhammad\n“bring down” a physical book from heaven, a polemical challenge quoted in Q 17:93.\n598 kitāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:621", "title": "Page 621", "locator": "pdf_page:621", "text": "Another term first appearing in the early Meccan period that can convey the approx-\nimate sense of “scripture” is the plural zubur. Like the consonantal roots ṣ-ḥ - f and k- t- b,\nthe root z- b- r expresses the idea of writing, and the basic meaning of the singular → zabūr\nis a piece of writing or a writ. Qur’anic occurrences of zabūr and zubur are reviewed in\nmore detail in a separate entry, but in the pre sent context two early Meccan instances of\nzubur deserve to be noted. First, in Q 54:52 the word conveys the idea of a divine rec ord\nbook: “Every thing they have done is documented in written rec ords” (wa- kullu shayʾin\nfaʿalūhu fī l- zubur). This use of zubur parallels that of kitāb in Q 78:29 (wa- kulla- shayʾin\naḥṣaynāhu kitābā, “We have enumerated every thing in a written rec ord”). Secondly,\nQ 26:196 announces that what Muhammad preaches is “in the writings of the ancients”\n(wa- innahu la- fī zuburi l- awwalīn). This is evidently the same claim that Q 87:18–19 makes\nby using al-ṣ uḥuf al-ū lā instead of zubur al-a wwalīn. Interestingly, the following verse,\nQ 26:197, then adds the rhetorical question, “Was it not a sign for them that the learned\nones among the Israelites (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl) know it?” It seems that learned Israelites— i.e.,\nIsraelites/Jews who are textually versed— are assumed to be in a position to confirm that\nthe Qur’anic revelations are paralleled by the ancient writings mentioned in Q 26:196 (cf.\n53:36–37 and 87:18–19 as well as the l ater Meccan verse 20:133) or perhaps even that the\nQur’anic revelations are announced by them (cf. the latter passage Q 7:157). Assuming that\nthe primary canon of Jews, what ever their par tic u lar confessional profile, is the Hebrew\nBible, Q 26:197’s reference to what appear to be con temporary Israelites is compatible\nwith the view that the ancient writings mentioned in Q 26:196 and 87:18–19 allude to the\nBiblical scriptures rather than to a separate corpus of apocalyptic lit er a ture (even if it is\nadmittedly difficult to say anything certain about the composition of the scriptural canon\nof the “learned Israelites”).\nConcluding observations on the lexicon of the early Meccan surahs and their rela-\ntionship to the rest of the Qur’an. Overall, the early Meccan employment of ṣuḥuf and\nzubur just examined discloses an int er est ing dialectic of continuity and discontinuity in\nrelation to chronologically l ater portions of the Qur’an. On the one hand, the early Meccan\nsurahs unmistakably evince the three pivotal components that inform the general under-\nstanding of scripturality found throughout the Qur’an, namely: the notion of a celestial\nrec ord book, the derivation of the Qur’anic revelations from a transcendent archetype,\nand the claim that the Qur’anic proclamations are continuous with an e arlier body of scrip-\ntural revelations. Th ere is thus significant thematic continuity in the Qur’anic concept of\nscripture from the early Meccan period onwards. On the other hand, in articulating these\nideas the early Meccan surahs show a noticeably wider degree of terminological variance\nthan later Meccan and Medinan texts, which almost always prefer the term kitāb over\nṣuḥuf or zubur, while the singular of zubur, zabūr, becomes more narrowly associated\nwith David and the Psalms (see, e.g., Q 17:55 and 21:105) and ceases to apply to the tran-\nscendent register that it evokes in the early Meccan verse Q 54:52 (see under → zabūr). A\nsimilar observation may be made apropos of the singular use of the noun lawḥ, “tablet,”\nin Q 85:22 in order to designate ostensibly the same entity— namely, a heavenly archetype\nof the Qur’anic proclamations— for which subsequent revelations standardly employ the\nword kitāb: whereas the wording in Q 85:22 is still strongly suggestive of some connection\nwith the heavenly tablets from Jubilees (see above), chronologically later Qur’anic proc-\nlamations clothe the same basic conception in diction that is more distinctively Qur’anic,\nthus obscuring the likely genealogical link.\nkitāb 599", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In support\nof the latter observation, one may note further expressions that are by and large limited\nto early Meccan surahs, namely, dīn in the sense of “judgement” (→ dīn1), references to\n“the name of yourS Lord,” ism rabbika (→ ism), and use of → ṣaddaqa bi- , “to believe\nin,” in lieu of → āmana bi- , which becomes the habitual choice in later surahs. Lexical\ndiscontinuity between the early Meccan surahs and the rest of the Qur’anic corpus might\ngive rise to the hypothesis that the early Meccan ensemble of texts, or some portion of\nit, has a dif er ent author than the remainder of the Islamic scripture, a proposal recently\nmade by Tommaso Tesei (Tesei 2021). But notwithstanding Tesei’s confidence in the\nmatter, it is far from clear which amount of terminological, stylistic, and even doctrinal\nchange would be incompatible with single authorship; the manner in which historians\nof philosophy are wont to distinguish the early Wittgenstein from the late one certainly\ngives pause in this regard. One must also not lose sight of the fact that the lexical discon-\ntinuity between the early Meccan surahs and the rest of the Qur’an is far from total; for\nexample, we saw above that the term kitāb is not absent from early Meccan texts (Q 52:2,\n56:77–78, 78:29), and other key Qur’anic terms, such as the noun qurʾān, are likewise\nattested already in the early Meccan corpus (e.g., Q 56:77, 73:4, 75:17–18, 84:21, 85:21).\nMoreover, even a characteristically early Meccan expressions such as ṣaddaqa bi- , “to\nbelieve in,” has isolated recurrences outside the early Meccan corpus (Q 39:33, 66:12),\nand an equivalent observation holds for the plural ṣuḥuf (see above) and for → zabūr and\nits plural zubur (e.g., Q 17:55, 23:53).\nHowever one stands on the question of single authorship, t here is accordingly good\nreason to assume that the early Meccan surahs were the starting point out of which the\nrest of the Islamic scripture developed. This explains both why terminology that comes\nto be dominant in later periods of the Qur’an can already have a nascent presence in the\nearly Meccan proclamations and why distinctively early Meccan language can make an\noccasional comeback in later surahs. Specifically with regard to the topic of the pre sent\nentry, such a developmental scenario yields an eminently plausible evolutionary movement\nfrom lexical variance to greater lexical standardisation (notably, from the concurrent use\nof kitāb, ṣuḥuf, and zubur to an almost exclusive use of kitāb alone). The early Meccan\nsurahs, then, permit us to catch sight of the starting point of a pro cess of terminological\nstandardisation that unfolded over the course of the Qur’an’s genesis.19\nThe observations made in the course of this section also illustrate the difficulties faced\nby the principal alternative to an evolutionary scenario of the Qur’an’s origin, namely,\nby a documentary hypothesis according to which dif er ent parts of the Qur’an— e.g., dif-\nfer ent groups of surahs— originated as separate collections that w ere only at a l ater point\ncompiled into a unitary scriptural corpus. I take it that in order to be entitled to posit\nsuch in de pen dent source documents, the latter would need to be characterised by a high\n19 Whether and in what regard such lexical standardisation is connected with similar developments in the\ndoctrinal domain is a separate question. The Qur’an’s basic scripturology certainly seems fairly consistent between\nthe early Meccan and later surahs, despite the terminological developments just noted. But there may well be\nsignificant developments in other branches of Qur’anic theology. Note, for example, that the early Meccan verse\nQ 53:13 might be understood to evoke a “descent” (nazlah) of the deity itself (see under → nazzala), which has\nno parallels in later portions of the Qur’an.\n600 kitāb", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

However,\nthis is only partially what one finds when examining the Qur’an in concrete detail. To be\nsure, it is certainly feasible to specify vario us stylistic, lexical, and doctrinal characteristics\nthat by and large converge to partition the Qur’anic corpus into a number of palpably more\nhomogeneous surah clusters, for which conventional scholarship employs such labels as\n“early Meccan” or “Medinan.”20 Yet it is equally striking that Qur’anic surahs also exhibit\nmany stylistic, phraseological, and theological features that are common to more than one\nsuch textual class, albeit perhaps at dif ere nt frequencies (e.g., Sinai 2015–2016, 73–74). The\noccasional reappearance of → ṣaddaqa bi-, “to believe in,” outside the early Meccan surahs\nis one example for this. Another randomly chosen illustration is provided by formulaic\nstatements that God is “a bestower of favour (faḍl) upon the people” but that “most” of\nthem “are not grateful” (Q 2:243, 10:60, 27:73, 40:61: inna llāha/rabbaka la- dhū faḍlin ʿalā\nl-n āsi wa-l ākinna aktharahum / akthara l-n āsi lā yashkurūn; cf. 12:38 and see Bannister\n2014, 220–221).21 The formula is mostly later Meccan but has one Medinan occurrence in\nSurah 2, thus spanning the Meccan- Medinan divide that is nonetheless a well- established\ntaxonomic line across the Qur’an.

From a diachronic perspective, the t hings that are dismissed\nas a lie in the early Meccan surahs are God’s post- resurrection judgement, paradise, and\ndivine punishment in general (e.g., Q 69:4, 82:9, 83:11, 92:9, 107:3), but also the manifold\nfavours or blessings that God has bestowed on humans (Q 55:13.16.18 etc.) and God’s signs\n(Q 54:42, 78:28; → āyah). Especially the accusation of dismissing God’s signs as a lie con-\ntinues to be frequent in chronologically later Meccan and Medinan verses (e.g., Q 2:39,\n3:11, 5:10.86, 6:21.27.39 etc., 7:36.37.40 etc., 8:54, 10:17.73.95, 17:59, 21:77). As illustrated\nby Q 75:31–32 and 92:6.9 (wa- ṣaddaqa/wa-k adhdhaba bi-l - ḥusnā, “he held the fairest\n[reward] to be true” or “dismissed it as a lie”), the initial antonym of kadhdhaba bi- in\nthe Qur’an is → ṣaddaqa bi- , “to hold s.th. true, to declare s.th. to be true.” However, in\nlater Meccan and Medinan texts the predominant term for an individual’s commitment\nto core religious truths comes to be not ṣaddaqa bi- but → āmana bi- , “to believe in s.th.”\nIn so far as kadhdhaba bi- is opposed to āmana bi- , it has considerable semantic overlap\nwith → kafara bi-, “to repudiate s.th.”\nBiblical precursors. The Qur’anic notion of dismissing a divinely sent warner as\na liar has a close parallel in Ephrem’s sermon on Jonah and Nineveh, where the king\nof Nineveh addresses his people with the words (Beck 1970b, no. 1:731–732): “Who\nwould call a prophet proclaiming [God’s] punitive wrath (rūgzā) a liar (daggālā)?”\nThe king’s question evokes the New Testamental concept of “lying prophets” or “false\nprophets” (Greek singular: pseudoprophētēs, rendered in the Peshitta as nbīyā daggālā,\nnbīyā d-d aggālūtā, or nbīyā d-k addābūtā), of whom Jesus warns in Mat 7:15 and whose\nappearance at the end of the world he predicts in Matt 24:11.24 (see also Mark 13:22,\nLuke 6:26, Acts 13:6, 2 Pet 2:1, 1 John 4:1, as well as Rev 16:13, 19:20, and 20:10). Anxiety\nabout false prophets, of course, goes back to the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Jer 23:9–40, Ezek\n13). Thus, when the Qur’an pre sents Muhammad or his message as objects of the verb\nkadhdhaba, the weight of the accusation is perhaps not merely that Muhammad is not\nbeing believed but rather that he is being rejected as a pseudoprophet in the Biblical\nsense, with all its concomitant undertones of vigorous moral condemnation: pseudo-\nprophets, after all, are not simply unreliable but are likened to “ravenous wolves” in\n“sheep’s clothing” (Matt 7:15). It must be added that this is not necessarily to say that\nMuhammad’s opponents themselves understood him to be a pseudoprophet along\nBiblical lines, only that the Qur’anic proclamations polemically cast their opponents\nas perversely mistaking God’s chosen warner for the polar opposite.\nkursiyy | throne\n→ malik\n1 See also Q 95:7, which is more difficult to parse (Birkeland 212–216; PP 189–190).

A particularly\nobvious one is Q 2:267 (“O believers, spend some of the good things you have acquired,”\nyā- ayyuhā lladhīna āmanū anfiqū min ṭayyibāti mā kasabtum), but the same interpretation\nmay also be valid for Qur’anic assertions that the sinners will not benefit (mā aghnā\nʿanhum / lā yughnī ʿanhu) from “what they have acquired” (mā kānū yaksibūn / mā kasabū /\nmā kasaba; see Q 15:84, 39:50, 40:82, 45:10, 111:2; Torrey 1892, 28).\nThe Qur’anic use of kasaba and iktasaba generally displays a very marked predominance\nof nominalised relative clauses such as mā yaksibūn (Q 2:79), mā kānū yaksibūn (e.g.,\nQ 6:129, 7:96, 9:82.95, 83:14), mā kasabū (e.g., Q 2:202.264, 3:155, 4:88, 6:70, 42:34), or\nmā kasabat / mā ktasabat (e.g., with → nafs as the grammatical subject, as in Q 2:281.286,\n3:25.161, 6:70, 52:21, 74:38, among others). The fact that such formulations do not explic itly\nspecify what is being “acquired” creates some ambiguity as to the nature of the object in\nquestion. This opens up space for a unitary translation of kasaba or iktasaba as referring\nto the acquisition of some this-w orldly or other-w orldly benefit that is entailed by an indi-\nvidual’s action. Thus, Boneschi would, for instance, render waylun lahum mimmā yaksibūn\nin Q 2:79 along the lines of “Woe to them on account of what they have accumulated [in\nterms of worldly profit]!” (Boneschi 1955, 24). But t here is good reason to assume that in\ncases in which kasaba and iktasaba do not obviously relate to the acquisition of material\ngoods, as in Q 2:267, their objects are in fact actions rather than the benefits resulting\nfrom these actions (Bravmann 1972, 112–113). This is most compellingly shown by a small\nnumber of verses in which kasaba or iktasaba do figure with an explicit object that clearly\nsignifies an action, as in Q 4:111, 6:120, and 24:11, where the object is ithm, “sin, misdeed,”\n1 Given that Q 2:286 uses kasaba and iktasaba directly in parallel, the two verbs are reasonably considered\nto be synonymous (Torrey 1892, 29).\nkasaba, iktasaba 603", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, a short poem by al-A ʿshā describes somebody courageously preparing for\nbattle as “leaving of bad acquisition” (al- tāriku l- kasba l- khabītha; Ḥusayn 1983, no. 71:4).3\nBravmann contends that by “acquiring” heroic deeds, the pre- Islamic hero contributes to\nbuilding a “heritage of glory” that is passed on to the next generation, to be cultivated and\naugmented further (Bravmann 1972, 104–106).\nBravmann’s claim that the Qur’an’s pervasive use of kasaba and iktasaba with actions\nas their objects is related to a pre-I slamic understanding “that actions represent the pos-\nsessions of the acting person” (Bravmann 1972, 113) is persuasive. At the same time, the\nexpression may be considered part and parcel of the system of “commercial-t heological”\nconcepts pervading the Qur’an (Torrey 1892; → ajr, → ḥisāb, → sharā, → aqraḍa, and cf.\nQ 2:16 and Mark 8:36). If one recognises that the Qur’an shares such meta phors with e arlier\nmono thei stic traditions (Rippin 1996, 133; see also Anderson 2009), the Qur’an’s recourse\nto the notion of righ teous action as acquisition recalls the New Testamental assertion\nthat accumulating a trea sury (thēsaurizō) in heaven is superior to gathering earthly riches\n(Matt 6:19–21; see also Luke 12:33–34; for a more extensive analy sis, refer to Anderson\n2013, 123–126). By performing right eous or evil actions, h umans accrue positive or neg-\native entries in their moral ledgers with God that will yield eschatological (or, in some\ncase, earthly) recompense (similarly KK 22), as expressed by a relatively g reat number of\nverses collocating kasaba or iktasaba with derivatives of j- z- y— namely, the verb jazā, “to\nrequite, to recompense,” and the noun jazāʾ, “recompense, requital” (e.g., Q 5:38, 6:120,\n9:95, 10:27.52, 45:14.22)—or with → waffā, “to pay s.th. to s.o. in full, to repay s.o. for s.th.\nin full” (Q 2:281, 3:25.161). Rendering kasaba and iktasaba as “to accrue” permits a unitary\ntranslation regardless of whether reference is to the acquisition of material goods, on the\none hand, or the per for mance of actions that are subject to moral valuation and therefore\nto eschatological reward and punishment, on the other.\nkashafa tr. | to lift or remove s.th.\n→ rijz/rujz, → ʿadhdhaba\nkawāʿib pl. | maidens full of bosom\n→ ḥūr\n2 One might of course try to argue that sayyiʾ and khayr are sufficiently unspecific to refer to unwelcome or\nwelcome outcomes; but it seems preferable to construe these verses along the lines of Q 4:111.112.\n3 Bravmann also adduces Lyall 1918–1924, no. 54:25, where Bravmann argues kasb al- khanā is equivalent to\nal- kasb al- khabīth, and DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 5:8.\n604 kashafa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Ṭab. 1:262), which subsequently developed into the meaning “to be ungrateful for\ns.th.” or, if used without an object, simply “to be ungrateful” (ERCQ 119–120; AEL 2620;\nUllmann 1970, 261–268). The sense of ingratitude is attested in early poetry (e.g., DSAAP,\nʿAntarah, nos 8:3 and 21:68; Lyall 1918–1924, no. 5:7, cited in KU 59–60; see also GMK\n232) and is still operative in some Qur’anic occurrences. For example, Q 21:94 announces\nthat a believers’ eforts “ will not be met by ingratitude” (fa- lā kufrāna li- saʿyihi), and 3:115\nsays with re spect to believing and righ teous members of the scripture- owners (→ ˻ahl\nal- kitāb) that “they w ill not be treated ungratefully” by God for the good they have done\nduring their earthly lives (wa-m ā yafʿalū min khayrin fa- lan yukfarūhu). Interestingly,\nsuch an eschatologically tinged use of kafara + acc. in the sense of “to treat s.o. with in-\ngratitude” has a close parallel in a verse by the Christian poet ʿAdī ibn Zayd, who evokes\na “day on which a servant [of God] will not be treated ungratefully for what he has stored\nup” (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 8:17: yawma lā yukfaru ʿabdun mā ddakhkhar). Other Qur’anic\ninstances in which k- f- r conveys ingratitude are Q 27:40 and 76:3, which oppose kafara\nor the adjective kafūr to shakara, “to be grateful,” or shākir, “grateful” (similarly Q 2:152,\n14:7, 16:112, 21:94, 26:19, and 31:12; see KU 60 and ERCQ 120–124).\nKafara as the antonym of āmana, “to believe.” In many cases, however, the Qur’an\nemploys the verb kafara as an antonym of → āmana, “to believe,” rather than of shakara\nkafara 605", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This second meaning is particularly prevalent\nwhere kafara takes a prepositional object introduced by bi- rather than an accusative ob-\nject. To be sure, it is not a priori impossible that kafara bi- with God as its oblique object\n(Q 2:28, 4:150, 16:106, 67:6) might mean “to be ungrateful to God.” Yet in phrases like\nkafara bi- āyāti llāhi (e.g., Q 2:61, 3:4.19), kafara can hardly signify anything other than “to\nreject, to disbelieve,”1 and this conclusion is even more obvious for verses which oppose\nkafara to āmana (e.g., Q 2:26.85.91.121).2 Moreover, t here are Qur’anic passages that c ouple\nkafara with the verb → kadhdhaba bi- , “to dismiss s.th. as a lie, to dismiss s.o. as a liar”—\nthe objects of such dismissal being God’s signs (singular: → āyah), the day of judgement,\nor God’s messengers (Q 2:39, 5:10.86, 9:90, 22:44.57, 23:33, 29:68, 30:16, 39:32.59, 57:19,\n64:10, 84:20–22, 85:19; see Waldman 1968, 444–445). Th ese passages further establish\nthat kafara expresses an attitude of denial and disavowal.\nThe pre sent work translates kafara in this second sense as “to repudiate,” in order to\nreflect the fact that it is not simply derived from its antonym āmana by means of a negat-\ning prefix, as the En glish verb “to disbelieve” is negatively derived from “to believe.”3 “To\nrepudiate” also brings out the performative valence that kafara can clearly have, as shown\nby Q 40:84: when God’s punitive might w ill fin ally become manifest, t hose who previously\nrejected God’s messengers will expressly “repudiate” the beings they used to “associate”\nwith him (wa- kafarnā bi- mā kunnā bihi mushrikīn; see also Q 35:14). It should be noted\ndespite the general rule that kafara in the sense of “to repudiate” takes a prepositional\nobject in the Qur’an, there are a few instances in which kafara + acc., too, would seem to\nrefer to repudiation of God rather than ingratitude towards him. Two cases in point are\nQ 11:60.68, where quite a few translators feel that it is contextually more appropriate to\nunderstand inna ʿādan/thamūda kafarū rabbahum to mean “ ʿĀd/Thamūd repudiated [or\n‘disbelieved in’ etc.] their Lord” rather than “ʿĀd/Thamūd were ungrateful to their Lord”\n(Bell 1937, Arberry 1955, Jones 2007, Droge 2013, Zirker 2018). The same interpretation\nis plausible for Q 54:14, where Noah is described as man kāna kufir, “someone who was\nrepudiated.”4\n1 See also Q 2:90, where kafara takes the prepositional object bi-m ā anzala llāhu (“what God has sent\ndown”), which in the next verse (Q 2:91) as well as in 42:15 forms the prepositional object of āmana.\n2 This antonymy of kafara and āmana is also reflected in the so- called Constitution of Medina, where the\nparticiple kāfir figures as the opposite of muʾmin, “believer” (Lecker 2004, § 15).\n3 For instance, the conventional rendering of alladhīna kafarū as “the unbelievers, those who do not be-\nlieve” etc. runs into trou ble at Q 2:6, since it fails to signal that the under lying Arabic is not identical with the\nverse-c oncluding lā yuʾminūn, “they do/will not believe,” even though the two expressions are of course largely\nsynonymous. Regarding the choice of “to repudiate,” cf. al- Ṭabarī’s gloss of kufr with juḥūd at Ṭab. 1:262. See\nalso Smith 1991, 112, who remarks that kafara “means not to disbelieve but rather to reject: it too [like the verb\naslama, ‘to surrender oneself’] is active, engagé.”\n4 The verse may, however, involve a play on both meanings of kafara, in so far as it speaks of God’s recom-\npense (jazāʾ) li- man kāna kufir, perhaps conveying that God gratefully rewards Noah in contrast to the ungrateful\nrejection he sufered from his people. Al- Jallad notes that the extra- canonical prayer known as Sūrat al- Khalʿ\nalso employs kafara in the sense of “to repudiate” with a following accusative (Al- Jallad and Al- Manaser 2021,\n120): according to some sources, the third verse of this text runs wa- nuthnī ʿalaka wa- lā nakfuruka wa- nuʾminu\nbika, “We praise you and do not repudiate you and believe in you” (see Anthony 2019, 72). However, the\nfinal wa-n uʾminu bika is not pre sent in all attested versions of the prayer, and Anthony’s edition in fact omits\nit (presumably on the logic that both the preceding and the following verse each contain two verbs in the first\nperson plural, all of which govern a direct object rather than a prepositional one). Yet if the verse in question\nis confined to wa- nuthnī ʿalaka wa- lā nakfuruka, then the translation “We praise you and are not ungrateful to\nyou” is perfectly viable.\n606 kafara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

As we shall see below, this use of kafara is likely to be due\nto semantic interference with its Aramaic cognate. The development happened prior to\nthe Qur’an: a recently discovered Safaitic inscription contains the line h ʿsy nṣr- h m- kfr- k,\nwhich Al- Jallad argues means, “O Jesus [cf. Qur’anic ʿīsā], help him [namely, the author\nof the inscription] against those who deny you” (Al- Jallad and Al- Manaser 2021, 112). As\nAl- Jallad remarks, the fact that kfr here takes a direct object rather than a prepositional\none is noteworthy. It ties the inscription to Arabic kafara + acc., “to be ungrateful to s.o.”\n(e.g., Q 2:152: wa- shkurū lī wa- lā- takfurūn, “And thank me and do not be ungrateful to\nme”), while the invocation of Jesus makes it nonetheless quite plausible that the inscription\nemploys kfr to express a lack of belief rather than ingratitude. Although the precise terminus\nad quem of Safaitic epigraphy is unclear, the inscription indicates that the crucial step in\nthe semantic development of kafara from ingratitude to unbelief occurred well before the\nQur’an, and took place to the north of what was to become the Qur’an’s milieu of emergence.\nThe preceding observations establish that it is translationally appropriate to distinguish\ntwo broad senses of kafara, “to be ungrateful” and “to repudiate.” Nonetheless, the verb\nkafara should not be treated as a downright homonym. For the antonyms of each of the\ntwo meanings of kafara distinguished above— namely, shakara and āmana— are organically\nconjoined in Q 4:147 (see also 2:172): “Why should God punish you if you are grateful\nand believe?” Belief in God and gratitude towards him would appear to be intimately\ninterlinked, and the semantics of kafara should accordingly be understood to interweave\nthe cognitive aspect of repudiation or unbelief and the ethical one of ingratitude.5 This is\nconfirmed by Q 16:72, which combines the accusation of “believing in what is void” (a- fa-\nbi- l- bāṭili yuʾminūna) with that of being ungrateful for God’s grace (wa-b i-n iʿmati llāhi hum\nyakfurūn): while the prepositional object bi-n iʿmati llāhi (on which see under → anʿama)\nmakes it preferable to construe kafara in the sense of ingratitude h ere, the verb’s close\nproximity to āmana primes the recipient to think of repudiation and unbelief as well.\nHence, the phrase wa-b i-n iʿmati llāhi hum yakfurūn in Q 16:72 is perhaps best rendered in\na hybrid fashion, along the lines of “they ungratefully repudiate God’s grace.” Most likely,\nthe cognitive and ethical connotations of kafara are also si mul ta neously pre sent when\nthe Qur’an describes Iblīs as being “one of those guilty of kufr” (mina l- kāfirīn; Q 2:34,\n38:74): when Iblīs refuses to prostrate himself to God and instead “behaves haughtily”\n(istakbara), he clearly manifests a lack of proper gratitude t owards God but at the same\ntime also reveals himself to be the prototype of every one who subsequently “repudiates”\nGod. Thus, even when translating āmana and kafara as “to believe” and “to repudiate”\n(or more traditionally, “to disbelieve”) one must not understand this to entail that e ither\nword may be reduced to denoting purely intellectual acts of propositional assent and denial;\nrather, they encompass afective and actional dimensions as well (see Waldman 1968, 447 and\n453–454, and under → āmana). This is well illustrated by the semantic proximity between\n5 See the remarks in el Masri 2020, 9–10, insisting that the two broad senses of kafara, which he describes\nas “ethical” and as “epistemic,” are interlinked and may be viewed as jointly rooted in the verb’s supposedly basic\nsignificance of covering. However, I would take issue with his construal of Q 73:17 in this context, where yawman\nis more plausibly understood as the direct object of tattaqūn than of kafartum.\nkafara 607", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The occurrence of kafara bi- in the sense of “to\ndisbelieve in, to negate, to repudiate” corresponds neatly to Syriac kpar b- , which can also\nmean “to be ungrateful” (TS 1797–1798; SL 644–645). Thus, in a Syriac martyr text a Zoro-\nastrian convert to Chris tian ity is asked why he would “reject” or “repudiate” his ancestral\nreligion (Bedjan 1890–1897, 2:576, l. 6: da- b- dēn dīlan kpart; for the context, see Becker\n2009, 322). The link between Qur’anic kafara bi- and Syriac kpar b- was pointed out as\nearly as Jefery (FVQ 250), though the connection does not seem to have been registered\nby most scholars of the Qur’an.6 In rabbinic texts, too, Hebrew kāpar bә- and Aramaic\nkpar b- can signify a denial of religious truths (DTTM 661–662; DJBA 597). For example,\na liturgical poem in Jewish Palestinian Aramaic has its three protagonists— Shadrach,\nMeshach, and Abednego, whom King Nebuchadnezzar tried to force to worship a golden\nstatue according to Dan 3— declare, by way of a refrain, that “we w ill not repudiate” (anan\nla kaprin b-) the Mosaic commandment not to take other gods beside God (Sokolof and\nYahalom 1999, 120–124 = no. 13:8.16.24.32.40.48). Even though kafara is certainly a native\nArabic word, it consequently stands to reason that its Qur’anic use to refer to unbelief is\ndue to semantic interference by its Aramaic cognate. The same phenomenon is also en-\ncountered in the case of the kafara’s contrary → āmana, “to believe,” and is linguistically\nreferred to as a loanshift: semantic change u nder the impact of another language (Cole\n2019, 408, and Cole 2020, 616). Hence, and contrary to Izutsu, the employment of ka-\nfara to mean unbelief does not form an in de pen dent inner- Qur’anic development (GMK\n21–23).7 Whether the main impetus of the word’s semantic evolution is more likely to be\nJewish (KU 60) or Christian (FVQ 250) is difficult to decide with much certainty; it seems\nquite conceivable that its extension in meaning was spurred by convergent stimuli among\nArabophone Jews and Christians.\nIt is worth noting that the use of kafara = “to repudiate” with an accusative object that\nis attested by the Safaitic inscription discussed above as well as, prob ably, by Q 11:60.68\nand 54:14 suggests that the impact of Aramaic kpar on Arabic kafara may have unfolded\nin two stages. First, Arabic kafara was hitched to the notion of religious repudiation or\nunbelief that was an established sense of its Aramaic (or specifically Syriac) cognate. Sec-\nondly, where this newly available sense of Arabic kafara was at play, the verb’s syntax\nincreasingly came to replicate that of the Aramaic, or specifically Syriac, construction\nkpar b-. The emergence of the prepositional usage may also owe something to the fact that\nkadhdhaba = “to dismiss as a lie, to deny”—w hich the Qur’an joins with kafara as early as\nQ 84:22—l ikewise takes a prepositional object.

From this\nperspective, one would naturally translate absolute kafara as “to be an unbeliever” or “to\nbe a repudiator,” a strategy that is highly plausible, for instance, for Q 88:23 (“except for\nhim who turns away and repudiates,” illā man tawallā wa-k afar). This assumption has\nrecently been questioned in a carefully argued article (Cole 2020): while not disputing\nthe usual understanding of kafara bi- , Cole proposes that simple kafara and its participle\nkāfir can express a range of dif er ent meanings that must be teased out by contextual\nanaly sis.

Rendering simple kafara as “to be a repudiator” does not generally\nproduce translations that are contextually inappropriate. Equating the meaning of simple\nkafara with kafara bi- is also supported by the parallel cases of → āmana bi- , “to believe\nin,” or → kadhdhaba bi- , “to dismiss as a lie,” both of which also occur in an absolute\nform (āmana, kadhdhaba) that is reasonably construed as an ellipsis of their full prep-\nositional version (see also under → aslama). Thus, when kadhdhaba occurs without a\nprepositional object, as in Q 92:16 or 96:13, this almost certainly stands in for kadhdhaba\nbi-l -d īn, “to dismiss the judgement as a lie” (e.g., Q 82:9, 107:1), or kadhdhaba bi-y awmi\nl-d īn, “to dismiss the day of judgement as a lie” (e.g., Q 83:11, 74:46), etc.\n“The repudiators” as a collective term. In the Qur’an, absolute occurrences of kafara\nfrequently, and again from an early point in time, take the form of collective references\nto al- kāfirūn (e.g., Q 71:26, 74:10, 76:4, 86:17), al- kuffār (e.g., Q 13:42, 57:20,8 83:34.36),\nand alladhīna kafarū (e.g., Q 84:22, 85:19, 88:23, 90:19), all of which may be rendered\nsynonymously as “the repudiators” (Reuschel 1996, 143–156).9 These repudiators form\nthe communal opposite to “the God- fearing” (al- muttaqūn; → ittaqā) and “the believers”\n(alladhīna āmanū, al- muʾminūn; → āmana). In line with the semantic influence of Syriac\non Arabic kafara, the active participle kāfir and its plurals in Qur’anic Arabic act as ap-\nproximate equivalents of Syriac kāporā (plural kāporē), “infidel, pagan, apostate” and also\n“ingrate” (TS 1800; SL 642), and perhaps also of Hebrew kôpēr (KU 60; DTTM 661). For\nexample, when Ephrem, in his Hymns against Heresies, announces his intention to confute\n“the repudiators” (kāporē; Beck 1957b, no. 3:1), the similarity to Qur’anic polemics against\nthe kāfirūn is palpable.\nThe Qur’anic category of the “repudiators” is reasonably viewed as co- extensive with\nthat of the “associators” (al- mushrikūn, alladhīna ashrakū; → ashraka), a group of pagan\n8 In this verse, the plural al- kuffār is often glossed as meaning “farmers” (Cole 2020, 619; Galadari 2022,\n41). However, I can see no compelling reason to deviate from the standard meaning “repudiators” at Q 57:20.\nTranslations that render the word as “unbelievers” in this verse include Bell 1937, Paret 2001, or Jones 2007. Given\nthat the standard meaning does not engender any incongruity, it ought to be retained.\n9 Q 80:42 has the plural al- kafarah.\nkafara 609", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This equivalence entails that “the repudiators” should not invariably or even\nprimarily be supposed to function as a general category encompassing anyone who falls\nshort of Qur’anic standards of correct belief. Rather, in many if not most instances, “the\nrepudiators” is a polemically coded way of picking out a par tic u lar group defined by spe-\ncific beliefs and rituals, the Meccan pagans, just as the contrary category of “the believ-\ners” usually refers to a par tic u lar community as well that is accordingly listed alongside\nthe Jews (→ al-y ahūd, alladhīna hādū) and the Christians (→ al-n aṣārā; e.g., Q 5:69).\nThe concreteness of the Qur’anic use of the label “repudiators,” which contrasts with\nEphrem’s more abstract employment, is also manifest in so far as the Qur’an normally treats\nthe “repudiators” as distinct from Jews and Christians, who are often grouped together\nas the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al-k itāb; e.g., Q 2:105.109, 3:64.65.69.70–72.75.98.99\netc.), “ those who were given the scripture” (alladhīna ūtu l-k itāba), or the like (e.g.,\nQ 2:101.121.144–146, 3:19.20.23.100 etc.).\nThe inherent generic force of the category of “the repudiators” does however sometimes\nreassert itself. This is the case in a small number of verses that speak of unbelieving scrip-\nturalists (Q 2:105, 59:2.11, 98:1.6; cf. 5:78 and 9:29, and see HCI 75, n. 55). H ere, repudiation\nor unbelief is envisaged as a general human phenomenon that may be found beyond the\nranks of the pagan Meccan associators and among self- professed adherents of prior divine\nrevelations. Nonetheless, being a Jew or a Christian does not per se identify someone as\na repudiator, for Q 2:62 and 5:69 clearly posit that t here may be Jews or Christians who\n“believe in God and the final day and do righ teous deeds” (see also under → aslama).\nThe “scripture- owners” thus occupy an ambiguous intermediate position on a spectrum\nreaching from “the believers” par excellence (namely, the Qur’anic community) to “the\nrepudiators” par excellence (namely, the pagan associators).\nkaffara tr. ʿan | to absolve s.o. of s.th.\nkaffārah | expiation, atonement\nFurther vocabulary discussed: ajr | wage t ajāwaza intr. ʿan | to overlook s.th. q iṣāṣ |\nretaliation ḥurum pl. | being in a state of ritual consecration fidyah | ransom,\ncompensation, redemption\nGod absolves (kaffara ʿan) the believers of their evil deeds. A recurrent Qur’anic trope\nstresses that God will “absolve” (kaffara ʿan) the believers or the God- fearing of their evil\ndeeds (sayyiʾāt). Such promises occur already in two Meccan passages, Q 29:7 and 39:35.1\n1 CQ 21–22 raises the possibility that the pre sent wording of Q 29:7 and 39:35 could be the result of Medinan\nrevision. The proposal implicitly rests on the assumption that the Qur’anic use of the verbal locution kaffara\nʿan, in view of its Hebrew background (see below), is most likely to have arisen in a Medinan context, marked\nby the Qur’anic believers’ encounter with a Jewish community. But even though the frequency of kaffara ʿan in\nMedinan surahs and its relative rarity in Meccan ones do give pause, at least Q 39:35 does not at first sight stand\nout as a potential addition. One might surmise that both Q 29:7 and 39:35 originally employed, not kaffara ʿan\nsayyiʾātihim, but tajāwaza ʿan sayyiʾātihim, “to overlook their evil deeds,” which is found in another Meccan\nverse, Q 46:16 (see below). This is however difficult to verify or falsify in any conclusive fashion. Although a\nmore detailed examination of the literary context of Q 29:7 and 39:35 would be welcome, it seems provisionally\nadvisable to avoid placing too much reliance on the presupposition that Jewish notions and traditions could only\nhave entered Qur’anic diction in the Medinan period.\n610 kaffara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Medinan surahs too reiterate\nfrequently that God will absolve the Qur’anic believers (Q 2:271, 3:193.195, 5:12.65, 8:29,\n47:2, 48:5, 64:9, 65:5, 66:8), or those who eschew major sins (Q 4:31: in tajtanibū kabāʾira\nmā tunhawna ʿanhu), of their wrongdoings.2 Also germane is the Meccan verse Q 46:16,\nwhich states that God will “accept” from the denizens of paradise “the best of what they\nhave done” (nataqabbalu ʿanhum aḥsana mā ʿamilū) and “overlook their evil deeds” (na-\ntajāwazu ʿan sayyiʾātihim). Instead of the formulation kaffara ʿan we here encounter\nthe ostensibly equivalent locution tajāwaza ʿan. Overall, the contextually appropriate\nrendering of kaffara ʿan is “to absolve” or perhaps more literally “to eface, to blot out,”\nbearing in mind that the Arabic root k-f -r may have conveyed the notion of concealment\nto the Qur’an’s addressees (→ kafara).\nQur’anic kaffara has been connected to the Biblical verb kipper (CQ 21–22 and FVQ\n250; see already BEḲ 90).3 Qur’anic kaffara is always employed with God as the gram-\nmatical subject, whereas its Biblical counterpart is often predicated of h uman individuals,\nsuch as Moses or a priest, in which case its meaning is “to make atonement” for someone\nor something (e.g., Exod 32:30 and Lev 15:15).4 It is this use of kipper that is operative in\nthe elaborate rituals of sacrificial atonement described in several Pentateuchal passages\n(TDOT 7:296–300). But there are also Biblical instances in which the agent of atonement\nis the deity himself, causing many translators to render kipper “to forgive” h ere (e.g., Ps\n64:4 and 78:38, Deut 21:8, and Ezek 16:63; see TDOT 7:300–301 and NIDOTTE 2:691).\nIt is noteworthy that the Peshitta does not translate such passages by a derivative of k- p- r\nbut instead tends to employ ḥassī, making Syriac an unlikely intermediary. A similar use of\nk- f- r, with God as the grammatical subject, is found in a Sabaic inscription (CIH, no. 539,\nll. 1: ykfrn ḥb-h mw, “he will forgive their sins”; see Mordtmann and Müller 1896, 287).\nWhat ever the precise discursive filiation, Qur’anic statements involving the verb kaffara\nconsistently underscore that it is God alone who leniently remits and disregards the sins of\nthose who have proven themselves to be committed believers; the Qur’an does not pre sent\nGod’s remission of h uman sins as consequent on par tic u lar acts of cultic atonement (an\nobservation also made in TDOT 7:289). Q 5:12, addressed to the Israelites, does identify\nper for mance of prayer, almsgiving, and belief in God’s messengers as preconditions for\nGod’s absolution or efacement of sins. But the net implication is still merely that divine\nabsolution is contingent upon the intactness of the Israelites’ general relationship to God,\nof which regular prayer and almsgiving are external manifestations.\nThe noun kaffārah. A somewhat dif ere nt emphasis emerges from three verses in Surah\n5, which employ the noun kaffārah, “expiation,” “atonement.” H ere, the Qur’an does appear\nto prescribe specific acts that will efect expiation for certain transgressions, at least two\nof which are of a ritual nature (breaking oaths, perhaps understood to have been sworn\n2 Specifically on the redemptive efficacy of almsgiving and charity, see under → ṣadaqah.\n3 On the Hebrew word, refer to HALOT 493–494, TDOT 7:288–303, and NIDOTTE 2:689–710.\n4 For an overview of the verb’s use with direct and prepositional objects, see TDOT 7:290–291.\nkaffara 611", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Even so, none of the stipulated\nacts of expiation themselves involve sacrifices or other cultic per for mances. Rather, they\nare all charitable in nature, with the exception of fasting, provided as an alternative for\nthose unable to aford other manners of atoning. Specifically:\n- If somebody foregoes retaliation (qiṣāṣ), it will be a kaffārah “for him” (Q 5:45). The\ntransgression that is thereby expiated is not identified (cf. also Q 4:92).\n- The kaffārah for broken oaths is specified to consist in feeding ten poor people, cloth-\ning them, freeing a slave, or, if the delinquent does not have sufficient means (fa- man\nlam yajid), a fast of three days (Q 5:89).\n- The ofence of intentionally killing game while being in a state of ritual consecration\nfor the pilgrimage (wa-a ntum ḥurumun) is to be compensated (fa-j azāʾun . . .) by\nequivalent livestock from the ofender’s property or by undertaking the kaffārah of\nfeeding the poor or fasting (Q 5:95).\nIt is therefore accurate to say that “kaffārah, in its ḳurʾānic conception, is obtained\nwithout the help of a blood sacrifice, unlike the levitical system, where the means of expi-\nation is usually blood” (Chelhod 1978, 407). Yet the Qur’anic noun kaffārah is nonetheless\nconvincingly identified as an Arabisation of rabbinic Hebrew kapparah (BEḲ 90; JPND\n220; FVQ 250; see also HCI 213–214, n. 89, and, on the noun kapparah, DTTM 662). The\nword accordingly constitutes one of vari ous pieces of circumstantial evidence revealing\nthat the Medinan Jews were familiar with at least some rabbinic concepts, traditions, and\npractices (→ al- yahūd). Assuming that the addressees of Surah 5 had first-h and exposure to\nJewish ritual, they may further have associated the Arabic word kaffārah with the Hebrew\nword kippur, used mainly in yom ha- kippurim, “the Day of Atonement,” especially given\nthat the latter is a fast- day and that both Q 5:89 and 5:95 mention fasting as a valid mode\nof ritual expiation. At the same time, the morphology of kaffārah may also owe something\nto the fact that in Arabic the noun pattern faʿʿālah can designate “an instrument . . . by\nmeans of which something is done, regularly and constantly” (Wright 1974, 1:176–177).\nThe term kaffārah would accordingly have connoted a means of expiating or atoning for\ncertain transgressions (a sense that in Q 2:184.196 is expressed by fidyah; cf. Q 37:107).\nTaken by themselves, Q 5:45.89.95 accentuate h uman rather than divine agency in achiev-\ning absolution for one’s lapses. Yet the Qur’an’s addressees would certainly have heard\nthe term kaffārah in Surah 5 against the background of the use of kaffara ʿan in earlier\nand cont emporary surahs, as outlined above. Hence, the focus on par tic u lar human acts\nof expiation for specific transgressions in Q 5:45.89.95 is complemented by the Qur’an’s\ngeneral stress on God as the agent of absolution or remittance of sins.\nAs intimated, there are additional passages in the Qur’an that stipulate expiatory pro-\ncedures similar to those described in Surah 5 (Q 2:184.196, 4:92, 58:3) but do not employ\nthe noun kaffārah. The rationale for the choice of the latter term in Surah 5 may well have\nbeen to function as an explicit signal that the Qur’an is articulating an understanding of\natonement contrasting with what was perceived to be the Jewish One.\nkufuw (variant of kufuʾ or kufʾ) | equal in rank\n→ allāh\n612 kufuw", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, laʿallakum tattaqūn in Q 2:21 is appropriately glossed as li- tattaqūhu or the like\n(thus Ṭab. 1:387), and En glish translators arguable o ught to render laʿalla in such cases as “so\nthat” (Jones 2005, 243–244; see also Retsö 2003, 43 and 59, n. 127, and Wild 2006b, 144).2 Al-\nṬabarī adduces a verse of poetry in support of such a consecutive usage of laʿalla, and in fact\nemployment of laʿalla in the sense of “so that” can also be seen in ancient Arabic poetry that\nis transmitted outside the literary genre of Qur’anic exegesis (EAP 1:130–131; Nöldeke 1863,\nno. 3:5). We are therefore confronted with an archaic feature of Qur’anic grammar h ere. Early\ninterpreters of the text w ere well aware of it, considering that equivalent glosses of laʿalla as\nli- kay, “so that,” are found already in the commentary of Muqātil ibn Sulaymān (e.g., Muqātil\n2002, 1:93, on Q 2:21, and ibid., 2:338, on Q 12:46).\nIt should be noted that in the vast majority of cases where laʿalla introduces a consecu-\ntive subordinate clause, it precedes a verse-fi nal verb in the second or third person plural\nof the imperfect (e.g., tattaqūn/yattaqūn, tashkurūn/yashkurūn, tahtadūn/yahtadūn). This\nsuggests that the Qur’an’s consistent verse- final preference for laʿalla + indicative over\nli- + subjunctive was in part motivated by the aim of maintaining a rhyme in - ūn (Jones\n2005, 243). This need not have been an instance of poetic licence (on which see Stewart\n2009) but could simply have been a matter of exercising preference among two linguisti-\ncally permissible and semantically equivalent constructions, only one of which produced\nthe desired verse-fi nal assonance. The situation is slightly complicated by a small number\nof verses that have wa- laʿallakum/-h um + verb in verse-fi nal position and in a context in\nwhich one might other wise have expected simple laʿallakum/- hum + verb, without pre-\nceding wa-. The clearest example is Q 7:174: “Thus do we expound the signs wa- laʿallahum\nyarjiʿūn.” Here, the presence of wa- would seem to have the consequence of turning what\ncould other wise have been parsed as a consecutive subordinate clause into a main clause.\nIf so, then laʿalla will need to be rendered as “perhaps,” its standard meaning when used\nto modify a main clause: “Thus do we expound the signs; perhaps they w ill return.” Alter-\nnatively, one might simply treat wa- as redundant (thus Droge 2013, 103).3\nVerse-fi nal laʿalla clauses often signal the kind of attitude that divine benefactions,\nrevelations, and signs (→ āyah) are meant to engender among their recipients, such as\nreflecting (laʿallakum tatafakkarūn, laʿallahum yatafakkarūn; e.g., Q 2:219.266, 7:176,\n16:44) and understanding (laʿallakum taʿqilūn; e.g., Q 2:73.242, 6:151, 12:2), fearing God\n(laʿallakum tattaqūn; apart from Q 2:21, see 2:63.179.183, 6:153, 7:171; → ittaqā) and being\nthankful to him (laʿallakum tashkurūn, laʿallahum yashkurūn; e.g., Q 2:52.56.185, 3:123,\n5:6.89, 14:37, 30:46, 45:12), heeding his hortatory reminders (laʿallakum tadhakkarūn,\nlaʿallahum yatadhakkarūn; e.g., Q 2:221, 14:25, 16:90, 28:43.46.51, 51:49; → dhakkara), or\n2 Jones is critical of the “ingenious eforts by some Arab grammarians and commentators to combine the\nmeaning ‘perhaps,’ with which they were perfectly familiar, with ‘so that,’ which was obsolete by the time they\nwrote.” However, it is not impossible that even where laʿalla introduces a consecutive clause, it might add a tinge\nof uncertainty or pessimism; see also below.\n3 Other verses have wa- laʿallakum/- hum + verb in the prefix conjugation immediately after a subordinate\nclause introduced by li-. Thus, Q 16:14, 28:73, 30:46, 35:12, and 45:12 all end in ±​<wa-> li- tabtaghū min faḍlihi\nwa-l aʿallakum tashkurūn, and see also 2:150.185, 7:63, 16:44, 40:67. In most of these cases, it is contextually\npos si ble that the conjunction wa- serves to coordinate laʿalla with the preceding li- clause, in which case a\nverse like Q 45:12 would mean “so that you might seek some of his favour and that you might be grateful” (thus,\nwith some diferences in diction, Droge 2013, 338). At Q 7:164 (qālū maʿdhiratan ilā rabbikum wa- laʿallahum\nyattaqūn), one might understand the laʿalla clause to be coordinated with the adverbial accusative maʿdhiratan\nand translate, with Droge: “They said, ‘As an excuse to your Lord and so that they might be God-f earing’ ” (Droge\n2013, 103; modified).\nlaʿalla 615", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Cognates of the Arabic word mathal are standard terms to refer to parables,\nsimilitudes, sayings, and proverbs in Hebrew (māšāl) and Aramaic (matla; HALOT 648;\nTDOT 9:64–67; DJBA 721; TS 2250–2251; SL 869; Buhl 1924a, 1–2).1 Like its cognates, the\nQur’anic term mathal has a considerable semantic range (Hirschfeld 1902, 83; Zahniser\n2004, 9). In Q 43:56, the word refers to a warning example, and a few verses on, in 43:59,\nit is said that God made Jesus a mathal for the Israelites, which may mean a positive exem-\nplar, in line with other verses that make similar statements about Abraham and Muham-\nmad (Q 2:124, 16:120, 33:21, 60:4.6, employing the terms imam, ummah, and uswah). In\nmany cases, however, the meaning of mathal is best captured by the En glish equivalents\n“similitude” or “likeness,” reflecting the fact that the Qur’an uses ka- mathali as a complex\npreposition in the sense of “like” (e.g., Q 57:20, 59:15.16). Thus, the famous “Light Verse”\nQ 24:35 explic itly introduces itself as putting forward a “similitude” (mathal) for God’s\nlight.2 Many Qur’anic amthāl (which are surveyed in Hirschfeld 1902, 83–97; Buhl 1924a;\nBEQ 426–438; Zahniser 2004) are concise comparisons or similes rather than narratively\narticulated parables. However, the latter are not absent e ither, as demonstrated by Q 18:32–44\nand 36:13–29 (on which see Buhl 1924a, 5–7; BEQ 433–434; Zahniser 2004, 10–11).3\nPhraseology. The noun mathal standardly figures as the accusative object of the verb\nḍaraba, literally, “to strike” ( Sister 1931, 115–116; Mir 1989, 207–208; CDKA 167–168).\nHowever, ḍaraba does not necessarily express the initial act of devising or inventing a\n1 On rabbinic parables see, e.g., Teugels 2019, including an extensive review of previous scholarship; on\nparables in the Gospels, see, e.g., Snodgrass 2018.\n2 As noted elsewhere (→ allāh), the fact that the Light Verse pre sents a similitude for God’s light does not\nimply that the verse’s opening claim that God is “the light of the heavens and the earth” is itself figurative.\n3 Zahniser also points to Q 68:17–34, which lacks the term mathal but nonetheless makes the relationship\nof historical correspondence explicit enough in v. 17 (“we put them to the test as we put to the test the owners\nof the garden”).\n617", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In view of this, it is preferable to render ḍaraba\nmathalan not as “to coin a similitude” but rather as “to put forward a similitude,” “to make\nuse of a similitude,” “to relate a similitude,” etc. The grammatical subject of ḍaraba math-\nalan is often God himself, but humans too can play this role (Q 2:26, 13:17, 14:24.25.45,\n16:74.75.76.112, 17:48, 18:32.45, 22:73, 24:35, 25:9.39, 29:43, 30:28.58, 36:13.78, 39:27.29,\n43:17.57, 47:3, 59:21, 66:1.11). Functionally, Qur’anic ḍaraba + mathal corresponds to rab-\nbinic mashlu (plural verb) + mashal (noun), “they put forward a parable” (see McArthur\nand Johnston 1990, 111).\nFrequent introductory formulae for Qur’anic similitudes are mathalu X ka- Y, lit-\nerally, “the likeness of X is as Y” (Q 10:24, 11:24, 14:18.26, 24:35, 48:29) or, involving a\nslight redundancy, mathalu X ka-m athali Y, “the likeness of X is as the likeness of Y”\n(Q 2:17.171.261.264.265, 3:59.117, 7:176, 29:41, 62:5; Sister 1931, 114–115). The two formulae\nare equivalent and can in most cases be rendered “A similitude for X is that it is like Y.”4 One\nmay note a distant resemblance to the first two components of the standard introductory\nformulae of rabbinic parables (see McArthur and Johnston 1990, 115–118), as illustrated by\nm. Sukkah 2:9: “[i] They put forward a parable (mashlu mashal). [ii] To what is the m atter\nsimilar?” The Qur’anic opening mathalu X resembles component (i) in identifying the\nliterary genre of the following, while Qur’anic ka-Y or its variant ka- mathali Y resemble\ncomponent (ii) in explic itly invoking the notion of similarity and comparability.\nMathal in the sense of “saying” or “characterisation.” Beyond the focal meaning of\na similitude, some Qur’anic verses apply the term mathal to a warning example of divine\npunishment or a paradigm of pious behaviour, or more generally a type (Buhl 1924a, 10;\ne.g., Q 14:45, 25:39, 43:56.57, 66:11). The word mathal h ere shows considerable referential\noverlap with other Qur’anic terms, such as āyah or ʿibrah (S ister 1931, 116). In such cases,\nthe word mathal still retains the connotation of a relationship or correspondence between\ntwo phenomena (for instance, between the believers and the wife of Phar aoh; Q 66:11),\nalthough the two relata are now located at dif ere nt moments of historical time rather than\nbeing taken from dif ere nt semantic domains, as in ordinary similes that might, for instance,\nconnect a religious claim to a natur al phenomenon (e.g., Q 2:261–262.264.265).\nSometimes, however, the word mathal does not appear to hinge on any comparative\nlink at all (Zahniser 2004, 9), e.g., in Q 47:3, where a contrastive statement about the re-\npudiators (who “follow what is vain”) and the believers (who “follow the truth”) is labelled\na mathal. In such instances, the term signifies nothing more than a pithy expression of\nthe essential character of a group or an individual, i.e., a saying or characterisation (Buhl\n1924a, 10–11). This is also the case for Q 16:60 (on which see also under → ism), which lays\ndown that “to those who do not believe in the hereafter belongs an evil characterisation\n(mathal al-s awʾ) and to God belongs the loftiest characterisation (li- llāhi l- mathalu l- aʿlā)”\n(cf. Q 30:27)— meaning, in slightly less clunky En glish, that the former are to be typified as\nwicked while of God one must only say the best. Similarly, a slightly later verse in the same\nsurah, Q 16:74, admonishes the addressees not to “relate amthāl for God” (fa-l ā taḍribū\n4 At Q 3:59 (inna mathala ʿīsā ʿinda llāhi ka- mathali ādama), it would be more idiomatic to translate simply\n“In relation to God, Jesus is like Adam,” since the verse holds that both were created in the same fashion, by\ndivine fiat.\n618 mathal", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Given that the previous two verses criticise those who are ungrateful\nfor God’s grace and venerate beings other than him (Q 16:72–73), Q 16:74 is likely not\ndiscounting the use of figurative or excessively anthropomorphic language with regard to\nGod (contrary to Hirschfeld 1902, 89–90) but is merely taking issue with the enunciation\nof theological claims that are deemed indefensible from the Qur’anic perspective (similarly\nBuhl 1924a, 11). Fi nally, Q 17:48 and 25:9 condemn the Qur’anic opponents on account\nof their recourse to “similitudes” or “sayings” (al- amthāl) for Muhammad, in both cases\nafter complaining about the opponents’ contention that he is “a man bewitched” (rajul\nmasḥūr). Amthāl that are not adduced by God, then, can simply be inadequate human\nattempts at conceptual categorisation. Here, too, the meaning of mathal is best glossed as\n“saying” or “characterisation.”\nThe discriminating effect of divine mathals according to Q 2:26, 29:43, and 74:31.\nThe Qur’an contains several explicit comments on God’s recourse to similitudes and its\ncommunicative purpose (e.g., Q 2:26, 14:25, 29:43, 30:58, 39:27, 74:31, 59:21; see BEQ 430).\nTwo verses quote the repudiators as asking, “What did God intend by employing this\n[namely, a preceding statement] as a mathal?” (mādhā arāda llāhu bi- hādhā mathalan),\nand then go on to highlight that by means of the mathal in question God will both guide\n(hadā) and lead astray (aḍalla; Q 2:26 and 74:31). In Q 2:26, the word mathal can be un-\nderstood to refer to a genuine similitude, since the preceding segment of the verse holds\nthat God is not ashamed to invoke “a gnat or what is above it.” This may allude to Qur’anic\ncomparisons involving a fly or a spider in Q 22:73 and 29:41 (KK 15). But no comparative\ndimension at all is pre sent in Q 74:31 (on which see also u nder → bayyana), since here the\nmathal at hand consists merely in the preceding statement, in 74:30, that the number of\nthe guardians of hell- fire is nineteen. The feature common to the use of mathal in Q 2:26\nand 74:31, therefore, is not the aspect of comparison, which is other wise fundamental\nto many Qur’anic occurrences of mathal, but rather the notion that a divine statement\nmay be purposefully designed to elicit dif er ent responses from believers and unbelievers\nand thus to discriminate between them (see under → balā).5 This idea is also pre sent in\nQ 29:43, according to which the similitudes (amthāl) related by God are understood “only\nby t hose who are knowledgeable,” although h ere, as in 2:26, the word mathal does involve\na comparative dimension as well, given that an earlier verse, 29:41, likens those serving\ndeities other than God to spiders weaving frail webs. As Buhl points out, the discriminating\nefect that a mathal has according to Q 2:26, 29:43, and 74:31 resembles the function that\nMark 4:11–12 and Matt 13:13–16 attribute to the parables of Jesus (Buhl 1924a, 3). It may\nbe submitted, therefore, that especially the non- comparative use of mathal in Q 74:31 is\nonly explicable by positing that the word mathal also served as the Arabic designation for\nNew Testamental parables.\ntamāthīl pl. | images\n→ ab\n5 By contrast, Buhl maintains that the sense of mathal at Q 74:31 is merely that of a description or char-\nacterisation (Buhl 1924a, 10). This is not impossible in view of occurrences like Q 16:74 and 47:3, referenced\nabove. However, it arguably fails to take into account the explicit comments on guidance and leading astray in\nQ 2:26 and 74:31.\ntamāthīl 619", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Both expressions are coupled\nin Q 8:49 and 33:12.60. Like the hypocrites, “ those in whose hearts is sickness” are, for\ninstance, accused of defeatism (Q 5:52) and an aversion to fighting (Q 47:20), suggesting\nthat the two expressions may to some degree be synonymous (thus also AHW 73). The sick\nof heart have a rancorous disposition, says Q 47:29, and other verses associate sickness of\nthe heart with being prone to succumbing to temptation and doubt (Q 22:53, 24:50, 74:31).\nIn Q 2:8–16, “t hose in whose hearts are sickness” are faulted for disingenuously professing\nbelief (Q 2:8.14) while also being criticised for openly defying the authority of the Qur’anic\nProphet (Q 2:13), remarkably in the same passage. This apparent tension, and the wide range\nof complaints made against the sick of heart more generally, prob ably reflects the fact that\n“the hypocrites” and “t hose in whose hearts is sickness” function as overspill categories for\nthose inhabitants of Medina who could neither be considered fully committed believers\nnor w ere readily identifiable as repudiators (alladhīna kafarū, al- kāfirūn, al- kuffār; → kafara)\nor associators (alladhīna ashrakū, al- mushrikūn; → ashraka).

Within the morphological structure of Arabic, masīḥ is formed like\na regular passive verbal adjective, such as qatīl, “killed,” with the corresponding first-f orm\nverb presumably being masaḥa bi-, “to wipe s.th.” (Q 4:43, 5:6, 38:33).2 Despite its potential\nsemantic analysability, however, the expression al- masīḥ appears to be l ittle more than a\n1 The most frequent version of Jesus’s name is ʿīsā bnu maryama (e.g., Q 2:87.253, 5:46.78.110.112.114.116).\n2 It is true that in the Qur’an masaḥa takes a prepositional rather than a direct object, while the passive\nmeaning of faʿīl adjectives is normally l imited to t hose derived from transitive verbs (Wright 1974, 1:136). But note\nthat AEL 2713 has masaḥahu, “to anoint s.o. or s.th. with oil.” Durie 2018, 161 maintains that “the form of masīḥ\ndoes not fit into any productive Arabic nominalization pattern,” but notwithstanding the foregoing qualifications\nthis is an overstatement.

The fact that al- masīḥ can be followed by the matronymic\n“son of Mary” without an intervening “Jesus” (see Q 5:17.72.75) further heightens the im-\npression that it behaves largely like an alternative proper name for Jesus; although al- masīḥ\nmay formally be described as a laqab or “descriptive epithet,” which “would normally have\na recognizable meaning” (Durie 2018, 161), there is no clear Qur’anic evidence to confirm\nthat the Qur’an’s addressees did in fact connect the title al- masīḥ with the verb masaḥa, “to\nwipe,” which is only employed in the context of regulating the ablutions to be performed\nbefore prayer (Q 4:43, 5:6).

Despite minor diferences in usage,1 the\ntwo words seem to be essentially synonymous, since both are said by the lexicographical\ntradition to signify recourse to ruses, guile, deceit, and artifice (AEL 2638–2639 and 2728).\nWhere makara and kāda are employed with a note of moral condemnation, they frequently\nrefer to actions that defy God or pose a threat to t hose believing in him. Examples are\nQ 10:21, speaking of makrun fī āyātinā, “scheming with re spect to (or against) our signs,”\nand the partial doublet Q 16:127 and 27:70, enjoining the Messenger not to be sad and\ndistressed in the face of the “scheming” of his opponents (mimmā yamkurūn).\nGod’s superiority over human cunning. Qur’anic references to human plotting often\nserve to make the point that God can and will bring to naught even the most devious\nhuman schemes, in the interest of protecting those who are faithful to him. Thus, Abra-\nham’s compatriots “devised a plot against him, yet we brought them low” (Q 21:70 and\n37:98: wa-/ fa-a rādū bihi kaydan fa- jaʿalnāhumu l-a sfalīn); Joseph prays to God to “avert”\nfrom him the guile of the Egyptian women to safeguard him from temptation (Q 12:33:\nwa-i llā taṣrif ʿannī kaydahunna), a plea that God fulfils (v. 34: fa-s tajāba lahu rabbuhu\nfa- ṣarafa ʿanhu kaydahunna); and God shields a pious anonymous Egyptian from un-\nspecified evil plots that were reportedly hatched by Pha raoh and his entourage (Q 40:45:\nfa-w aqāhu llāhu sayyiʾāti mā makarū). More generally, God “reduces to feebleness the\nrepudiators’ plotting” (Q 8:18: wa-a nna llāha mūhinu kaydi l- kāfirīn) and he “does not\nguide the plotting of those who are treacherous” (Q 12:52: wa-a nna llāha lā yahdī kayda\nl-k hāʾinīn). Similarly, God “led astray” the guileful plotting of the enigmatic “ owners of\nthe elephant” (Q 105:2: a-l am yajʿal kaydahum fī taḍlīl), which perhaps exemplifies the\ndivine protection under which other verses place the Meccan sanctuary (Q 28:57, 29:67).\nGod’s superiority over all human cunning is also underscored elsewhere: for instance,\nin Q 77:39 the divine speaker threatens “the deniers” (al-m ukadhdhibūn) with the day\nof judgement and then challenges them, “If you have any cunning devices left, then try\nto outwit me with them” (fa-in kāna lakum kaydun fa- kīdūn).2 Moreover, it is not only\nhuman cunning over which God is superior: Q 4:76 exhorts the believers to fight “the\nallies of the devil, for the dev il’s cunning is weak” (fa-q ātilū awliyāʾa l-s hayṭāni inna kayda\nl-s hayṭāni kāna ḍaʿīfā). The general motif of God’s superiority over human plotting and\ncunning is Biblical (e.g., Ps 2:1–6, 21:12–13).3\nDivine cunning. The verbs kāda and makara do not invariably imply moral condem-\nnation; as al-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī puts it, they fall into praiseworthy and blameworthy types\n(al- Rāghib al- Iṣfahānī 2009, 728 and 772). Thus, in Q 21:57 it is the stringent mono the-\nist Abraham who declares to his compatriots, “I shall outwit your idols” (la-a kīdanna\naṣnāmakum; note the recurrence of kayd in v. 70).

Other kīdūni/kīdūnī challenges occur in Q 7:195 and 11:55; they are\nuttered by human messengers rather than by God, yet the messengers’ confidence is of course predicated on\ntheir faith in divine assistance.

Thus,\nQ 7:99 asks whether “the inhabitants of the settlements” (ahl al-q urā) felt safe against\n“God’s scheming” (makr allāh), and in Q 12:76 the divine voice states that “we engaged in\nscheming on behalf of Joseph” (ka- dhālika kidnā li- yūsufa),4 an affirmation that concludes\nmultiple recurrences of the roots k-y -d and m-k -r throughout Surah 12 (for k-y -d , see also\nvv. 5, 28, 33, 34, 50, 52; for m-k -r , see vv. 31 and 102). Their overall efect is to highlight\nhow God’s plan will ultimately win out over all human intrigue (see Qureshi 2017, 165).\nTwo other verses characterising God in terms of the root k-y -d are the doublet Q 68:45\nand 7:183, according to which God is playing the long game in dealing with those denying\nhis signs or revelations: “I will grant them respite; my cunning is firm” (wa-u mlī lahum\ninna kaydī matīn).\nThe sense in which the Qur’an pre sents God as practising guile and artifice is best\nilluminated by a cluster of passages that refer to divine scheming as part of bipartite state-\nments in which a human ofence is followed by a divine response in kind.5 For example,\nin Q 86:15–16, the divine speaker ominously asserts that “they”— who in v. 17 turn out to\nbe the repudiators (al- kāfirūn)— “are engaged in scheming, // and so am I” (innahum\nyakīdūna kaydā // wa- akīdu kaydā), and a similar sequence is found in Q 52:42, even though\nthe divine response is here framed in the passive (am yurīdūna kaydan fa- lladhīna kafarū\nhumu l- makīdūn, “Or do they intend to have recourse to cunning schemes? It is the repu-\ndiators who will be cunningly outwitted”). Employing makara rather than kāda, Q 3:54\nsays about the Israelite adversaries of Jesus and his disciples that “they schemed and God\nschemed; and God is the most expert schemer” (wa- makarū wa- makara llāhu wa- llāhu\nkhayru l- mākirīn), while Q 8:30 applies a variant of the same formulation to con temporary\nrepudiators (wa- yamkurūna wa-y amkuru llāhu wa- llāhu khayru l-m ākirīn). Both verses are\nMedinan and echo the Meccan verse Q 27:50, reporting of certain members of the people\nof Thamūd, who planned a nocturnal assault on God’s messenger Ṣāliḥ (v. 49), that “they\nschemed and we schemed” (wa-m akarū makran wa-m akarnā makran); as v. 51 goes on to\nadd, “the outcome of their scheming” was that Thamūd were divinely obliterated. Other\nMeccan passages evincing the same sequence of human makr countered and outdone by\ndivine makr are Q 10:21, which accuses h umans of “scheming against our signs” (idhā lahum\nmakrun fī āyātinā) and then declares that “God schemes more swiftly” (quli llāhu asraʿu\nmakran), and Q 13:42 (wa- qad makara lladhīna min qablihim fa- li- llāhi l- makru jamīʿan,\n“t hose before them”— namely, before Muhammad’s audience—“ engaged in scheming, but\nall scheming belongs to God”).\nThe passages just rehearsed yield two impor tant observations. First, God’s recourse\nto guile and cunning is presented as a proportionate response to antecedent human\nmisdeeds. Contrary to what one might initially think, therefore, expressions such as\nmakr allāh, “God’s scheming” or “God’s cunning” (Q 7:99), do not give rise to prob lems\nof theodicy: God is merely portrayed as beating human schemers at their own game.6\nSecondly, and related to this, the context often makes it clear that God’s scheming is a\n4 Note the ambiguity of kāda li-, which in Q 12:5 means “to plot against s.o.,” as opposed to v. 76 (CDKA 243).\n5 In addition to the following material, see also under → nasiya for a similar sequence in which a negative\nhuman action entails a divine response in kind. See also Q 17:8 (wa-i n udtum ʿudnā). For a positive case of divine\nresponse in kind (if humans turn back to God in remorse, God will turn to them), see under → tāba.\n6 Unlike passages of the makarū-m akarnā type and its variants, Q 68:45 and 7:183 (“I w ill grant them respite;\nmy cunning is firm”) do not explic itly accuse God’s opponents of engaging in guileful plotting by applying to\n624 makara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, prior\nto the assertion that “all scheming belongs to God” (Q 13:42), the Qur’an underscores\nthat God’s judgement cannot be altered and that he is “quick to reckon” (v. 41: sarīʿu\nl- ḥisāb). Similarly, in the immediate vicinity of Q 10:21’s declaration that “God schemes\nmore swiftly” than humans we find a reminder that God’s “messengers” (rusul; singu-\nlar: → rasūl)— which must here designate angelic overseers— “write down the schemes\nyou hatch” (inna rusulanā yaktubūna mā tamkurūn). This suggests that God’s “scheming”\nis tantamount to the final judgement at which all human transgressions will be reviewed\nand duly avenged.\nThe fact that the Qur’an generally depicts divine guile and cunning as a proportionate\npunitive response to antecedent human misdemeanours is particularly in tere st ing in view\nof an allegedly pre- Islamic poem cited in the Kitāb al-A ghānī that bemoans how “the\ndeity (al- ilāh) targeted with his plotting (bi- kaydihi)” both the mythical people of Iram (on\nwhich see KU 89–90) and the poet’s own p eople (Abū l-F araj al-I ṣbahānī 1927–1974, 3:108,\nultimate line; Sinai 2019b, 37). However one judges the authenticity of the passage, it fits\nin with a wider trend in pre- Islamic poetry, according to which God (allāh or al- ilāh) is\nan ambivalent and occasionally destructive figure who can capriciously crush humans\nirrespective of any considerations of moral culpability, like the impersonal forces of fate\nor devestating time (al- dahr) with which Allāh is sometimes equated (Sinai 2019b, 33–39\nand 63). By contrast, the Qur’an stresses that God “does not inflict wrong on even a tiny\nspeck” (Q 4:40: inna llāha lā yaẓlimu mithqāla dharratin; cf. 21:47), and equivalent de-\nnials that God might do wrong are frequent (e.g., Q 3:108.117.182, 8:51, 9:70, 50:29; see\nunder → ẓalama). If indeed one can trust the poem just quoted to document that the\nnotions of divine plotting and scheming are pre- Qur’anic, then the Qur’an re orients them\nit in a manner consistent with its overall emphasis on divine justice.\nmakkana tr. fī, makkana intr. li-. . . fī | to establish s.o. on/in s.th., to give\ns.o. power over s.th.\nmakkana tr. li- | to establish s.th. for s.o.\nFurther vocabulary discussed: al-a rḍ | the earth; the land istaʿmara tr. fī l-a rḍ | to\nsettle s.o. on the earth askana ditr. | to let s.o. dwell somewhere bawwaʾa tr. fī l-\narḍ | to give s.o. an abode in the land / on earth istakhlafa tr.

The general trope of God’s establishment of\nhumans “on the earth” or “in the land” that he has created ties in with the Qur’an’s wider\npre sen ta tion of the earth, which is treated in detail elsewhere (→ arḍ).\nIt is pos sib le that makkana fī l- arḍ connotes a conferral of power and authority over the\nearth or a specific part of it (as put forward in CDKA 257–258). After all, Q 8:71 employs\nthe fourth- form verb amkana min to refer to God’s granting of power or superiority over\nthe believers’ foes.

At this point in the narrative, Joseph has been bought by an\nEgyptian master who contemplates adopting him and who orders his wife to “give him\na generous lodging” (akrimī mathwāhu). Although Joseph’s “establishment in the land”\nis surely indicative of his comfortable prospects in this verse, t here is no sense yet that\nhe has advanced, or might reasonably hope to advance, to a position of administrative or\npo liti cal influence in Egypt.\nmalaʾ | assembly; community leaders, notables\nal-malaʾ al- aʿlā | the assembly on high\nFurther vocabulary discussed: alladhīna kafarū, al- kāfirūn, al- kuffār pl. | the repudi-\nators m illah | religious teaching dhikr | ( hortatory) reminder, reminding exhorta-\ntion i stakbara intr. | to deem o.s. great, to behave haughtily i staḍʿafa tr. | to deem\nor treat s.o. as weak, to oppress s.o., to press s.o. hard mutraf | affluent a l- ardhalūn\npl. | the dregs (of society)\nAccording to the classical dictionaries, the noun malaʾ (on which see generally Chabbi\n2020, 549 and 621–622) means an assembly as well as the nobles or chiefs gathered in it\n(AEL 2729; al- Rāghib al- Iṣfahānī 2009, 776).

Ambros accordingly glosses the term as the “leading members of a\ncommunity, esp. (but not necessarily) when assembled for a po litic al purpose.” As Ambros\nnotes, Q 11:38 describes how members of the malaʾ of Noah’s people pass by him (kullamā\nmarra ʿalayhi malaʾun min qawmihi) while he is constructing the ark, that is, without a\nformal meeting being held (CDKA 258).\nQur’anic notables past and pres ent. Only one Qur’anic passage mentions the term malaʾ\nin connection with the Qur’an’s cont emporary unbelievers or “repudiators” (→ kafara). This\nis Q 38:6–8, according to which the repudiators’ notables (v. 6: al- malaʾ minhum, referring\nback to alladhīna kafarū / al- kāfirūn in vv. 2.4) urge their compatriots to remain steadfast to\ntheir gods (wa-ṣ birū ʿalā ālihatikum) and maintain that the Qur’anic Messenger’s mono the-\nistic preaching (cf. v. 5) is something unheard of “in cont emporary religious teaching” (v. 7:\nmā samiʿnā bi- hādhā fī l- millati l-ā khirati; → millah). According to v. 8, the same notables\nalso take ofence at the notion that it is the Qur’anic Messenger who should have been singled\nout among them (min bayninā) to receive and disseminate God’s reminding exhortation (al-\ndhikr; → dhakkara; see also Q 54:24, where a very similar objection is attributed to the tribe\nof Thamūd). The malaʾ at hand thus come across as invested in upholding the religious status\nquo and as contesting the Messenger’s claim to be specially endowed with divine authority,\nperhaps b ecause this threatened their own pre- eminence.\nOther wise, occurrences of the word malaʾ are limited to historical narratives: when\nNoah is sent to warn his people, their malaʾ or notables resist his preaching (Q 7:60,\n11:27.38, 23:24), and the same holds for the messengers Hūd (Q 7:66), Ṣāliḥ (Q 7:75),\nand Shuʿayb (Q 7:88.90). An anonymous messenger who is mentioned in Q 23:31–41 also\nencounters opposition from the notables of his people (v. 33). Notables are furthermore\nplaced in the comp any of rulers, whom they serve as councillors: Phar aoh confers with\nhis malaʾ when confronted by Moses (Q 7:103.109.127, 10:75.83.88, 11:97, 23:46, 26:34,\n28:20.32.38, 43:46); the Egyptian king in the story of Joseph too consults his notables\nabout the meaning of the dream that Joseph will go on to interpret for him (Q 12:43);\nand the queen of Sabaʾ seeks the advice of her notables regarding a letter that she has re-\nceived from Solomon (Q 27:29.32), while Solomon challenges his notables to bring him the\nqueen’s throne (Q 27:38). A link between a people’s malaʾ and the institution of kingship\nalso emerges from Q 2:246, which has the notables of the Israelites demand of “a prophet\nof theirs” that he appoint a king for them, a scene corresponding to the request that the\nIsraelite elders make of Samuel in 1 Sam 8:4–5.\nThe Qur’an tends to depict earthly notables in unequivocally negative terms, ar-\nticulating their hostility to vari ous messengers by means of the formulaic phrase “The\nrepudiating / haughty notables of his people said . . .” (Q 7:66.75.88.90, 11:27, 23:24:\nqāla l-m alaʾu lladhīna kafarū/stakbarū min qawmihi; 23:33: qāla l-m alaʾu min qawmihi\nlladhīna kafarū). Pha raoh and his notables are the grammatical subject of istakbara\n(“to deem o.s. great,” “to behave haughtily”) in two further verses (Q 10:75 and 23:46).\nThe notables figure virtually exclusively in scenes involving public speaking: they wield\npower through public oratory, or rather their elevated social status manifests itself in a\nprerogative to speak out. For example, the malaʾ are the grammatical subject of the verb\nqāla, “to say,” in Q 2:246, 7:60.66.75.88.90.109.127, 11:27, and 23:24.33.

Qur’anic references to no-\ntables tie in with other allusions to po liti cal, social, and economic stratification in the\ncommunities that the Qur’an reports to have been rebuked by divinely mandated warners.\nThus, Q 23:33 says that the notables opposing an anonymous messenger w ere granted a life\nof affluence (v. 33: atrafnāhum fī l-ḥ ayāti l- dunyā), and Q 7:75 recounts how the “haughty\nnotables” of the people of Ṣāliḥ (qāla l- malaʾu lladhīna stakbarū min qawmihi) speak to\n“ those who w ere oppressed, t hose who w ere believers among them” (li- lladhīna stuḍʿifū\nli- man āmana minhum) and question Ṣāliḥ’s God- given authority. Further occurrences of\nthe verbs istaḍʿafa (“to oppress”) and istakbara and of the descriptor mutraf, “affluent”\n(the passive participle of the verb atrafa that occurs in Q 23:33) as well as the disparaging\ncharacterisation of Noah’s followers as the “dregs” of society (Q 11:27: arādhilunā, 26:111:\nal- ardhalūn) by Noah’s people in general or, more specifically, by their notables (Q 11:27:\nal- malaʾu lladhīna kafarū min qawmihi) all contribute to establishing the theme of a tan-\ngible socio- economic diferential between those who oppose vari ous earlier messengers\nand those who follow them (see in more detail under → istaḍʿafa). Considering that the\nopponents of previous messengers transparently channel some of the main objections that\nwere encountered by the Qur’anic Messenger himself, it would appear legitimate to infer,\nespecially in view of Q 38:6–8, that the opposition to Muhammad’s preaching similarly\nemanated from Mecca’s po litic al and social elite and that an assembly of tribal chiefs called\nthe malaʾ was an actual institution in Muhammad’s Mecca (Lammens 1924, 74–75; Peters\n1994b, 16–17 and 417 with n. 47).\nThe heavenly assembly. Fi nally, just as the Qur’an portrays h uman rulers like Solomon\nas surrounded by their malaʾ, so it presuppose the existence of a heavenly or “highest”\nassembly, al- malaʾ al- aʿlā (Q 37:8, 38:69), who seem to include the angels to whom God\nannounces his intention to create h umans (Q 38:71; see also DTEK 84–86).2 This idea of a\nheavenly council or assembly has well- known Biblical pre ce dents (e.g., 1 Kgs 22:19–23, Ps\n82:1, and Job 1:6 f.) and goes back as far as Mesopotamian and Ugaritic lit er a ture (Smith\n2001, 41–53). The expression al- malaʾ al- aʿlā (“the assembly on high”) in par tic u lar has\nreminded scholars of the rabbinic term yeshibah shel maʿlah, the “acad emy on high” (Hor-\novitz 1919, 163; on the rabbinic notion, see EJ 1:353–354). However, unlike the rabbinic\ntradition the Qur’an does not suggest that the heavenly council is engaged in the study of\nscripture: given the inner- Qur’anic parallels, the heavenly council is to be understood as\nhaving a royal rather than scholarly ambience. A more pertinent Talmudic parallel, also\nreferenced by Horovitz, is therefore b. Sanh. 38b, citing Rabbi Yoḥanan’s dictum that God\n“does not act unless he consults (nimlak) with the members of the house hold on high\n(pamalya shel maʿlah).” On the protection of the heavenly council against eavesdropping\ndemons, see under → jinn and also → shayṭān.\n1 This is not universally the case; see Q 7:109 (and again in 7:127).\n2 Cf. the partially overlapping ways in which the angels phrase their objection to God’s creation of humans in\nQ 2:30 and in which Pha raoh’s notables press for action against Moses in 7:127. Eichler suggests that the heavenly\ncouncil may not be confined to angels, just as Solomon’s retinue included humans and jinn (Q 27:38–40) as well\nas, apparently, birds (Q 27:20–28; see DTEK 86).\n628 malaʾ", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The Qur’anic word malak, “angel” (plural: malāʾikah),1 corresponds to Hebrew\nmalʾāk, “messenger,” which the Septuagint renders by Greek angelos. In the Hebrew Bible\nand the New Testament, malʾāk and angelos designate not only superhuman agents on be-\nhalf of the deity (e.g., Gen 16:7 or Hos 12:5) but also human messengers commissioned by\nother humans (e.g., Gen 32:4, Job 1:14, or Luke 9:52; see DTEK 83). A Qur’anic malak, by\ncontrast, is invariably a super natural intermediary between God and h umans rather than\na “messenger” in a neutral functional sense, for which the Qur’an uses the words rasūl or\nmursal, applicable both to angelic messengers (as in Q 22:75 and 35:1) and to human ones\n(see under → rasūl and also Burge 2008, 52).\nIn addition to acting as emissaries, Qur’anic angels serve God in many other capaci-\nties that will be surveyed in the sections that follow, including as keepers of paradise and\nguardians of hell, as attendants on the day of eschatological judgement, and as overseers\ntasked with recording a human individual’s good and bad deeds.

Qur’anic angels remain almost always an anonymous col-\nlective (DTEK 85), although two passages cite the name of Gabriel, in one case together\nwith Michael (Q 2:97–98, 66:4),2 while another verse (Q 2:102) speaks of two Babylonian\nangels called Hārūt and Mārūt (see in more detail under → jinn).3\nThe Qur’an evidently presupposes considerable familiarity with Jewish and Christian\nangelological lore (on which see, e.g., Muehlberger 2013 and Ahuvia 2021). However, as will\nbe argued below, a distinctive—a lbeit not entirely unparalleled—t rait of Qur’anic angels\nconsists in the fact that unlike h umans and the jinn (→ jinn) they are not endowed with the\nability to disobey God’s orders, i.e., seem to lack free will: the Qur’an consistently depicts\nangels as mere instruments of God rather than as in de pen dent moral subjects confronted\nby a genuine choice between right and wrong. This contrasts with Jewish and Christian\nnarratives about angelic disobedience. Such stories include the tradition, based on Gen\n6:1–4, that prior to the Noachian flood lustful angels mated with human females, as re-\nported in 1 Enoch 6–9 (see generally Reed 2005 and concisely QP 183–193), and accounts\nof the primordial banishment of the erstwhile angel Satan due to his defiance of God (see\nRi 1987, Western manuscript group, ch. 3:1–7). Although the latter story is retold in the\nQur’an, the Islamic scripture recasts the devil as a demon or jinni (see u nder → shayṭān),\nmeaning that he no longer constitutes a case of properly angelic disobedience.\nEtymology. The word malak is widely considered to have its immediate precursor in\nClassical Ethiopic malʾak (plural malāʾәkt, resembling Arabic malāʾikah) in Western schol-\narship (NB 34; DTEK 83; FVQ 269–270; for an epigraphic attestation in a quotation of Ps\n35:5, see Robin 2019b, 124). An origin in Syriac malʾakā has also been suggested (Mingana\n1927, 85; see also CDKA 244). Against such extra-A rabic etymologies, Boneschi has vigor-\nously argued in favour of an inner- Arabic derivation of malak from maʾlak, itself derived\nfrom the root ʾ- l- k (Boneschi 1945). Maʾlak, he maintains, first became malʾak by metathesis\n(Boneschi 1945, 109) and then dropped its glottal stop altogether; and in line with some\nother words conforming to the morphological pattern mafʿal, Boneschi contends that the\noriginal meaning of maʾlak/malʾak would have been “something or someone sent,” i.e.,\nboth “message” and “messenger” (Boneschi 1945, 110). Even Boneschi, however, does not\ndispute that the fact that the word malak came to refer specifically to a celestial messenger\nis due to Judaeo- Christian influence (Boneschi 1945, 111). Somewhat similarly, Robin holds\nthat malʾak/malak is originally Arabic and then underwent semantic realignment leading\nfrom “messenger” in general to “angel” in par tic u lar (Robin 2019b, 122–124).\nEthiopic malʾak and also Syriac malʾakā, like their Hebrew and Greek equivalents but\nunlike the Qur’anic word malak, can designate both celestial and h uman agents (Leslau\n1991, 303; SL 764). The exclusively celestial reference of Qur’anic malak also contrasts with\nmlʾk in Epigraphic South Arabian, denoting a royal emissary (Robin 2019b, 122). Both\n2 Both Q 2:98 and 66:4 mention Gabriel, and the former also Michael— read mīkāl by some of the canonical\nreaders (cf. JPND 158–159 and KU 81), though there are miscellaneous variants like mīkāʾil, mīkāʾīl, and mīkaʾil\n(MQ 1:159–161 and MQQ 1:92–93)—in relatively close proximity to God’s “angels” (malāʾikah). Although Gabriel\nand Michael are not unequivocally identified as angels, their traditional status as archangels in the pre- Qur’anic\ntradition (see, e.g., Schäfer 1975, 20–23; cf. also Mathews 2009, 44–45, ll. 329–330) makes it likely that Q 2:98 and\n66:4 are picking out one or two particularly prominent or high- ranking angels. See also Blankinship 2020, 79–80.\n3 The names hārūt and mārūt are ultimately derived from t hose of two of the seven “bounteous immortals”\ncreated or fathered by Ahura Mazda according to Zoroastrian tradition (KU 146–148; QP 195).\n630 malak", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Boneschi has assembled\nextra- Qur’anic evidence showing that vari ous derivatives of the Arabic root ʾ-l -k w ere\nindeed used to denote the sending and conveying of messages (Boneschi 1945, 108); but\nthe Qur’an itself does not contain any other derivatives of e ither the roots ʾ- l- k or l- ʾ- k. It\nis in fact doubtful that Muhammad’s audience would have associated the word malak with\neither of t hese two roots: as Burge has astutely noted, the Qur’an finds it necessary to spell\nout that God has made the angels messengers (rusul; Q 22:75, 35:1; cf. also 2:98), which\nindicates that the word malak did not reliably convey the idea of messengership to the\nQur’anic addressees (Burge 2008, 53).4 In sum, Qur’anic malak is distinguished from its\nnon- Arabic cognates and parallels by being confined to angels as a species of super natural\nagents and intermediaries and by lacking a readily apparent Arabic derivational context\n(see also Bowersock 2013, 94).\nThe preceding observations are best explained by positing that malak either entered\nthe Arabic language as a loanword or that the inner- Arabic derivation proposed by Bon-\neschi ceased to be an item of common linguistic awareness once the word malak had\nbeen assigned the rather specific role of functioning as an Arabic equivalent of Hebrew\nmalʾāk, Greek angelos, Syriac malʾakā, or Ethiopic malʾak. Both scenarios difer from the\ndevelopment of a word like the native Arabic verb → kafara, which under the impact\nof its non- Arabic cognates underwent a secondary pro cess of semantic expansion from\ningratitude to repudiation yet did not shed its original association with ingratitude. In\nany case, the adoption of the word malak into Arabic in the sense of a celestial messenger\nmost likely occurred well before the Qur’an, since the plural malāʾik is found in a poten-\ntially au then tic poem attributed to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt (Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:16.32,\ncorresponding to al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:16.32; on the poem, see also Seidensticker 2011b,\n47–49).5 It is pertinent in this regard that in post- Biblical Hebrew, Greek, and Aramaic\nmalʾak, angelos, and malʾakā had all become increasingly l imited to their theological sense\nof emissaries sent by God, i.e., to angels in the conventional sense (e.g., Bowersock 2013,\n93; see, for instance, DTTM 786, DJBA 676–677, and DJPA 308). It stands to reason that\nwhen Jewish or Christian ideas and narratives began to be articulated in Old Arabic, this\nprogressive semantic confinement was also imprinted on Arabic malak, whether or not it\nhad previously carried the wider meaning of “messenger” in general.\nThe general nature of Qur’anic angels. Angels are created by God (Q 37:150, 43:19;\nsee also 35:1). Their usual dwelling place would seem to be in heaven (Q 53:26: wa- kam\n4 Post- Qur’anic lexicographers, however, do recognise that the noun malak is semantically connected with\nthe dispatching of a messenger or a message. Thus, al- Azharī maintains that malak was contracted from malʾak\n(which is itself assumed to go back to maʾlak, as also maintained by Boneschi), and he explains that the root ʾ- l- k\nconnotes the sending of a message (al- maʾlukah = al- risālah; see al- Azharī [1964–1976], 10:273.370, and cf. AEL\n81–82 and Boneschi 1945, 108). For late (fourteenth- century) evidence of an awareness that the root of malak\nis really l-ʾ - k, see al- Fayyūmī [1977?], 19, glossing laʾaka as arsala (noted in AEL 3007). Bowersock maintains\nthat there was an Arabic verb alʾaka, “to send,” but does not provide a reference (Bowersock 2013, 93). See also\nBoneschi 1945, 109, who considers alʾaka to be a denominative verb derived from malʾak. According to AEL 81,\nalʾiknī means “be my messenger, bear my message” (and also, according to some, “send me”). On the etymology\nof malak, see also Burge 2008, 51–52.\n5 Note that v. 36 of the poem calls the angels by the entirely un- Qur’anic expression “disciples of the deity”\n(talāmidhat al- ilāh), which supports authenticity.\nmalak 631", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The\ntrait of possessing wings, enabling the angels to “circulate between the world below and\nthe world above” (Robin 2019b, 70), reflects a widespread feature of late antique Christian\niconography (Martin 2001) that ties in with references to winged seraphim or cherubim\nin the Hebrew Bible (e.g., Ez 10 and Isa 6:2; see DTEK 121), even if the New Testament\nitself does not represent angels as winged (e.g., Matt 28:2–3).8 The angels’ wings are also\nmentioned in a poem attributed to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt referenced above (Schulthess\n1911a, no. 25:35–37 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:35–37). This confirms that this par tic u lar aspect\nof post-B iblical Christian angelology, like others, may be assumed to have been current\nin the Qur’anic milieu.\nDespite their wings and their potential invisibility, the default appearance of angels on\nearth is humanoid: “had we made him”— namely, the Qur’anic Messenger—“ an angel, we\nwould have made him a man (rajul),” i.e., endowed him with the appearance of an ordinary\nhuman, Q 6:9 affirms. Perhaps one is to understand that angels can exist in two dif er ent\nstates of aggregation, as it were: a celestial one involving wings and invisibility to the\nhuman eye, and a state of manifestation to humans, in which they appear by and large like\nhumans themselves (see also Burge 2012, 57). It is worth highlighting that Q 6:9, by virtue\nof employing the word rajul, additionally implies that angels are male. This corresponds\nto Biblical assumptions (e.g., Matt 16:5) and helps make sense of the Qur’anic polemic\nagainst belief in female angels (Q 17:40, 37:149–153, 43:16–19, 53:27–28; see also DTEK\n102). A par tic ul ar aspect of the angels’ humanoid appearance— namely, their possession of\nhands—is corroborated by Q 6:93, according to which the angels “stretch out their hands”\nfor the wrongdoers when t hese latter are in the throes of death (DTEK 121). Moreover, it\nmust be on account of the angels’ anthropomorphic appearance that Abraham initially\nmistook the divinely sent “messengers” (rusul) dispatched to him for ordinary humans,\nonly realising their super natural— i.e., angelic— status when his guests declined the food\nofered to them (Q 11:69–70 and 51:26–28; see below and Sinai 2020a, 282–283).9 The\ngenerally humanoid shape of Qur’anic angels also emerges from the fact that the female\nfriends of Joseph’s Egyptian mistress so admire him that they exclaim, “This is no human\nbut a noble angel!” (Q 12:31).\nThe Qur’anic scene recounting Abraham’s fearful realisation that he is hosting angelic\nguests is underpinned by the general assumption that celestial beings like angels do not\ningest material nourishment, a view already expressed in Judg 13:16 and Tob 12:19 (Reyn-\nolds 2010a, 94–95; see also Goodman 1986 and Kugel 1998, 342–345). Elsewhere, too, the\nQur’an reflects the notion that eating food is a trait of human agents, as opposed to divine\n6 See also the counterfactual in Q 17:95: “If there were angels on earth, walking about at peace . . .”\n7 These references hinge on the plausible assumption that the “hosts invisible to you” (junūd lam tarawhā)\nwhose assistance in battle is here retrospectively announced to the addressees are in fact angels. This seems very\nlikely in view of the parallels Q 3:124–125 and 8:9.12. See also the discussion in DTEK 91–92.\n8 On the Biblical cherubim and seraphim, see TDOT 7:307–319 and 14:223–228.

That angels do not require nourishment does\nnot however imply that the Qur’an understands them to be immaterial, even if there is\nancient pre ce dent for such a view.10 After all, the Qur’an does not seem to consider even\nGod himself to be immaterial in the strict sense of not being located in space (→ allāh).11\nBut the Qur’an does hint that angels live forever: according to Q 7:20, the devil promises\nAdam and Eve that eating from the prohibited tree w ill might make them “angels or im-\nmortal” (an takūnā malakayni aw takūnā mina l- khālidīn; → khalada; cf. Luke 20:36).12\nThe material constitution of angels is nowhere specified, but the Qur’an does say that\nthe jinn, and the jinni Iblīs or the devil (al- shayṭān) in par tic u lar, were created from fire\n(Q 7:12, 15:27, 38:76, 55:15; → jinn and → shayṭān). While the angels and the jinn must\nnot be conflated, it is pos si ble that the Qur’anic understanding of the angels, too, is that\nof beings fashioned from a particularly subtle kind of matter (DTEK 120–121). That the\nangels are made of light rather than fire, as posited by the post- Qur’anic Islamic tradition,\nis not supported by any unequivocal scriptural prooftexts (Chabbi 2020, 207), although\nit would perhaps accord with the fact that a number of Qur’anic passages imply that God\nhimself is luminous (→ allāh).\nAre angels capable of disobeying God? A number of Qur’anic passages stress that\nangels in general, and the angelic guardians of hell in par tic u lar (on whom see below),\n“do as they are commanded” (Q 16:50, 66:6: yafʿalūna mā yuʾmarūn; see also 21:27: wa-\nhum bi- amrihi yaʿmalūn),13 “do not disobey God” (Q 66:6: lā yaʿṣūna llāha), and “do not\ndeem themselves above serving him” (Q 7:206, 21:19: lā yastakbirūna ʿan ʿibādatihi; see\nalso 16:49: wa- hum lā yastakbirūn). Angels, it appears, are invariably obedient to God (see\nalready al-M āturīdī 2005–2007, 1:83; cf. Chittick 1989, 312) and from this perspective lack\nfree will.14 Unsurprisingly, when God orders the angels to prostrate to the newly created\nAdam, they obey (e.g., Q 7:11, 15:28–30), the only exception being Iblīs or the devil, who is\nhowever explic itly identified as a jinni (Q 18:50) rather than an angel (→ shayṭān). It may\nbe objected that the prooftexts just collated presuppose that it must at least be conceivable\nfor angels to disobey God, since other wise there would be no reason to praise them for\nobeying him (al- Māturīdī 2005–2007, 1:84). But the point of underscoring the angels’\nunfailing obedience to God may be less to exalt their moral merit for its own sake than to\nhold them up as exemplars to be emulated by the Qur’an’s human addressees (cf. DTEK\n104), despite the latter’s ingrained capability for evil. The Qur’an, in any case, elides any\nreference to fallen or disobedient angels. This is exemplified not only by casting Iblīs or the\ndevil as a jinni but also by Q 2:102 (see also u nder → jinn), where the ancient trope of illicit\nangelic instruction in sorcery (cf. 1 Enoch 7:1, 8:3 = Charlesworth 1983, 16) is reformulated\n10 For a link between in de pen dence from physical nourishment and incorporeality, see, e.g., Testament of\nAbraham (Recension A) 4:9, according to which “all the heavenly spirits are incorporeal and neither eat nor\ndrink” (Charlesworth 1983, 884; the passage is cited in Goodman 1986, 170).\n11 That there is no necessary contradiction between corporeality and having no need of food is illustrated\nby early Muslim thinkers like Muqātil ibn Sulaymān, who understood God to be a body yet devoid of digestive\nfunctions (van Ess 2018, 611).\n12 It is not obvious how this is to be reconciled with Q 28:88 and 55:26–27, according to which every thing\nother than God is perishable or will perish. But one might perhaps draw a distinction between being perishable\nin princi ple and perishing in fact.\n13 I assume that Q 16:50 applies only to the angels, mentioned at the end of the preceding verse.\n14 For a dif er ent reading, see Mir 1987, 14: angels “possess freedom of the will, but their nature is so pure\nand good— they are ‘the pure ones’ (56:79)— that they do not disobey God (66:6).”\nmalak 633", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, in the Medinan retelling of the\nstories of Zechariah and Mary, the protagonists are first addressed by angels but then\ngo on to address God directly (Q 3:39–41, 3:45–47; DTEK 82). Similarly, some Qur’anic\nretellings of the story of Lot attribute the destruction of his p eople and Lot’s deliverance\nto God’s angelic emissaries (Q 15:58–60, 29:32–34, 51:32–35), while others identify God\nhimself as the agent (Q 7:83–84, 21:74, 26:170–173, 27:57, 37:134–136, 54:34; DTEK 81).15\nThe act of taking a human from life (verb: tawaffā) is also interchangeably attributed to\nangels and to God himself (see below).16\nDespite the existence of Jewish and Christian lore about fallen or disobedient angels,\nthe Qur’an’s pre sen ta tion of the angels as invariably obedient to God is not without pre-\nce dent. Genesis Rabbah contains a dictum to the efect that angels are not “governed by\nthe inclination to evil (yēṣer ha- r aʿ)” (Gen. Rab. 48:11), and Augustine of Hippo main-\ntains that those angels who remained innocent of the dev il’s primordial rebellion against\nGod were rewarded with “a certain knowledge by which they would be secure of their\neternal stability and their assurance of never falling” (Muehlberger 2013, 43–56, citing\n44 = Augustine, Enchiridion 9:28).17 In addition, Jacob of Sarug describes God’s creation\nof the angelic hosts singing his praise in a way that makes them seem almost like liturgical\nautomata (Mathews 2009, 30–33, ll. 199–204, ll. 211–212, ll. 216–220). For comparative\npurposes, the Qur’an may be viewed as carry ing a quasi- Augustinian vision of the angels’\nmoral fixity back to the very moment of their creation, by removing even the idea of a\nprimordial act of angelic rebellion. It is admittedly unlikely that the Qur’an is directly or\nindirectly dependent on Augustine; but the parallels just adduced illustrate that the posi-\ntion that angels are inherently incapable of falling away from God was an available option\nto late antique thinkers, thus further increasing the probability that this is indeed what the\nQur’an is affirming in the verses cited above. Against this background, the reservations\nthat the angels voice against God’s plan to create man, whom they correctly predict to\nwreak corruption (→ afsada) on earth and to shed blood (Q 2:30), may be understood as\na narrative reflection on the merits of two dif er ent classes of beings: one reliably virtu-\nous and devoted to serving God yet devoid of free will, the other endowed with the dual\ncapacity for good and evil. The under lying theme of rivalry between angels and humans\n15 The same alternation is already observable in Biblical narrative (EJ 2:150; TDOT 8:319–320). For example,\nHagar is found and addressed by the “angel of the Lord” (Gen 16:7–12), but she then responds by addressing God\nhimself (Gen 16:13); and initially it is the “angel of the Lord” who appears to Moses (Exod 3:2), while in what\nfollows Moses converses with God (Exod 3:4 f.). See also Judg 6:11–18 or Gen 22:1.11.15.\n16 Commenting on the latter case, Welch invokes the concept of “corporate personality,” developed in\nBiblical studies, which he proposes to apply to “several cases in which certain actions for which God is held to\nbe ultimately responsible are sometimes said to be performed by certain of his agents, while in other contexts\nthe same actions are said to be performed by God himself” (Welch 1977, 192; see also Zahniser 1989, 19, noting\nQ 3:45–47 as a case in point).\n17 A dif er ent theoretisation of angels is articulated by Evagrius of Pontus, who understood “all rational\nbeings—a ngels, demons, and h uman beings—as inherently impermanent, mutable in their nature” (Muehlberger\n2013, 31; see in more detail ibid., 32–43).\n634 malak", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The roles carried out by angels in the\nQur’an are multifarious. To begin with, the angels are continuously engaged in performing\na heavenly liturgy, indefatigably singing God’s praise and prostrating to him (Q 2:30, 7:206,\n13:13, 17:49, 21:20, 39:75, 40:7, 41:38, 42:5). Qur’anic references to the heavenly worship\nof the angels are ultimately continuous with Isaiah’s vision of seraphim encircling God\non his throne and glorifying him (Isa 6:1–3; cf. Rev 4:8). Isa 6:3— according to which the\nangels exclaim, “Holy (qādôš, Peshitta: qaddīsh), holy, holy is the Lord of hosts”—is to\nbe compared in par tic u lar with Q 2:30, according to which the angels “declare God to be\nholy” (verb: qaddasa li-) .18 The t riple acclamation from Isa 6:3 is furthermore reflected in\nthe divine epithet quddūs, “holy,” employed in Q 59:23 and 62:1 (see under → qaddasa).\nThe celestial worship of the angels clearly forms a model for h uman worship of God (DTEK\n104).19 The Qur’an here reflects the idea, current in late antique Judaism and Christ ian ity,\nthat human worshippers imitate an angelic liturgy or even that they are invisibly joined\nby angels (Muehlberger 2013, 176–202; Ahuvia 2021, 118–142).\nQ 42:5 maintains that the angelic liturgy incorporates the angels’ pleading with God\nto forgive “t hose on earth” (yastaghfirūna li- man fī l- arḍi). A similar statement is found\nin Q 40:7, according to which the angels carry ing and surrounding God’s throne (ʿarsh)\nintercede on behalf of the believers (yastaghfirūna li-l ladhīna āmanū). This is followed\nby an extensive quotation of the angels’ prayer for divine forgiveness (Q 40:7–9; see\nO’Shaughnessy 1973, 206–207, and under → malik). The idea of angelic intercession on\nbehalf of humans, which the Qur’an expresses by the verb istaghfara, has ancient precur-\nsors (e.g., Job 33:23–24, 1 Enoch 40:5–6 = Charlesworth 1983, 32, and Testament of Dan\n6:2 = Charlesworth 1983, 810; see DTEK 97 and Schäfer 1975, 28–30 and 62–64). From\nearly on, however, the Qur’anic proclamations are committed to denying that on the day\nof judgement anyone might benefit from intercession (shafāʿah, verb: shafaʿa) with God\n(e.g., Q 2:123.254, 40:18, 74:48; on shafāʿah in the Qur’an and early poetry, see generally\nRiad 1981). This stance responds to the fact that the Qur’an’s pagan opponents, the “as-\nsociators” (alladhīna ashrakū, al-m ushrikūn), cast the intermediary deities worshipped\nby them as intercessors with the supreme deity Allāh (see under → ashraka). To this, the\nQur’an opposes the claim that God alone is humans’ sovereign judge and the only true\nintercessor (shafīʿ; Q 6:51.70, 32:4): no one w ill have his or her eschatological sentence\nmitigated because God’s verdict is swayed by the intervention of some third party.\nIt follows that when Q 40:7–9 or 42:5 portray the angels as pleading on behalf of h umans,\nthis should not be understood to credit them with any ability to influence and change\nGod’s decisions. Q 53:26 says as much by insisting that angelic intercession is only efective\nif undertaken with divine permission: “How many angels are there in the heavens whose\nintercession is of no benefit (lā tughnī shafāʿatuhum shayʾan) u ntil God gives permission\n(yaʾdhana) to whom he w ills and pleases.” Other verses (Q 2:255, 10:3, 20:109, 34:23) also\ncollocate the root sh- f-ʿ with the verb adhina, “to permit,” or with the noun idhn, “permis-\nsion” (cf. also Q 19:87 together with Riad 1981, 48–49).

This also emerges from Q 21:28, ac-\ncording to which the angels (whom v. 26 calls God’s “honoured servants”) “only intercede\non behalf of t hose with whom he”—i .e., God—“ is pleased” (wa- lā yashfaʿūna illā li- mani\nrtaḍā). In general, the angels surrounding God serve as a sort of celestial echo chamber of\nthe deity (DTEK 95), as when they are said to join God in saying blessings over (→ ṣallā\nʿalā) the believers and the Prophet (Q 33:43.56) and in cursing unrepentant unbelievers and\napostates (Q 2:161, 3:87).20 The angels, in other words, “are not actors, only extras”; they\nmerely form “an impersonal choir similar to classical theatre” (DTEK 95 and 85). Plausibly,\nthe Qur’anic insistence that angelic intercession is subject to divine permission or the like\nreflects “a situation in which many p eople did believe in the efficacy of angelic intercession,”\nto which the Qur’an reacted by seeking “to control that belief within the sovereignty of\nGod” (Bowker 1966, 71). But as Bowker also shows, the Qur’anic tendency to control and\nrestrict intercession is itself continuous with e arlier tendencies.21\nEschatological functions of the angels. All of the Qur’anic references to a celestial\nworship of the angels just surveyed are l ater Meccan or Medinan, perhaps reflecting the\nemergence or consolidation among Muhammad’s followers of new forms of communal\nworship that Neuwirth conjectures to have occurred during the l ater Meccan period (SPMC\n149–153 and 175–176; Neuwirth 2010, 459–471). By contrast, in the early Meccan surahs\nthe angels are primarily mentioned in eschatological contexts, in keeping with the early\nQur’an’s predominant kerygmatic concern with the resurrection and the last judgement\n(see generally Sinai 2017a). Thus, Q 89:22 affirms that at the end of the world “yourS Lord\nand the angels w ill come in ranks” (wa- jāʾa rabbuka wa- l- malaku ṣaffan ṣaffā). This escha-\ntological arrival of the angels may be contrasted with the New Testamental prediction of\nthe coming of the “Son of Man,” rather than God the Father, together with the angels (Matt\n16:27; DTEK 103 and Sinai 2017a, 246, n. 109; cf. also Dan 7:9–10). The angels’ eschatological\nstanding in rows is also mentioned in two other early Meccan passages, both of which like-\nwise employ derivatives of the root ṣ- f- f, Q 37:1–3 (see HCI 88–89) and 78:38.22 It deserves\nto be noted that Q 78:38 names the angels together with “the spirit” (→ al- rūḥ), a pairing\nalso found in the early Meccan passages 70:4 and 97:4 (and once more in the later Meccan\nverse 16:2). The angels’ eschatological appearance is further alluded to in a number of l ater\nMeccan and Medinan verses (Q 2:210, 6:158, 16:33, 25:22.25, 34:40, 69:17). In one case the\nmotif combines with the theme of the angels’ worship around the divine throne (Q 39:75).\nAs emerges from Q 2:210, 6:8.158, 16:33, and 15:7–8, the end of the world is in fact the only\n20 For two other passages in which the angels are performing the same echoing role, see Q 3:18 and 4:166.\n21 Bowker establishes that attempts to restrict the power of intercession with God, to subject intercession to\nGod’s ultimate sovereignty, or to deny it altogether can already be glimpsed in Jewish lit er a ture (Bowker 1966,\n75–82; see, e.g., 4 Ezra 7:102–115 = Charlesworth 1983, 540–541 and y. Bәr. 9:1, 13a = ed. and trans. Guggenheimer,\n614). This leads Bowker to conclude that “the ambiguity in the Qurʾān about intercession is not simply the\nresult of Muhammad attempting to counteract a well- established belief and practice” but is “also the result of a\nhesitation which already existed” (Bowker 1966, 82). I owe my awareness of Bowker’s article to Rachel Dryden.\n22 The root ṣ- f- f can have martial connotations, as demonstrated by its occurrence in the Medinan verse\nQ 61:4, and this may also be an aspect of the scene sketched in 37:1–3, 78:38, and 89:22.\n636 malak", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The involvement of angels with the posthumous fate\nof humans begins with the latter’s death, for it is angels who are often said to take individ-\nuals from life (→ tawaffā; see Q 4:97, 6:61.93, 7:37, 8:50, 16:28.32, 32:11, 47:27; see DTEK\n104–110 and also KK 142),23 even if the same act is also frequently ascribed to God himself\n(Q 3:55.193, 5:117, 6:60, 7:126, 10:46.104, 12:101, 13:40, 16:70, 39:42, 40:77) and once to\ndeath in the abstract (Q 4:15). The general idea resembles a Talmudic passage according to\nwhich deceased h umans, both right eous and sinful, w ill be met by several contingents of\nministering angels or of “angels of destruction” (b. Kәtub. 104a; DTEK 113). Following the\nresurrection, humans are presented before the divine judge by an usher or sāʾiq, who may\nalso be assumed to be an angel (Q 50:21; see DTEK 109).24 After the righ teous have passed\nmuster, it is angels who welcome them to paradise (Q 16:32, 21:103, 39:73) and attend to\nthem therein (Q 13:23). Moreover, Eichler plausibly argues that the “men” (rijāl) who ac-\ncording to Q 7:46 are positioned on the barrier between the saved and the damned are in\nfact angelic guardians controlling access to paradise (DTEK 113–114). And just as there are\n“keepers” (khazanah) of paradise (Q 39:73), so there are keepers of hell (Q 39:71, 40:49,\n67:8; see also DTEK 113). That Medinan verses explic itly identify the guardians of hell as\nangels (Q 66:6, 74:30–31; on the latter, see Sinai 2017c, 73–75), rather than demons, is no-\ntable (DTEK 110) and surely serves to underscore that no domain is outside God’s control.\nReferences to God’s angelic prison guards and executioners also permit the recounting of\nexchanges between them and the damned, which highlight the hopelessness and guilt of\nthose consigned to hell (see Q 39:71–72, 40:49–50, 67:8–11; DTEK 111).25\nThe angels as agents of surveillance. Another impor tant, and ultimately also eschato-\nlogically oriented, role of Qur’anic angels is to aid God’s comprehensive monitoring and\nrecording of all human actions, good or bad. When serving in this capacity, the angels\nare sometimes described with the participle ḥāfiẓ, “watcher” (plural: ḥafaẓah or ḥāfiẓūn;\nsee Q 6:61, 82:10, 86:4). The corresponding verb ḥafiẓa, “to watch over s.o.,” occurs in\nQ 13:11, according to which every one is attended by “followers in front of him and a fter\nhim, who watch over him by God’s command” (lahu muʿaqqibātun min bayni yadayhi wa-\nmin khalfihi yaḥfaẓūnahu min amri llāhi). It is vital to underscore that the Qur’an’s angelic\nwatchers are not guardian angels of the kind described, for instance, in Ps 91:11–12 (see\nSchäfer 1975, 27–28 and 60–62) but rather “celestial police officers” who “continuously\nminute the behaviour of those humans with whose surveillance they have been tasked”\n(DTEK 87). As Q 10:21 puts it, “our messengers rec ord in writing all of your schemes” (inna\n23 The only passage that explic itly mentions an “angel of death” (malak al- mawt) is Q 32:11; all other verses\nattribute the taking of h umans from life to an indistinct plurality of angels or divinely commissioned “messen-\ngers” (rusul).\n24 Cf. Q 39:71.73, according to which the repudiators and the God- fearing “are driven” (sīqa) to hell or to\nparadise. Q 19:86 has the active nasūqu, in the divine voice (“we drive the evildoers to hell”). See also Q 75:30\nwith the corresponding verbal noun masāq.\n25 Also relevant is Q 43:77, where the inhabitants of hell address a figure called mālik. Given the material\nsurveyed in the main text, this must also be an angel. The verse presupposes that mālik is subordinate to the divine\n“Lord”; as Eichler notes, he is “not an in de pen dent ruler of hell, but rather a servant of Allāh” (DTEK 111). Lange\n2016b, 89–91, proposes to read yā-malaku (“O angel!”) rather than yā-māliku. More elusive is Q 96:18, where\nthe divine voice threatens the sinner with calling forth al- zabāniyah (see CDKA 120 and Lange 2016b; cf. the\nearly poetic parallel in EAP 1:97–98 and 100, which is however unlikely to be pre- Qur’anic).\nmalak 637", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The idea is fully attested already in the\nearly Meccan period. Thus, according to Q 86:4 every one has a watcher appointed over him\nor her (in kullu nafsin lammā ʿalayhā ḥāfiẓ), while Q 82:10–12 elaborates: “Set up over youp\nare watchers (wa- inna ʿalaykum la-ḥ āfiẓīn), // noble ones, recording in writing (kirāman\nkātibīn), // who know what you are d oing.”26 Q 50:17–18, which narrowly falls outside the\nearly Meccan surahs, depicts how a h uman cannot utter a word “without a ready observer\nbeing by his side,” prob ably to rec ord every thing in preparation for the final judgement\n(v. 18: mā yalfiẓu min qawlin illā ladayhi raqībun ʿatīd). It stands to reason that the universal\nregister book that w ill be consulted at the eschatological judgement and the individual reg-\nister books that w ill be handed over to each h uman (see u nder → kitāb) are the products\nof the activity of these recording angels (DTEK 89). It is noteworthy that at Q 50:4 the\ndivine voice claims to be in possession of a “watchful rec ord” (kitāb ḥafīẓ), thus employing\nthe same root ḥ- f-ẓ that also describes God’s surveillance angels.\nThe Qur’anic surveillance angels bear a general resemblance to the rabbinic idea that\nevery person is accompanied by two ministering angels, one good and one evil (b. Shabb.\n119b; b. Bәr. 60b, both of which are already noted in DTEK 87–88; see also Urbach 1987,\n1:159–161, and Schäfer 1975, 61–62). Although t hese angels do not invariably seem to be\nresponsible for recording an individual’s deeds, two Talmudic dicta state that they w ill\n“testify against” a person (b. Ḥag. 16a and b. Taʿan. 11a).27 The idea that angels are active\nas divinely commissioned informers is also found in 1 Enoch 100:10 (Charlesworth 1983,\n81–82) and Jubilees (= VanderKam 1989) 4:6. 1 Enoch 104:7 (Charlesworth 1983, 85) specif-\nically threatens the sinners that “all your sins are being written down e very day” (similarly\n1 Enoch 98:7–8 = Charlesworth 1983, 78–79; see Schäfer 1975, 30–31, who also references\nJubilees = VanderKam 1989, ch. 30:20–22).\nAn angelic or quasi- angelic being as the con vey or of the Qur’anic revelations\n(e.g., Q 81:19). The Qur’anic proclamations are beholden to the by then centuries- old\nassumption that divine revelations are relayed by angelic or quasi- angelic intermediaries\n(a view exemplified, for instance, by Jubilees = VanderKam 1989, ch. 1:27 or Gal 3:19; see\nEJ 2:154). Thus, already the early Meccan verse Q 81:19 describes Muhammad’s revelatory\npronouncements as “the speech of a noble messenger (rasūl karīm).” This likely refers to a\nsuperhuman intermediary rather than to Muhammad, given that Q 81:20–21 characterise\nthe “noble messenger” as being close to the incumbent of the heavenly throne (v. 20: dhī\nquwwatin ʿinda dhī l-ʿ arshi makīn, “endowed with power near the one on the throne, firmly\nestablished”) and as enjoying special authority in the celestial realm (v. 21: muṭāʿin thamma\namīn, “obeyed t here, trustworthy”). That the Qur’an occasionally applies the term rasūl to\nangelic rather than human messengers was already noted above, and the profile emerging\nfrom Q 81:19–21 certainly fits a superhuman being much better than Muhammad (Bell 1934,\n149–150; Fossum 1993, 149; PP 301). Muhammad himself, it would seem, is introduced\n26 In line with the ascribability of angelic actions to God himself that was noted earlier, other verses cast\nGod himself as exercising direct oversight over all humans (e.g., Q 11:57, 42:6, 84:15). The same applies to the act\nof recording h uman actions in writing: “We rec ord in writing what they have accomplished and the deeds they\nhave left behind (naktubu mā qaddamū wa-ā thārahum), and we have added every thing up in a clear ledger (wa-\nkulla shayʾin aḥṣaynāhu fī imāmin mubīn),” Q 36:12 says. See also Q 78:29 (wa- kulla shayʾin aḥṣaynāhu kitābā).\n27 I owe my awareness of t hese passages to Urbach 1987, 1:161 and 2:756–757. Interestingly, both statements\nare followed by an alternative view according to which it is the limbs of a deceased that w ill testify against him,\nan idea that also has Qur’anic parallels (Q 24:24, 36:65, 41:20–23).\n638 malak", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, the early Meccan passage Q 26:192–195 and\nthe later Meccan verse Q 16:102 declare that the Qur’anic proclamations are “brought\ndown” (→ nazzala or nazala bi- ) by “the trustworthy spirit” (Q 26:193: al- rūḥ al- amīn)\nor “the holy spirit” (Q 16:102: rūḥ al-q udus). Moreover, a closely interrelated triplet of\nverses affirms that God c auses “the spirit” to descend upon whom he w ills or that God\nhas inspired the Qur’anic addressee with “a spirit” (Q 16:2, 40:15, and 42:52; see in more\ndetail u nder → amr). It deserves to be noted that one of these references to the spirit,\nin Q 42:52, comes directly after the allusion to God’s communication of revelations by\nmeans of a superhuman rasūl or emissary in Q 42:51 that was cited above. In the developed\nprophetology of the later Meccan period, the superhuman “emissary” conveying God’s\nrevelations to Muhammad, who appears as early as Q 81:19, is therefore identified as “the\nspirit.” Determining the nature of the Qur’anic spirit is not straightforward (see in more\ndetail under → rūḥ), since some passages seem to depict the spirit as an aspect or quality of\nGod himself that is “breathed” into Adam (Q 15:29, 32:9, 38:72) and Mary (Q 21:91, 66:12),\nwhile elsewhere the spirit appears to be an in de pen dent figure acting in conjunction with\nthe angels (Q 70:4, 78:38, 97:4). In any case, what ever the precise relationship of the spirit\nto God, it is impor tant to note that the spirit is never expressly said to be one of the angels\n(Rahman 2009, 95–96). The closest the Qur’an comes to asserting specifically angelic\nmediation of Muhammad’s revelations is the Medinan verse Q 2:97, which identifies the\none who “brings down” revelations upon Muhammad’s heart (nazzalahu ʿalā qalbika) as\nGabriel, whom Jews and Christians traditionally consider to be an archangel.30\n28 The prob lem of identifying the “noble messenger” of Q 81:19 is admittedly complicated by the fact that\nthe verse has a doublet in Q 69:40, which also runs innahu la- qawlu rasūlin karīm. But in Q 69:40, the statement\nthat “it”—p erhaps the Qur’anic revelations in general—is the “speech of a noble messenger” contrasts with a\ndenial that “it” is the speech of a poet (shāʿir) or of a soothsayer (kāhin); since poets and soothsayers are human\nfigures, Q 69:40 is therefore most naturally read as applying the descriptor “noble messenger” to a h uman rather\nthan to an angel. Moreover, in Q 44:17, too, the expression “noble messenger” (rasūl karīm) is clearly attached\nto a human figure, Moses (Bell 1934, 150, n. 10; Welch 1983, 26). This human understanding of the term “noble\nmessenger” cannot, however, be easily carried over to Q 81:19, due to the characterisation put forward in vv. 20\nand 21 (against Williams 2008, 134–136). Bell and Welch seek to neutralise the difficulty that vv. 20–21 pose to a\nhuman identification of the “noble messenger” in v. 19 by questioning that vv. 20–21 are original to their context,\nbut the text does not exhibit any evident redactional seams (see Bell 1934, 150, n. 10, and Welch 1983, 26). There is\nlittle choice, then, but to conclude, however unsatisfactorily, that Q 81:19 and 69:40 employ an identical phrase\nin dif er ent meanings, the one to refer to an angelic messenger, the other to a human one.\n29 Q 42:51 enumerates a total of three dif er ent modalities of revelation: God may speak to a h uman by\n“conveying” something to him (waḥyan) or “from behind a veil” or, fi nally, by having recourse to a mediating\nmessenger.\n30 That the spirit is at least functionally comparable to the angels also emerges from comparing Q 19:17\n(God causes his spirit to appear to Mary) with the later Medinan retelling of the scene in Q 3:42 f., where Mary\nis addressed by “the angels.”\nmalak 639", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The remaining angelic functions can be treated\nmore summarily. The early Meccan verse Q 97:4 alludes to a special night during which\n“the angels and the spirit” descend to earth in order to transmit God’s decrees or com-\nmands to the created order (→ amr). In addition, angels are said to fortify believers in\nthis world (Q 41:30–32). A number of Medinan verses remind the believers in general or\nMuhammad in par tic u lar of angelic assistance in battle or an other wise dangerous situa-\ntion (Q 3:124–127, 8:9–14, 9:26.40, 33:9). Some of these verses explic itly underscore the\nangels’ invisibility (Q 9:26.40, 33:9) while others cast the angels’ impact in psychological\nterms: “God only intended it [the preceding promise about angelic assistance] to serve as\ngood tidings ±​<for youp> and so that your hearts might ±​<thereby> come to be secure\n(iṭmaʾanna)” (Q 3:126, 8:10: wa- mā jaʿalahu llāhu illā bushrā ±​<lakum> wa- li- taṭmaʾinna\nqulūbukum ±​<bihi>). It can accordingly be argued that the point of the angelic assistance\nproclaimed in the verses just listed, too, is to engender inner fortification of the believers\nrather than to produce an outwardly verifiable impact (DTEK 91–93, who also notes 2 Kgs\n6:16–17 as a pos si ble parallel). Moreover, God has in the past dispatched angels in order\nto transmit glad tidings (bushrā, verb: bashshara) to Abraham (e.g., Q 11:69, 29:31), Zech-\nariah (Q 3:39), and Mary (Q 3:45) and also to punish the sinful compatriots of Lot (e.g.,\nQ 15:57–77, 29:31–35, 51:31–37). Another Qur’anic allusion to a past angelophany is found\nin Q 2:248, according to which the Israelites were promised by an anonymous prophet\n(presumably corresponding to the Biblical Samuel) that the ark (al- tābūt) they would be\ngiven was to be carried by angels (see DTEK 82, speculating that this may reflect the repre-\nsen ta tion of cherubim on the ark of the covenant according to Exod 25:18–20 and 37:7–9).\nThe Qur’anic pagans and angels. Qur’anic polemics against Muhammad’s pagan adver-\nsaries, the so- called “associators” (al- mushrikūn, alladhīna ashrakū), imply that they too\ndeployed the concept of angels. Specifically, they appear to have cast some of their deities\nas female angels (Q 17:40, 34:40–41, 37:150, 43:19, 53:27; see also u nder → ashraka), an idea\nthat is not completely unheard of in late antiquity (Horsley and Luxford 2016, 144–145;\nAhuvia 2021, 138–139).31 The Qur’an, by contrast, rejects any kind of angel worship, in\nkeeping with its understanding that angels are mere instruments of God who are entirely\nsubordinate to their divine master. In the Qur’anic milieu, angel worship does not seem\nto have been the exclusive preserve of pagans, since one passage also associates it with the\nscripture- owners (Q 3:80; see DTEK 98). This fits the traces of angel veneration that can\nbe discerned in rabbinic and Christian texts (Schäfer 1975, 67–72; Cline 2011, 137–165).\nNonetheless, there can be no doubt that the notion of angelic intermediaries was not\nconfined to Jews and Christian in the Qur’anic context. Pagan recourse to the concept\nof angels is not unprec e dented, as shown by Greek inscriptions from Roman Asia Minor\ninvoking a “divine angelos” or “angelic divinity” (theiō angelō or theiō angelikō), who may\nhave functioned as an intermediary figure between mortals and the supreme deity (Cline\n2011, 47–76, and Horsley and Luxford 2016). One may of course entertain the possibility\nthat passages like Q 17:40, which protest against the Qur’anic opponents’ view that the\nangels are female, are to be read in such a way that it was not the opponents themselves who\ndeployed the concept of angels: perhaps Muhammad’s adversaries w ere simply speaking of\n31 Horsley and Luxford discuss a pagan Greek inscription from Roman Asia Minor that features a female\nangel (tēs angelou).

As we saw e arlier, several Qur’anic passages suggest that Muhammad’s revelations\nwere relayed by an angel or at least a quasi-a ngelic intermediary. The associators seem to\nhave accepted the idea of revelation-bearing angels at least for the sake of argument, since\nthey are portrayed as expecting that someone purporting to convey divine revelations\nwould either himself be an angel or would be associated with one.33 Thus, Muhammad’s\nantagonists, like those of Noah and other messengers, object to one another that he is\nobviously nothing but “a mere human like yourselves” (illā basharun mithlukum; Q 21:3;\nsee also Q 11:27, 14:10–11, 23:24.33, 26:154.186, 36:15); they incredulously ask w hether God\nhas sent “a human as a messenger” (a- baʿatha llāhu basharan rasūlā; Q 17:94); and they\ncomplain to Muhammad that no angel has been “sent down upon him” (unzila ʿalayhi/\nilayhi), “has come with him,” or the like (Q 6:8, 11:12, 15:7, 17:92, 23:24, 25:7), thus reprising\nthe objections that were reputedly voiced against previous messengers (Q 41:14, 43:53;\nsee in general Hawting 2011 and QP 102–124). The complaint that Muhammad “eats food\nand goes around the marketplaces” (Q 25:7.20; see also 21:7–8) is rooted in the same\nexpectation of a verifiably angelic messenger, since the Qur’anic milieu seems to have in-\nherited the ancient view that angels do not eat (see above). Against this, the Qur’an avers\nthat God’s messengers, whose task it is to warn human recipients and to recount God’s\n“signs” (singular: → āyah) to them, are “from among” (min or min anfus) their address-\nees (see under → rasūl). This postulate has an evident ethnic dimension: a prophet- like\nmessenger of God must be native to the community addressed by him and speak their\nlanguage (Q 14:4). Yet it also encompasses the notion that a prophet-l ike messenger who\nis to address h umans must himself be h uman and “eat food” (Q 6:130, 7:35; see also Q 14:11,\n18:110, and 41:6 as well as 5:75, 21:7–8, and 25:7.20; cf. Radscheit 1996a, 72). “I do not say\nto you that I am an angel (innī malakun),” both the Qur’anic Messenger and Noah tell their\nopponents in Q 6:50 and 11:31, respectively.\nIf the Qur’an itself claims that Muhammad’s revelations reached him through some\nform of super natural intermediary who, minimally, exhibits considerable similarity to an\nangel, why is this claim never invoked in direct response to the opponents’ demand that\nMuhammad be associated with an angel (see already Bell 1934, 149)? Most likely, what\nMuhammad’s opponents were really demanding, in expecting divine revelations to be\nconveyed by angels, was “something they could see and hear and possibly talk to” (Rah-\nman 2009, 97). The point of contention, then, was less about the specific mechanism of\nrevelatory communication than about miraculous evidentiary confirmation accessible\n32 Eichler holds that the pagans’ contention that their goddesses were angels was only an apol o getic re-\nsponse to Muhammad’s preaching (DTEK 101–102 and also 99–100). But this view still accepts at least that the\nassociators themselves spoke of their deities as angels.\n33 Crone frames this assumption in semantic terms: to the associators, “rasūl seems always to have meant\nan angel in a religious context” (QP 109–110).\nmalak 641", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, Q 17:90–93 enumerates assorted miracles and extraordinary\nachievements allegedly demanded by the Qur’anic adversaries (including the request that\nMuhammad “cause the heaven to fall down upon us, as youS have claimed”), and in Q 25:21\nthe opponents are quoted as demanding not only a descent of the angels but also to see\nGod himself. Thus parsed, the opponents’ objections would not have been convincingly\nanswered by insisting that the Qur’anic revelations w ere indeed conveyed by an angelic\nor quasi- angelic being who was however acting in a publicly unverifiable manner directly\nupon Muhammad’s heart (Q 26:194; see also 2:97), just as Zechariah or Mary reportedly\nhad private encounters with angels (Q 3:39.42.45).\nMore efectively, Q 6:8 and 15:8 therefore respond that the request that humans are to\nbelieve despite lacking direct and publicly accessible empirical confirmation is precisely\nthe point: if God were to provide truly incontrovertible confirmation of Muhammad’s\nclaim by sending down a being that is indisputably identifiable as an angel, then “the\nmatter would have been settled” (Q 6:8: la-q uḍiya l-a mru) and humans would “have no\nfurther respite” (Q 6:8: thumma lā yunẓarūn; 15:8: mā kānū idhan munẓarīn) to mend their\nways, meaning that the win dow of opportunity for conversion and repentance would have\nclosed once and for all.34 Moreover, as Q 6:9 adds, had God made Muhammad an angelic\nmessenger, he would have “made him a man,” that is, he would have made him appear\nlike an ordinary human, just as the angels sent to Abraham appeared like ordinary men.\nThe general assumption under lying both responses is that humans are bidden to heed\nGod’s call precisely in the absence of any overwhelming empirical display of the deity’s\nexistence and power, simply in light of the abundant “signs” (singular: → āyah) that God\nhas provided in the natu ral world and throughout history. Conversely, to believe in God\nonly when faced with his crushing punitive power is too late and accordingly devoid of\nany merit (Sinai 2019a, 248–249). From the Qur’anic perspective, it is therefore concep-\ntually inevitable that God must have recourse to spokespersons who are, or appear to be,\ncomparatively ordinary, i.e., who are not endowed with abilities and achievements that\nradically and indubitably surpass those of their addressees.35 For instance, just as Mu-\nhammad disavows any claim to being an angel, his authority is said not to be predicated\non access to “God’s trea sures” or on clairvoyant knowledge of “the hidden” (→ al-g hayb;\nQ 6:50 and 11:12.31). It is thus because a messenger must not miraculously stand out that\nhuman addressees are sent a messenger “from among” (min or min anfus) themselves\n(see u nder → rasūl). Conversely, it would have been appropriate for God to dispatch an\nangel as his public spokesperson only if the earth were trodden not by humans but by\nangels (Q 17:95).\nmalik, malīk | king\nmulk | kingship, rulership, reign\nmalakūt | kingdom, kingship\n34 See also Q 25:22, which similarly suggests, by employing the eschatologically laden qualifier yawmaʾidhin,\n“on that day,” that the day on which the adversaries will see the angels is the day of judgement.\n35 A dif er ent reasoning is found in Q 6:111: the obduracy of Muhammad’s adversaries is such that even if God\nwere to orchestrate all sorts of stupendous miracles, such as “sending down the angels to them” or causing the dead\nto speak, the opponents “would not believe, except if God willed it” (mā kānū li- yuʾminū illā an yashāʾa llāhu).\n642 malik", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

While the Qur’an recognises the phenomenon of earthly rulership and king-\nship (e.g., Q 2:246–247, 5:20, 12:43.50.54),1 it is God who is “the true king” (Q 20:114,\n23:116: al-m alik al- ḥaqq). Other verses applying the word malik, “king,” to God are\nQ 59:23, 62:1, and 114:2,2 while Q 54:55 has the variant malīk. Being the ultimate sov-\nereign of the cosmos, God confers earthly kingship upon whom he w ills (Q 2:247, 3:26:\nwa- llāhu yuʾtī mulkahu man yashāʾu; see also 2:251.258, 4:54, 12:101, all of which combine\nGod as the subject of ātā, “to give,” with the object mulk) and strips it away from whom\nhe wills (Q 3:26: wa-t anziʿu l-m ulka mimman tashāʾu). God is, accordingly, the “owner of\nkingship” (Q 3:26: mālik al- mulk), i.e., the supreme source and bestower of all rulership\nand royal authority. Just like earthly kings, the divine king is seated on a throne (ʿarsh; e.g.,\nQ 7:54, 9:129, 10:3, 11:7, 13:2, 20:5, 23:116, 39:75, 85:15; see generally O’Shaughnessy 1973).\nAccording to one verse—w hich exceptionally refers to the divine throne with the word\nkursiyy (FVQ 249; cf. Aramaic / Syriac kūrsyā)— God’s throne “encompasses the heavens\nand the earth” (Q 2:255: wasiʿa kursiyyuhu l- samāwāti wa-l -a rḍa), meaning the totality\nof creation (see under → al- arḍ).3 Also like an earthly monarch, God is surrounded by a\nroyal court, the “assembly on high” (→ ˻al- malaʾ al- aʿlā), comprising angels who are said\nto carry and surround his throne (Q 39:75, 40:7, 69:17; see O’Shaughnessy 1973, 206–207)\nand to be engaged in performing a celestial liturgy (e.g., Q 42:5; see u nder → malak). Many\nother aspects of the Qur’an’s depiction of God have royal connotations as well (Rippin\n2006, 227–228), such as references to God’s control over cosmic “trea sures” or “stores”\n(khazāʾin; e.g., Q 6:50, 11:31, 15:21–22, 17:100; cf. the earthly context of the term in 12:55).\nThe fact that the Qur’anic God appoints and deposes his “deputies” (khalāʾif, singular:\nkhalīfah) on the earth, too, can be understood as a royal trait (see u nder → istakhlafa and\nSchenzle 2017, 132–133).\nAs counter parts to the abstract nouns “kingship” and “kingdom,” the Qur’an employs\nboth mulk and malakūt. The former word is frequent and occurs both in a worldly context\n(e.g., Q 2:102: mulk sulaymān, “the reign of Solomon”)4 and a theological one (e.g., to God\nbelongs “kingship over the heavens and the earth,” lahu/li- llāhi mulku l-s amāwāti wa- l- arḍi;\nQ 2:107, 3:189, 5:17.18.40.120, 25:2, 85:9, and elsewhere). By contrast, malakūt— a loanword\nfrom Aramaic (FVQ 270–271; van Putten 2020b, 70)—is only found in four verses, twice\nin the expression “the kingdom of the heavens and the earth” (Q 6:75, 7:185: malakūt al-\nsamāwāti wa-l -a rḍi) and twice in the statement that God holds “kingship over every thing”\n(Q 23:88 and 36:83: bi- yadihi malakūtu kulli shayʾin; see also u nder → qadīr). Malakūt kull\nshayʾ seems to be a variant of the more common mulk al-samāwāt wa-l-arḍ,5 whereas\nthe expression malakūt al-s amāwāt wa-l -a rḍ at Q 6:75 and 7:185 may highlight the cosmic\n1 Sometimes al- mulk would seem to be used in the general sense of rulership rather than specifically kingship;\nsee Q 12:101 and perhaps also 4:54.\n2 Van Putten 2020b, 70, identifies malik as a likely Aramaic loanword.\n3 Both ʿarsh and kursiyy are also applied to earthly thrones (Q 12:100, 27:23.38.41.42, 38:34).\n4 On Q 2:102, see in more detail under → jinn.\n5 The only verse that combines bi- yadihi with mulk rather than malakūt is Q 67:1.\nmalik 643", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For Q 1:4, the Islamic tradition rec ords\ndif er ent readings of the consonantal skeleton of the Qur’an’s standard recension. Most\nprinted editions have mālik yawm al- dīn (“owner of the day of judgement”), traced back\nto ʿĀṣim and al- Kisāʾī. The remaining canonical readers, by contrast, are reported to have\nread malik, “king” (MQQ 1:7; Ibn Mujāhid 1972, 104; al- Dānī 1930, 18).7 Al-Z amaksharī\nendorses the reading malik on account of Qur’anic parallels (Zam. 1:115). This general\nline of argument in favour of malik, already found in Ibn Mujāhid (see Ibn Mujāhid 1972,\n104), is cogent. Thus, Q 40:16, speaking of the day of judgement, poses the rhetorical\nquestion, “To whom belongs the kingship (al-m ulk) today?,” to which the answer is,\n“To God, the only one, the mighty one.” The notion of God’s kingship (al-m ulk) on the\nday of judgement is moreover attested in Q 6:73, 22:56, and 25:26, making it likely that\nQ 1:4 expresses the same idea.8 As we saw above, moreover, the epithet “king” (malik\nor, in one case, malīk) is predicated of God in further verses, even though these do not,\nlike Q 1:4, employ the title in an explic itly eschatological context. There is one verse that\napplies to God the participle mālik, namely, Q 3:26, which could be adduced in support\nof the ʿĀṣim and al- Kisāʾī reading of Q 1:4 (Ibn Mujāhid 1972, 104). However, the word\nthere occurs as part of the phrase mālik al-m ulk, “the owner of kingship,” where malik\nwould hardly be feasible; and the basic point made in Q 3:26, too, is in any case that God\nis invested with ultimate kingship.\nIn sum, malik yawm al- dīn is undoubtedly the preferable variant for Q 1:4 (thus also\nKhademalsharieh 2020, 355–359). Al- Zamaksharī maintains that the meaning of this gen-\nitive construction (literally, “the king of judgement day”) is adverbial: God is king on\njudgement day (Zam. 1:116), just as four verses referenced above state that “on the day” of\njudgement kingship is exercised by God (Q 6:73: lahu l-m ulku yawma . . . ; 22:56: al- mulku\nyawmaʾidhin li-l lāhi; 25:26: al-m ulku yawmaʾidhini l- ḥaqqu li-l -r aḥmāni; 40:16: li- mani\nl-m ulku l-y awma). It deserves to be noted that at least two of the three verses describing\nGod’s throne as surrounded or carried by angels also occur in an eschatological context\n(Q 39:75, 69:17).9 The statement that God is “the king on judgement day” in Q 1:4 thus\naccentuates that God’s kingly rule, although a constant fact of cosmic existence, finds its\nultimate manifestation and consummation at the final judgement.\nBiblical and ancient Arabian background. The idea of divine kingship is an entrenched\npart of the Biblical tradition, drawing on ancient Near Eastern culture more generally (e.g.,\nPs 47:3.7.8, 93:1; see TDOT 8:346–375; NIDOTTE 2:956–965; Caird 1980, 178–182).10 The\nNew Testament uses the phrase “kingdom of heaven” (hē basileia tōn ouranōn) to refer\n6 For a brief discussion of the scene introduced by Q 6:75, see under → allāh.\n7 On the meaning of mālik, see al- Thaʿlabī 2015, 2:417–418, who also pre sents the opinion that the word has\nthe same meaning as malik, a view that would make the two variant readings u nder consideration semantically\nequivalent. However, the fact that the opposing view, according to which the two words are not in fact synon-\nymous, is set out last, in greater detail, and based on named authorities would seem to convey that al- Thaʿlabī,\nquite reasonably, finds it more persuasive.\n8 Th ere are further verses that ascribe al- mulk to God, e.g., Q 67:1 or, frequently, “the kingdom of the heavens\nand the earth” (e.g., Q 2:107 and 3:189).\n9 As noted in O’Shaughnessy 1973, 207, Q 40:7 too has at least eschatological undertones, because the\npassage “mentions the reward and punishment that are the outcome of the judgment.”\n10 On the kindred idea of divine lordship, see under → rabb.\n644 malik", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This supplies a clear precursor for the\npalpable eschatological connotations that God’s kingship (mulk) has in vario us Qur’anic\npassages. Even closer to the Qur’an’s diction are New Testamental mentions of the “king-\ndom of God” (hē basileia tou theou; e.g., Acts 14:22, Rom 14:17, 1 Cor 4:20), especially in\ntheir Syriac rendering (Peshitta: malkūteh da- llāhā; cf. Arabic malakūt). The coming of\nGod’s kingly reign (basileia, malkūtā) is also an integral part of the Lord’s Prayer (Matt\n6:10 and Luke 11:2), and God’s kingship figures as a vocative in the G reat Doxology (kurie\nbasileu epouranie, “Lord, celestial king”; Metzger 1985–1987, 3:112–113).\nThe application of royal language to God seems to have been current in late antique\nArabic. For instance, a poem transmitted under the name of Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt like-\nwise calls God a “king” (malik; Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:29 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:29; on the\nlikely authenticity of this poem, see the verdicts compiled in Seidensticker 2011b, 47–49).\nSpecifically the variant malīk (used in Q 54:55) occurs in a poem from the dīwān of Mu-\nhammad’s cont emporary al-A ʿshā Maymūn: “And you know that the h uman soul w ill meet\nits death in what ever manner its creator, the King (al- malīk), has ordained for it” (Ḥusayn\n1983, no. 3:54). The same term is also found in another verse by al-A ʿshā, describing a monk\nengaged in “prayers to the King” (ṣalawāt al- malīk; Ḥusayn 1983, no. 5:63).11\nmillah | religion, religious teaching\nmillat ibrāhīm | the teaching of Abraham\nFurther vocabulary discussed: dīn | religion, religious worship ḥanīf | fervently\ndevoted to worshipping God al- mushrikūn, alladhīna ashrakū pl. | the associators\nmalaʾ | c ommunity leaders, notables alladhīna kafarū, al- kāfirūn, al- kuffār pl. |\nthe repudiators ākhir | fi nal; con temporary tabiʿa tr., ittabaʿa tr. | to follow s.th.\nor s.o. ʿabada tr. | to serve s.o. or s.th., to worship s.o. or s.th. daʿā tr. | to call\nupon s.o. mansak | rite\nMillah in the Qur’an. Th ere are two Qur’anic terms that approximate the modern concept\nof “religion,” dīn and millah. The former is dealt with elsewhere (→ dīn2). As for millah,\nit appears in two main contexts. First, a string of verses speaks of millat ibrāhīm, “the\nmillah of Abraham” (Q 2:130.135, 3:95, 4:125, 6:161, 16:123; 22:78 has “the millah of your\nfather Abraham”; → ab). These passages are mostly Medinan, although it remains to be\nascertained whether Q 6:161 and 16:123 are integral to the Meccan surahs containing them\n11 There is also the opening verse of a poem attributed to al- Khansāʾ: “Nothing endures except for the face\nof our king” (lā shayʾa yabqā ghayra wajhi malīkinā; Cheikho 1896, 48). Its pertinence could certainly be ques-\ntioned on account of its similarity to the Qur’anic statement that “the face of your glorious and venerable Lord\nwill endure” (Q 55:27: wa- yabqā wajhu rabbika dhū l- jalāli wa- l- ikrām). On the other hand, a poem attributed\nto ʿAdī ibn Zayd similarly asserts the per sis tence of God’s “face”: “Nothing endures against doom (al- manūn)\nexcept for the face of the praiseworthy creator” (al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 92:1). The terminological concatenation\nof wajh and baqiya with regard to God may consequently be a genuinely pre- Qur’anic motif; Brockelmann\naccordingly denies that the line attributed to al-K hansāʾ can be summarily dismissed as a mere restatement of\nQ 55:27 (Brockelmann 1922, 108).\nmillah 645", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

However\nAbraham’s millah is to be construed in precise terms, it appears to be closely bound up\nwith his unbending commitment to mono the ism.\nThe second principal group of millah verses are a number of Meccan passages referring\nto the millah of collectives who are presented as opposed to the Qur’an’s own theology. For\ninstance, according to Q 38:2–7— which judging by Surah 38’s relatively low mean verse\nlength (HCI 115) has an excellent claim to being the earliest Qur’anic occurrence of the word\nmillah—t he notables (v. 6: → al- malaʾ) among the “repudiators” (vv. 2.4: alladhīna kafarū,\nal- kāfirūn) protest that the Qur’anic Messenger “makes the gods into one god” (v. 5: jaʿala\nl- ālihata ilāhan wāḥidan) and that this is something unheard of “in the con temporary mil-\nlah” (v. 7: mā samiʿnā bi- hādhā fī l- millati l- ākhirati).2 The “cont emporary” or “last millah”\nhere is sometimes taken to refer to Chris tian ity (see, e.g., the traditions collected in Ṭab.\n20:21–22 or Andrae 1932, 98). Yet the alternative view that the “con temporary millah” is\nthe religion of Quraysh (Ṭab. 20:22–23) is undoubtedly preferable, as the passage’s con-\ntext strongly suggests that the millah in question is the one to which the notables adhere\nthemselves. Approximations like “cont emporary religious teaching” or “cont emporary\nreligious belief” would seem to do justice to the expression’s contextual purport, see-\ning that the disagreement concerns the conflict between the Messenger’s insistence that\nthere is only a single deity (v. 5) and his opponents’ devotion to a plurality of gods (v. 6).3\nElsewhere, too, the word millah describes the religious orientation of t hose who reject\nthe preaching of God’s messengers or of those from whom the pious “Companions of the\nCave,” whose story is told in Surah 18, are hiding: Q 7:88–89, 14:13, and 18:20 all evoke\nthe threat or, depending on the speaker, the fear that believers or divinely commissioned\nmessengers will be forced to “return” (ʿ- w- d) to the millah of their adversaries. It is worth\nhighlighting that in all these latter verses, millah carries a possessive pronoun in the plural\n(fī millatinā/millatikum/millatihim). The Medinan verse Q 2:120, according to which “the\nJews and Christians will not be satisfied with youS until you follow their millah,” builds on\nthese Meccan references to the millah of religious adversaries.\n1 Neuwirth considers Q 6:161 to be a Medinan addition and contemplates that the same might apply to\n16:123 (Neuwirth 2016b, 195). Th ere are certainly Medinan insertions in the vicinity of the latter verse, namely,\nQ 16:114–115.118 (Sinai 2019c, 130–131; see also Neuwirth 2007, 301).\n2 The standard Qur’anic antonym of ākhir is awwal (e.g., 56:49, 57:3, 79:25, 92:13). In accordance with the literal\nmeaning of awwal, “first,” it can mean “primordial” or “ancient,” as in → ˻asāṭīr al- awwalīn, “writs of the ancients”\n(e.g., Q 6:25, 8:31, 16:24, 83:13), while the literal meaning of → ākhir is “final.” But on occasion, e ither term appears\nto function merely as the negation of the other one. Thus, when Q 28:70, 53:25, 79:25, 92:13, and 93:4 describe the\npre- eschatological world as al-ū lā, in contrast to al-ā khirah, the point must be that the pre sent world is non-fi nal,\nrather than to pre sent it as primordial; a fter all, it is God who is, strictly speaking, al- awwal (Q 57:3). Similarly, when\nQ 38:7 speaks of al- millah al-ā khirah, we should prob ably understand ākhirah to mean simply “non-a ncient,” “non-\nprimordial”: the point is not that the millah at hand is the final one, but simply that it is cont emporary or recent.\n3 The preceding does not entail that Meccan paganism was predominantly a matter of belief rather than of\nritual practice. However, the fact that the existence or non- existence of deities other than Allāh could become\nsuch a source of heated controversy between the Qur’anic community and their pagan contemporaries surely\ndemonstrates that Qurashī paganism involved at least some commitments that are appropriately described as\ndoctrinal. If the take on millah developed in the pre sent entry is correct, then the term’s application to Meccan\nreligion picked out t hese doctrinal components, even though they may well have been secondary to ritual aspects.\n646 millah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In v. 37, Joseph declares that he is forsaking “the millah of\na people who do not believe in God and who repudiate the hereafter” (innī taraktu millata\nqawmin lā yuʾminūna bi- llāhi wa- hum bi- l-ā khirati hum kāfirūn), employing millah with\nreference to the religious orientation of those rejecting mono the ism. Joseph then contin-\nues by affirming, in v. 38, that he is instead following “the millah of my f athers Abraham,\nIsaac, and Jacob; it does not befit us to associate anything with God” (wa- ttabaʿtu millata\nābāʾī ibrāhīma wa- isḥāqa wa- yaʿqūba mā kāna lanā an nushrika bi- llāhi min shayʾin). Jo-\nseph’s genealogical identification of his own millah may foreshadow the more concise\nphrase millat ibrāhīm: if Q 6:161 and 16:123 r eally are Medinan insertions, then Surah 12’s\nevocation of “the millah of my fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob” would subsequently\nhave become condensed into the more succinct millat ibrāhīm. Note also that Q 12:38, like\nmost of the millat ibrāhīm verses cata logued above, mentions Abraham’s millah in close\nproximity to the root sh-r -k , describing the illicit partnering (shirk) of God with other\nbeings (→ ashraka), while Q 12:37 explic itly characterises the millah rejected by Joseph in\nterms of disbelief in God and the hereafter. Q 12:37–38 thus reinforces the impression that\nthe term millah has a strong doctrinal aspect: the diference between the millah Joseph\nrejects and the patriarchal millah he endorses hinges on the rejection of shirk and belief\nin God and the last judgement.\nMillah as “religion.” In all the verses surveyed, it would not be patently incongruous\nto translate millah as “religion,” and a number of modern scholars maintain that millah\nand dīn are more or less synonyms (GQ 1:20, n. 2; KK 30).4 A similar equation of the two\nwords is also found in the premodern exegetical tradition (e.g., al-R āghib al-I ṣfahānī 2009,\n773). The two terms nonetheless exhibit certain peculiarities of usage (see, again, al-R āghib\nal-I ṣfahānī 2009, 773). For example, dīn can appear in a genitive construction with God,\nyielding dīn allāh, “God’s religion” (Q 3:83, 24:2, 110:2), whereas the Qur’an always associ-\nates a millah with a human individual, such as Abraham, or with a human collective. Thus,\nthere is no Qur’anic attestation of millat allāh or, conversely, of dīn ibrāhīm.5 Perhaps more\nimportantly, both nouns also tend to collocate with dif ere nt verbs: millah has a noticeable\npropensity to combine with ittabaʿa, “to follow” (Q 2:120, 3:95, 4:125, 12:38, and 16:123),\nwhereas t here is only one instance in which a verbal derivative of the root t- b-ʿ governs dīn\n(Q 3:73: man tabiʿa dīnakum, “he who follows your religion”).6 By contrast, dīn frequently\noccurs in proximity to the verbs ʿabada, “to serve, to worship,” and daʿā, “to call upon,”\nand its usage in early Arabic poetry supports construing dīn specifically as religion in the\nsense of communal practices (→ dīn2). Just as the meaning of millah seems to pivot on the\n4 The position put forward in GMK 228–229 is more nuanced: on the one hand, Izutsu concedes that the\ntwo terms may sometimes be employed synonymously; yet on the other hand, he posits that millah focuses on\nreligion as an objective communal real ity (“a formal system of creeds and rituals which constitutes the princi ple\nof unity for a par tic u lar religious community and works as the basis of its social life”; GMK 228) while dīn can\nmean religion as personal faith (GMK 226–229). But the latter claim is questionable (see under → dīn2); and as\nI argue in the main text, the Qur’anic usage of millah tends to pick out specifically the credal or doctrinal aspect\nof religion, while its ritual dimension is more obviously bound up with the term dīn.\n5 But note that dīn and millah both share the characteristic of combining with possessive suffixes that refer\nto humans (for dīn, see, e.g., Q 2:217, 3:24.73, 5:54.77, 40:26, 49:16, 109:6; for millah, see the occurrences of fī\nmillatinā/millatikum/millatihim noted above).\n6 Wilfred Cantwell Smith notes that in every case in which the Qur’an uses the word millah, “the reference\nis to someone following the millah of someone e lse” (Smith 1991, 294). Although not all occurrences of the word\nare explic itly governed by the verb ittabaʿa, this is a valid thematic generalisation.\nmillah 647", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

At the risk of\nimposing too neat a distinction, it is tempting to propose that dīn is primarily religion qua\nsomething that is done while millah is primarily religion qua something that is believed. As\nwe s hall see below, the putative etymology of the word millah helps understand how this\nsemantic state of afairs may have come about.\nDespite the preceding suggestion, however, one must not overlook that the fig-\nure of Abraham— whose millah is mentioned in a number of Qur’anic verses (see also\nunder → ḥanīf)—is associated not only with mono the istic belief but also with concrete\nritual practices, specifically, with the pilgrimage rites linked to the Meccan Kaʿbah (e.g.,\nQ 22:26–29; see under → ḥajja). Accordingly, the reference to Abraham’s millah in Q 2:130\nfollows directly upon a passage in which Abraham and his son Ishmael not only pray that\ntheir descendants might surrender themselves to God but also ask God to “show us our\nrites” (singular: mansak, on which see u nder → dhabaḥa; Q 2:128). Th ese rites are presum-\nably the cultic practices to be performed at the Meccan sanctuary, whose foundation at\nthe hands of Abraham and Ishmael is recounted in Q 2:127. Hence, when Q 2:130 extols the\nmillah of Abraham, it is contextually pos si ble that the latter evokes not only mono the istic\nbelief but also the faithful adherence to certain rituals linked to the Meccan sanctuary that\nGod is assumed to have taught to Abraham. If this is correct, then the degree to which dīn\nand millah foreground dif ere nt dimensions of human religiosity should not be overstated.\nAfter all, it is clear that the Qur’an generally supposes that right belief is closely linked with\ncertain behavioural manifestations, such as prayer and almsgiving (see u nder → āmana).\nThis general perspective explains why a verse like Q 6:161 would seem to establish such a\nclose link between dīn and millah (GMK 229): “Say, ‘My Lord has guided me to a straight\nroad—by way of a right dīn (dīnan qiyaman), the millah of Abraham, fervently devoted\nto worshipping God (millata ibrāhīma ḥanīfan); he did not belong to the associators (wa-\nmā kāna mina l- mushrikīn).” Two other verses that combine a reference to the millah of\nAbraham with the word dīn are Q 4:125 and 22:78, thus reinforcing the impression that in\ntheir Qur’anic usage the two terms are at least on a path to synonymity.\nCognate terminology in Christian and Jewish usage. Having thus ascertained the broad\ncontours of how the word millah functions in the Qur’an, we may turn to the question of its\nprovenance, which w ill also help to refine our understanding of the word further. As e arlier\nscholars have noted (BEḲ 44; GQ 1:146, n. 3; NB 25–26; KU 62–63; FVQ 268–269), it is\netymologically likely that Arabic millah is descended from Syriac melltā (SL 775) or Jewish\nAramaic milta (DJBA 668–669; DJPA 305), both of which have the basic meaning “word”\n(and also, in Syriac, “the Word” = ho log os). Jefery asserts that milta can be “used figura-\ntively for the religious beliefs of a person” and that melltā is “used technically for religion”\n(FVQ 268–269), but he fails to produce any evidence in support of this. In fact, Nöldeke\nand Horovitz expressly remark on the discrepancy between the meaning of the Qur’anic\nterm and its likely Syriac pred ec es sor (GQ 1:146, n. 3; NB 25–26; KU 62–63).\nA Syriac usage that exhibits pertinent resemblance to the Qur’anic one is however iden-\ntified by Ahrens. He observes that three places in Acts remark on the spread of “God’s word”\n(ho log os tou theou, Peshitta: mellteh d- allāhā) or “the word,” h ere meaning the Christian\nmessage (Acts 6:7, 8:4.14; CQ 33). In fact, further New Testamental prooftexts can be added.\nFor instance, Acts 2:41 reports that some of Peter’s hearers “eagerly received his word\n(ton logon autou, mellteh) and believed and w ere baptised.” The statement is noteworthy\n648 millah", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, Luke 5:1 describes how\na crowd was pressing in on Jesus “to hear the word of God (ton logon tou theou, Peshitta:\nmelltā d- allāhā),” while in 1 Thess 2:13 Paul thanks God for the fact that when his readers\n“received the word of God that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a h uman word\nbut as what it r eally is, God’s word (logon theou, Peshitta: melltā d- allāhā), which is also at\nwork in you believers.”8 Ahrens also points out that elsewhere in Acts, Greek ho log os tou\ntheou or tou kyriou ho log os are rendered as sbartā d- allāhā, “God’s gospel” (Acts 12:24), or\nhaymānūteh d- allāhā, “God’s faith” (Acts 19:20). This reinforces the impression that Syriac\nmelltā can refer to a religious kerygma or teaching. Moving beyond the New Testament,\none may point to a statement at the end of the biography of Narsai in Barḥadhbәshabbā’s\nEcclesiastical History, according to which Narsai would not quickly “grow weary from didac-\ntic discourse” (melltā d- mallpānūtā; see Becker 2008, 85, and for the Syriac Nau 1913, 630,\nl. 8). That the usage seen in Acts continued in subsequent Christian discourse is demon-\nstrated by the Syriac version of the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius, according to which\nthe Christians who w ere scattered abroad a fter the martyrdom of Stephanus “did not yet\ndare proclaim God’s word to the gentiles” (Wright and McLean 1898, 62, l. 9 = book 2:1:8;\nthe Greek original has tou tēs pisteōs metadidonai logou; see Eusebius 1926–1932, 1:106–107).\nThe Syriac Didascalia Apostolorum too refers to “him who speaks to you (mmallel lāk) the\nword of God (melltā d- allāha)” (Vööbus 1979, 37, l. 5).\nFrom Syriac melltā to Arabic millah. In sum, t here is good evidence that Syriac melltā\ncan mean kerygmatic or didactic religious discourse. As we saw above, the Qur’anic term\nmillat ibrāhīm may similarly be understood to refer to a patriarchal religious teaching.\nHence, the Syriac cognate of millah, used to refer to the Christian teaching, does indeed\nform a credible precursor.9 It is in any case entirely conceivable that Arabic millah under-\nwent an in de pen dent semantic development that diverged from the meaning or meanings\nof its ancestor term.10 Unfortunately, no credible occurrences of millah in pre- Islamic\npoetry have yet been identified.11 Still, the possibility that the Qur’anic employment of\nmillah reflects semantic developments that precede Muhammad should not be ruled out\n7 For the contrasting usage, see, e.g., Acts 19:10, which has ton logon tou kyriou = melltā d- māryā, or Acts\n4:4.29.31, 6:2.4, and 8:25, as well as some of the quotations that follow in the main text.\n8 Melltā d- allāhā can also render Greek rhēma theou, as in Luke 3:2, where it refers to the divine call received\nby John the Baptist (see further TDNT 4:113 and 4:116–117).\n9 Juan Cole associates Qur’anic millah with melltā in the sense of a cosmic or metaphysical divine log-\nos, whom Christians identified with Christ (Cole 2019, 409–410). This strikes me as unwarranted in light of\nQur’anic usage.\n10 A hy po thet i cal Manichaean usage is surmised in BeDuhn 2015, 271, who proposes that Mani may have\nemployed Aramaic milta/melta “in his discussion of vari ous ‘religions,’ where his translators used dēn or nomos\nor ekklēsia.”\n11 Horovitz points out that the term millat allāh does appear in some poetry cited in Ibn Hishām’s sīrah (KU\n63), but the authenticity of the sīrah’s poetry is too uncertain in order to adopt a default attitude of considering\nit to be con temporary with Muhammad. However, if it were pos si ble to pinpoint an occurrence of millat allāh\nin poetry credibly dated to the first Islamic de cades, this would at least provide circumstantial evidence that the\nterm was current in the pre- Qur’anic period: given that it does not appear in the Qur’an, its potential usage in\nearly poetry would not be explicable as a mere imitation of Qur’anic diction.\nmillah 649", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

One might speculate that Arabophone Christians could have rendered\n“God’s word” (Greek: ho log os tou theou, Syriac: melltā d- allāhā), in the sense of the Chris-\ntian message, as millat allāh, even if this latter phrase is not attested in the Qur’an. This\nmay have led to Arabic millah acquiring the general meaning “religious teaching, religious\ndoctrine,” as inferable from the Qur’an. Positing that the developmental step leading from\na conjectured Christian phrase millat allāh to a general acceptation of millah = “religious\nteaching” preceded the Qur’an would help explain the fact that the Qur’an does not ex-\nclusively associate the term millah with Biblically based mono the ists but also attributes a\nmillah to its pagan opponents.\nAn alternative account: millah and Hebrew milah, “circumcision”? An alternative\nderivation of the Qur’anic word millah has been proposed by Angelika Neuwirth (Neu-\nwirth 2016b, 195; Neuwirth 2017, 540–541), who would trace the word back to milah,\n“circumcision,” in rabbinic Hebrew (DTTM 774). Given that the etiology of the ritual of\ncircumcision is intimately associated with Abraham (Gen 17), Neuwirth’s conjecture tal-\nlies well with Medinan references to the millat ibrāhīm. The hypothesis nonetheless fails\nin view of the fact that the Qur’an refers to a millah not only of the Jews but also of the\nChristians (Q 2:120) and furthermore attributes a millah to those who resist the Qur’anic\ndoctrine of radical mono the ism and eschatological piety. An additional difficulty consists\nin the absence of any unequivocal Qur’anic reference to the ritual of circumcision. Fi nally,\nthe verb ittabaʿa, “to follow,” which takes millah or millat ibrāhīm as its object in several\nverses, is not suggestive of the per for mance of circumcision.\nmamnūn: ghayr ~ | rightfully earned\n→ ajr\numniyyah | wish\n→ ummī\nmanāt | Manāt\n→ ashraka\nmahada tr./intr. | to spread (s.th.) out\nmahd, mihād | s.th. spread out\n→ arḍ, → khalaqa\nmāʾ | w ater\n→ khalaqa\namāta tr./intr. | to cause (s.o.) to die\n→ aḥyā\n650 mamnūn", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

While the primary\nQur’anic title for Muhammad is “God’s Messenger” (rasūl allāh) or simply “the Messenger”\n(→ rasūl), another impor tant epithet applied to him, almost exclusively in Medinan texts\n(see already BEḲ 42), is al- nabiyy, “the Prophet” (e.g., Q 5:81, 8:64.65.70, 9:61.73.113.117,\n33:1.6.13.28.30 etc.). Nabiyy is patently an Arabisation of Hebrew nābîʾ, Aramaic/Syriac\nnbīyā, or Ethiopic nabiyy (BEḲ 42–43; KU 47; FVQ 276). Given this link, it is all the more\nstriking that almost none of the major “written” prophets of the Hebrew Bible, such as\nIsaiah, Jeremiah, or Ezekiel, figure as Qur’anic prophets, or even figure at all in the Qur’an,\nthe single exception being Jonah (Wensinck 1924, 169–170; O’Connor 2019, 199–200).1\n1 But note that some passages do assume the existence of Israelite prophets as a collective (al-n abiyyīn,\nal- anbiyāʾ, anbiyāʾ allāh): Q 2:61.91, 3:21.112.181, 4:155. That t hese Israelite prophets are not identical with t hose\nIsraelite personalities who are expressly named as prophets, such as David or Solomon (see below), is clear from\nthe fact that the pertinent verses accuse the Israelites of killing the prophets in question, a claim never repeated\n(and unlikely to have been tacitly presupposed) with regard to David, Salomon, etc.\n652", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is true that the traditional lexicog-\nraphers’ inner-A rabic derivation of the Qur’anic term directly from the root n- b-ʾ ignores\nthe strong likelihood that we are dealing with a loanword. Yet the association of nabiyy\nwith the root n- b-ʾ may be quite early, in so far as it accords with the reading variant nabīʾ\ninstead of nabiyy, attributed to Nāfiʿ (see, e.g., MQQ 1:65 and MQ 1:115 on Q 2:61, and MQQ\n1:191 and MQ 1:348 on Q 2:247), which has been classed as an archaism (van Putten 2022,\n171–173). Moreover, some Qur’anic verses employ the verb nabbaʾa (“to announce, to tell”)\nand the noun nabaʾ (“announcement, tiding”) to refer to acts of prophetic proclamation\nor the contents thereof (Bijlefeld 1969, 11 and 15; Ahrens 1935, 128)—an observation that\nis consistent with the hypothesis that an assumed link between nabiyy and n- b-ʾ was op-\nerative already among the Qur’an’s original addressees. Thus, in Q 78:2, al- nabaʾ al-ʿ aẓīm,\n“the mighty tidings,” refers to the eschatological judgement; in Q 26:69, Muhammad is\ninstructed to recount “the tidings of Abraham” (nabaʾ ibrāhīm); in Q 15:49.51, he is com-\nmanded to “announce” (nabbiʾ) that God is compassionate and merciful and to “tell them”\n(nabbiʾhum) about the angelic guests of Abraham; and Q 34:7 describes Muhammad as\n“a man telling youp (yunabbiʾukum) that, when you have been completely torn to pieces,\nyou w ill be created anew.” One of the connotations that Muhammad’s hearers would have\nconnected with the title nabiyy may therefore well have been that of a divinely empowered\n“teller” or “tidings- bearer,” roughly in keeping with a l ater lexicographer’s statement that a\nnabiyy is called such because “he gives tidings of God” (anbaʾa ʿani llāhi taʿālā; al- Jawharī\n1979, 74). The fact that the Qur’anic text has been shown to display a general awareness\nof etymological connections (el Masri 2020, 29–31 and elsewhere) adds to the cogency of\nthe suggestion just made.2\nNabiyy vs rasūl. Many Qur’anic protagonists, such as Noah, Abraham, Moses, or Jesus\nare termed both a nabiyy, “prophet,” and a rasūl, “messenger.”3 Nonetheless, traditional\nMuslim exegesis maintains that the two words are not in fact synonymous (Bijlefeld 1969,\n12–14; O’Connor 2019, 205–206). Prophecy is generally understood to constitute the wider\ncategory of the two and is linked with the receipt of a religious law, while messengership is\nassociated with public preaching. W hether this par tic ul ar way of framing the distinction is\nfully borne out by the Qur’anic data is questionable; but one may nonetheless observe some\nsalient patterns in the way the term nabiyy tends to be employed that distinguish it from\nthe Qur’anic usage of rasūl, even if some exceptions w ill have to be noted further below.\nThe issue is also treated in much more detail in a recent dissertation by Andrew O’Connor\n(O’Connor 2019) that should be consulted alongside the pre sent entry.\n(i) First, in a significant number of passages the word “prophet” is conspicuously\nconfined to figures of Biblical or Israelite history (KU 48). A good illustration for this tendency\nis Surah 19, in the course of which the following figures are labelled prophets: Jesus\n2 This is not to say that inner- Arabic etymologisation will be indiscriminately appropriate. For instance,\nit is doubtful whether Jesus’s title → al- masīḥ, “the Christ,” is Qur’anically understood to derive from the verb\nmasaḥa rather than being taken as a quasi- surname.\n3 According to Bijlefeld 1969, 17, Abraham is only designated as a prophet; but as he l ater acknowledges,\nQ 9:70 seems to imply that he was a messenger, too (Bijlefeld 1969, 26, n. 110). This is in keeping with the fact\nthat Abraham’s biography as retold in the Qur’an conforms in many re spects to the standard ele ments of a\nQur’anic rasūl narrative.\nnabiyy 653", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Moreover, Medinan verses accuse the\nIsraelites of “killing the prophets” (Q 2:61.91, 3:21.112.181, 4:155; see Reynolds 2012), further\nbearing out a close link between prophecy and the Israelites.6 Fin ally, while some of the\nmost impor tant Qur’anic heroes are envisaged both as prophets and as messengers, it is\nnoteworthy that at least some of the figures just referenced are never said to be messengers,\nnamely, Isaac, Jacob, Job, David, Solomon, Zechariah, John (the Baptist), and Idrīs (for a\nhelpful table, see O’Connor 2019, 204).7\n(ii) Complementing the previous point, it is stated that prophecy runs in family lines,\nby way of being a hallmark of the descendants or “ofspring” (dhurriyyah) of Adam, Noah,\nand Abraham (Q 19:58, 29:27, 57:26). In so far as Adam, Noah, Abraham, and Mary’s f ather\nʿImrān are “descendants of one another” (dhurriyyatan baʿḍuhā min baʿḍin; Q 3:34), the\nphenomenon of prophecy emerges as genealogically tied to one par tic u lar strand of hu-\nmanity, namely, the Israelites and their patriarchs (see Bijlefeld 1969, 17, 18, 25, and also\nDurie 2018, 133). This genealogical aspect of prophecy is not disrupted by the fact that\nMedinan passages cast Muhammad as a prophet, for Q 14:37 depicts the Meccans (and\ntherefore also Muhammad) as Abrahamites.\n(iii) From early on, Muhammad is categorised as a messenger (see Q 21:25, 25:7.27.30,\n44:13, 69:40),8 even if this is not pervasive and it is only in the Medinan period that he\n4 This assumption would be strengthened if the name is ultimately to be derived, via Syriac, from the Greek\nname Andreas (JPND 175–176; FVQ 51–52).\n5 The verse belongs to a Medinan insertion; see HCI 94–95.\n6 However, Q 2:87, 3:183, and 5:70 make the same accusation by using rasūl/rusul; see further below.\n7 This is well expressed by Bijlefeld 1969, 17: “ ‘Not every prophet is an apostle’ is indeed a thesis which has\nfull Qurʾanic support.” O’Connor countenances the possibility that Q 4:164 might implicitly apply the title of\nmessengers to the Biblical figures listed in the previous verse, which include David and Solomon (O’Connor\n2019, 204). However, it is entirely conceivable, and arguably preferable, to consider Q 4:163–165 to rest on a\ndistinction between prophets and messengers: v. 163 asserts that God has granted revelatory inspirations to a\ncertain list of prophets, including David and Solomon, while v. 164 then adds that God has also made revelations\nto certain “messengers whom we told youS about before (min qablu) and messengers whom we have not told you\nabout.” Especially in view of the phrase min qablu, which is best construed as referring to chronologically prior\nQur’anic texts, it seems more likely that the messengers referred to in vv. 164–165 are a dif er ent group of p eople\nthan the prophets listed in v. 163. For the opposite construal, taking prophets and messengers to be synonymous\nhere, see O’Connor 2019, 209, n. 67.\n8 On Q 69:40, see n. 28 under → malak.\n654 nabiyy", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

By contrast, the Meccan surahs virtually never\ncall him a nabiyy, although two passages, Q 6:112 and 25:31, imply that the opposition\nencountered by him links him to previous prophets (Bijlefeld 1969, 15).9 As noted above,\nit is only in Medinan surahs that Muhammad is routinely called a “prophet,” and one\nMedinan verse, Q 33:40, even elevates him to the rank of the “seal of the prophets”\n(khātam al-n abiyyīn), likely implying the finality of Muhammad’s prophetic mission (see\nunder → khatama). Muhammad’s status as a prophet thus emerges only very gradually\nover the course of the Qur’an’s emergence, whereas his status as a messenger is established\nat a much earlier point.\n(iv) Some of the customary Qur’anic tropes that adhere to the term rasūl are noticeably\nabsent in connection with the term nabiyy. For instance, messengership is understood to be\nan emphatically ecumenical phenomenon: every community (ummah) has its messenger\nwho comes to deliver a final warning before God unleashes his devastating punishment (see\nunder → rasūl). Even though Q 7:94 does say something similar about prophets (“We have\nnot sent any prophet to a settlement without seizing its inhabitants with misery and hard-\nship”), making prophets appear functionally equivalent to messengers, such statements are\nnot other wise found about prophets in the Qur’an (Bijlefeld 1969, 20). Secondly, explicit\ncalls to obedience are always coupled with Muhammad qua messenger, not qua prophet\n(Bijlefeld 1969, 22).10 Thirdly, while it is categorically stated that God w ill “deliver” (verb:\nnajjā) and “aid” (n-ṣ - r) his messengers (Q 6:34, 10:103, 12:110, 40:51; see also 2:214 and\n30:47), prophets who, unlike Noah and Abraham, are not si mul ta neously messengers can\napparently be killed by their opponents, at least according to a string of Medinan verses\nthat accuse the Israelites and the scripture- owners of d oing so (Q 2:61.87.91, 3:21.112.181.183,\n4:155, 5:70, on which see Reynolds 2012). By contrast, the Qur’an conveys the overall\nimpression that messengers “must triumph in order to manifest on earth the triumph of\nGod” (Bijlefeld 1969, 22).11\nThe preceding generalisations are nonetheless disrupted by individual verses evidenc-\ning a partial conflation of the concepts of the prophet and the messenger in the Qur’an\n(O’Connor 2019, 207–210; but see already Wensinck 1924, 172). A prime exhibit in this\nregard is Q 7:94, which opens a verse group ofering concluding comments on the narrative\ncycle occupying vv. 59–93 of the surah. First, as already highlighted, v. 94 pre sents the role\nof a prophet in terms that are other wise typical of messengers, and indeed a later verse in\nthe same concluding passage shifts back to speaking of the “messengers” that have come\nto the settlements destroyed by God (v. 101, noted in O’Connor 2019, 208). Secondly, the\nnarrative cycle preceding v. 94 features not only Noah and Lot but also Hūd, Ṣāliḥ, and\nShuʿayb; in so far as v. 94 makes a general statement about God’s sending of prophets, it\nanomalously, but undeniably, suggests that Hūd, Ṣāliḥ, and Shuʿayb fall u nder the category\nof prophecy as well (O’Connor 2019, 207–208), thereby contradicting Horovitz’s claim\nthat the Arabian figures Hūd, Ṣāliḥ, and Shuʿayb are never categorised as prophets (KU 48;\nsee also Watt 1970, 28, and Durie 2018, 132). Other verses in which O’Connor has plausibly\ndetected an assimilation of the concept of the prophet to that of the messenger are Q 2:213,\n9 Both verses overlap in stating that God has “appointed an e nemy for e very prophet” (jaʿalnā li- kulli nabiyyin\nʿaduwwan).\n10 The only verse that has both nabiyy and the verb aṭāʿa is Q 33:1, but h ere it is Muhammad—a ddressed by\n“O Prophet”— who is commanded not to obey the repudiators.\n11 On Q 2:87, 3:183, and 5:70, which speak of a killing of messengers rather than prophets, see below.\nnabiyy 655", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

And even in Surah 19, one of the foremost corroborating texts in favour of a\nclose link between the Qur’anic notion of prophecy and Israelite history, two verses pair\nthe terms nabiyy and rasūl as double epithets, giving the impression of substantial seman-\ntic overlap: of both Moses and Ishmael it is said that “he was a messenger, a prophet”\n(wa- kāna rasūlan nabiyyā; vv. 51 and 54). A similar sense can be gleaned from Q 25:31,\nalready adduced as a rare Meccan suggestion to the efect that Muhammad’s experience of\nopposition conforms to the category of prophecy: after the preceding verse reports how\n“the messenger”— most likely, Muhammad— will on the day of judgement complain that\nhis people have shunned “this qurʾān,” v. 31 then shifts to the term nabiyy: “Thus have we\nappointed an e nemy from among the evildoers for e very prophet” (jaʿalnā li- kulli nabiyyin\nʿaduwwan). Q 43:6–7, too, pre sents the function of a nabiyy in terms reminiscent of a rasūl\n(O’Connor 2019, 214).12 Fi nally, in Q 2:87, 3:183, and 5:70 the accusation that the Israelites\nor the scripture- owners are guilty of killing God’s prophets (cf. 2:61.91, 3:21.112.181, 4:155)\nis varied to the charge of killing God’s messengers.\nSome degree of conflation of the category of the prophet with that of the messenger, or\nperhaps the operation of a mutual force of conceptual attraction between them, is therefore\nundeniable. Yet the observations collated u nder (i) through (iv) above, even if muddied by\nsome exceptions, seem solid enough to enable us to discern a Qur’anic concept of proph-\necy that is distinct from that of messengership. Prophecy is a multi- generational divine\nengagement with one par tic u lar strand of humanity, the Israelites and their patriarchs,\nwhereas messengership is a universal human phenomenon generating moments of crisis:\nany community that is in flagrant breach of its religious and ethical obligations will be sent\na warner before God will unleash his punishment, with the messenger’s coming forcing\n“a split into two opposing factions, one rejecting him and his message, the other accepting\nhim in faith and obedience” (Bijlefeld 1969, 26). A particularly int er est ing manifestation\nof the presuppositions attaching to the concept of prophecy is Q 7:157–158, a Medinan\ninsertion describing Muhammad as “the prophet of the scriptureless” (al- nabiyy al- ummī),\nwhose ministry marks the extension of prophecy beyond the Israelites and their descen-\ndants, the Jewish and Christian “scripture- owners” or ahl al- kitāb (see under → ummī).\nThe point of such a statement would be difficult to understand had there not been, in line\nwith (i) above, a tacit assumption that prophecy was hitherto the prerogative of the ahl\nal- kitāb. Once again, however, one encounters a tendency for the concepts of prophecy\nand messengership to exercise semantic attraction upon each other, since Q 62:2 makes\na very similar claim to 7:157–158 by employing the term rasūl rather than nabiyy: God has\nsent “among the scriptureless (fī l- ummiyyīna) a messenger from among them (minhum),\nwho w ill recount his signs to them (yatlū ʿalayhim āyātihi) and purify them and teach them\nthe scripture and wisdom, even if they were previously in manifest error.” We are here\nfaced with a confluence of both concepts in the person of Muhammad: the reference to the\nrecounting of God’s signs and the emphasis on the Messenger’s hailing “from” his audience\nare standard messenger tropes (→ rasūl), while the casting of Muhammad’s audience as\n12 Cf.

To begin\nwith, the idea of human messengers of God is not only more frequent in the Meccan\nQur’an but also surfaces chronologically e arlier, as demonstrated by multiple occurrences\nthroughout Surah 26 as well as by Q 69:10.40, 73:15–16, and 91:13 (KU 48; O’Connor 2019,\n211 and 250–251). In so far as many Qur’anic prophets are also classed as messengers,\nthis time lag already goes some way to explaining the conceptual pull operating on the\nQur’anic notion of prophecy towards partial assimilation to the idea of messengership.\nSuch a confluence would have been further encouraged by the possibility of construing\nthe word nabiyy as a divinely commissioned “tidings- bearer,” as noted above. And indeed,\nof the three putatively earliest Qur’anic surahs that invoke the notion of prophecy, two\n(Q 43:6–7 and 25:31, on both of which see above) efectively employ the term nabiyy as\na synonym of rasūl.\nThe third text at hand, however, is Surah 19, which very much lays the groundwork for\nsubsequent associations of prophecy with the descendants of Abraham. This Abrahamite-\nIsraelite connotation of the concept is then consolidated in a number of later Meccan\nverses, such as Q 45:16 (the Israelites are given prophecy, al- nubuwwah), 17:55 (a general\nstatement about some prophets being preferred over others, with David as an example),\n29:27 (prophecy runs among the ofspring, dhurriyyah, of Abraham), and the cata logue of\nprophets in 6:83–89. Even so, another late Meccan verse, Q 7:94, reverts to deploying the\nterm nabiyy in a manner that seems entirely replaceable by rasūl. It may be conjectured that\nthe latent Biblical connotations inhering in the term nabiyy, perhaps due to its similarity\nwith cognate terms in Hebrew and Aramaic, are particularly likely to be sidelined when\nit figures as an object of the verb arsala, “to send,” resulting in the term nabiyy operating\nin the capacity of a near- synonym to rasūl, as in Q 7:94 and 43:6. In these cases, the fact\nthat arsala habitually collocates with rasūl or rusul (e.g., Q 2:151, 4:64.79, 5:70, 9:33, 13:38,\n14:4, 17:77, 26:27, 73:15) may conceivably have led to the semantics of r-s -l overwriting\nthose proper to the term nabiyy.\nnajas | filth\nSee under → ṭahara and also under → jāhada.\nnajjā, anjā tr. | to deliver s.o.

To “send down” (nazzala, anzala) is a frequent\nQur’anic designation for the transmission of divine revelations, a pro cess also described\nby the verb → awḥā + acc. ilā, “to convey s.th. to s.o.” or, when used intransitively, “to\nconvey revelations to s.o.” (KU 67).1 Both roots, n- z- l and w-ḥ - y, have now been the object\nof a monograph- length study that this entry has no ambition to replace (Loynes 2021).\nWhereas awḥā can on occasion be applied to communicative acts in which both parties are\nnon- divine (Q 6:112, 19:11), anzala and nazzala are confined to human- divine interaction\n(GMK 153; Wild 1996, 138). Usage of the latter two terms often collocates with the adver-\nbial phrase “from heaven,” min al-samāʾ (e.g., Q 2:22.59.164, 4:153, 5:112.114). Heaven is, of\ncourse, also where the Qur’an places God (Q 67:16–17; see Wild 1996, 141–142, and Loynes\n2021, 24). Nazzala and anzala thus designate a movement originating in the divine realm.\nIn line with this, God often features as the explicit subject of nazzala or anzala. Angels\ncan however play the role of proxy subjects mandated by God (Q 2:97, 16:102, 26:193–194,\n29:34; see Loynes 2021, 25–27), in which case nazzala, anzala, or nazala bi- (Q 26:193)\nare best translated as “to bring down.” The Qur’anic Messenger’s opponents sometimes\nchallenge him to “bring down” (tunazzil) a scripture from heaven (Q 4:153, 17:93), but\nespecially Q 17:93 makes it clear that the Qur’an rejects the view that a mere human being\nmight be capable of this (see also Q 6:93 and Loynes 2021, 28–29). In the Qur’an, initiating\ntransitive movement from heaven to earth is therefore a divine prerogative. In fact, the\nQur’an seems to consider the celestial realm to be entirely out of bounds to h umans (as\nwell as to demons, whose attempts to overhear the deliberations of the heavenly council\nare invariably thwarted; see u nder → jinn). It is true that the Qur’anic retelling of the story\nof Dhū l- Qarnayn or Alexander the G reat (Q 18:83–102) can be understood to suggest that\nthe protagonist of the narrative travelled along pathways or conduits (singular: sabab)\ntraversing the dome of the sky (see van Bladel 2007 and under → samāʾ). However, access\nto these pathways merely facilitates Dhū l- Qarnayn’s displacement from one place on the\nearth to another. As further discussed below, the Qur’an is sceptical of the possibility that\na human might ascend to the celestial realm proper and bring down a revelation.\nRecurrent objects of divine communication by means of “sending down” are revela-\ntory or quasi- revelatory phenomena such as “the scripture” (→ al-k itāb, e.g., Q 2:174.176,\n3:3, 4:105.113.140), wisdom (→ al-ḥ ikmah; Q 4:113), the corpus of recitations promulgated by\n1 I am persuaded by Simon Loynes’s argument that no clear semantic diference between anzala and nazzala\nmay be discerned in Qur’anic usage (Loynes 2021, 21–23). Some premodern Islamic scholars posit that nazzala\nhas a pro cessual connotation that anzala lacks (Seker 2019, 27–28; see, e.g., Zam. 1:526, on Q 3:3), but others\nmaintain the two verbs’ semantic equivalence (Leemhuis 1977, 21, with n. 5). In favour of the latter position,\nnote that Q 3:3 describes God’s revelations to Muhammad with the verb nazzala while Q 18:1 employs anzala.\nThe phraseology of both verses is other wise similar, in so far as both share the accusative object al- kitāb and a\nprepositional phrase with ʿalā that designates the Qur’anic Messenger, although Q 3:3 additionally involves a\nreference to earlier revelations that is absent from 18:1. For a meticulous linguistic study that seeks to establish,\nbased on a comprehensive and meticulous survey of the Qur’anic data, that t here are at least minor semantic\ndiferences between a causative verb anzala and factitive nazzala, see Leemhuis 1977, 20–36. For instance,\nLeemhuis proposes that if the object that is made to descend is “cooperative,” then an occurrence of anzala is\nmore likely than nazzala (Leemhuis 1977, 25–26). Leemhuis also adduces some examples for what he considers\nto be the durative, as opposed to momentary, character of anzala, though he admits that this is often difficult\nto verify (Leemhuis 1977, 27–29). Virtually every thing that Leemhuis says is duly hedged (e.g., Leemhuis 1977,\n36: “the borderline between factitive and causative must be seen as rather vague and overlappings may certainly\noccur”). Nonetheless, I find it difficult to resist an overall sense that his attempt to explicate why specific verses\nemploy nazzala or rather anzala is at times an exercise in ex post facto rationalisation.\nnazzala 659", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Angels (al-m alāʾikah,\nsingular: → malak), too, are among the entities sent down by God (e.g., Q 6:8.111, 15:8,\n16:2) and can act as invisible allies in battle (Q 9:26 and 33:9; see also 9:40). The things\nthat God sends down, then, are normally divine revelations or divine benefactions, al-\nthough in Q 2:59 God is said to send down “punishment” (→ rijz) “from heaven” (see\nalso Q 29:34), while Q 24:43 similarly pre sents God’s sending down of hail as potentially\nharmful (Wild 1996, 143).\nDivine descent in the early Meccan verse Q 53:13. The Qur’an’s characteristic dual\nemployment of derivatives of n- z- l to denote both revelatory and natu ral phenomena (cf.\nthe double use of anzala in Q 16:64–65) begins to coalesce already in early Meccan pas-\nsages: according to Q 78:14, God “sent down” w ater from rain clouds, while Q 97:1 speaks\nof revelatory sending down. An incipient parallelism between vertical movements in the\ndomains of nature and revelation may be discerned in Surah 53, whose opening oath evokes\nthe setting of “the star,” most likely, the Pleiades (wa- l- najmi idhā hawā; e.g., Ṭab. 22:5–7;\nsee in much more detail Hussain 2020), while subsequent verses (vv. 4–18) describe two\nvisionary experiences that are expressly described as a “descent” (v. 13: nazlah). The super-\nnatural being that is the object of these two visions, quite possibly God himself,4 is said to\nhave first been positioned high above and then to have approached the Messenger in order\nto convey revelations to him (vv. 6–10). Both the astronomical phenomenon referenced\nin the surah opening and the revelatory experience detailed thereafter thus proceed from\nheaven to earth. Hence, within its surah context the succinct allusion to the setting of a\nstar or asterism in v. 1 serves to exemplify the general possibility of vertical movement, and\ntherefore also communication, between what is above and what is below. This supports\nthe surah’s claim that the Qur’anic Messenger has indeed been privileged with the receipt\nof au then tic revelation. Although the natu ral phenomenon at hand, the setting of a star\nor asterism, is not described by a derivative of n- z- l here, the passage does foreshadow\nthe developed cosmic- revelatory parallelism that comes to be enshrined in the Qur’an’s\nmature employment of nazzala and anzala.\n2 As noted in Wild 1996, 143, references to the sending down of divine authority tend to be negative.\n3 The Qur’an contains no occurrences of the fourth- form verbal noun inzāl.\n4 In support of the contention that the object of the Messenger’s vision h ere is God rather than an angel,\nsee Sinai 2011a, 7–9, with some references to previous scholarship on the topic.

For instance, “the scripture and wisdom” (→ kitāb, → ḥikmah) are not\nonly sent down (Q 4:113), but also “given” (ātā; Q 4:54; see also 2:269, 31:12, and 38:20),\n“taught” (ʿallama; Q 2:129.151, 3:48.164, 5:110, 62:2), and “conveyed” (verb: → awḥā;\nQ 17:39, 18:27, 29:45, 35:31), while “the recitation” (→ al- qurʾān), too, is both said to be\nsent down and to be conveyed by inspiration (Q 6:19, 12:3, 20:114, 42:7).\nAs has been pointed out above, however, what sets nazzala and anzala apart from\nthese partial equivalents is a connotation of spatial descent that places God above and the\nhuman recipients of his revelations and blessings below (Wild 1996, 141–145). In divine\nacts of “sending down,” the ordinary boundary traversing the Qur’an’s two- tiered cos-\nmos composed of “the heavens and the earth” (al-s amāwāt wa-l -a rḍ; Q 2:33.107.116.117\netc.; → arḍ, → samāʾ) becomes permeable to allow for a wide- ranging array of divine in-\nterventions in the terrestrial world. On occasion, the Qur’an implies that God’s governance\nof the world involves not only descent but also ascent (verb: ʿaraja) back to God. Thus,\naccording to Q 70:4, “the angels and the spirit ascend to God” (taʿruju l-m alāʾikatu wa-l -\nrūḥu ilayhi; see under → rūḥ) on a cosmic staircase or ladder (maʿārij; Q 70:3; see JPND\n210; Horovitz 1919, 175–176; PP 438), presumably after having executed what ever tasks\nthey have been dispatched to perform below; and according to Q 32:5, God “directs [his]\ncommands (yudabbiru l- amra) from the heaven to the earth, upon which [i.e., after their\nfulfilment] they ascend [back to him] (thumma yaʿruju ilayhi)” (see u nder → amr). It is\nthus God who controls the cosmic circ uit of descent down from heaven and reascent back\nto it; God knows not only “what enters the earth and what comes forth from it” but also\n“what descends from heaven and what ascends to it” (mā yanzilu mina l- samāʾi wa- mā\nyaʿruju fīhā; Q 34:2, 57:4).\nIt is impor tant to stress that the Qur’anic God himself is generally understood to remain\nin heaven (Loynes 2021, 24–25).5 In this regard, Qur’anic theology forms a clear contrast\nwith a Christian author like Jacob of Sarug, who expressly says that God “came down\n(nḥet) from on high” (Mathews 2020, 48–51, ll. 2178–2179, 2185, 2197; cf. also Mathews\n2014, 34–35, ll. 197–198, or Kollamparampil 2010, 224–225, l. 346).6 A pos si ble exception\nto the prevalent Qur’anic scenario of God remaining above is the early Meccan verse\nQ 53:13 (see above), where the term “descent” (nazlah) may well describe a theophany,\nmeaning that reference would be to a “descent” of the deity himself. But apart from this\nexceptional passage, it is the notion of divine sending down that accounts for the possibil-\nity of divine-h uman interaction in the Qur’an, without requiring “direct and unmediated\ncontact between a human being and the deity” (Wild 1996, 146).7\nRevelatory descent vs prophetic ascent. The Qur’an’s far- reaching generalisation\nof the notion of divine sending down, ranging from rain to revelation, seems currently\nunprec ed ented, even if Aramaic renderings of the Bible— namely, the Peshitta and Targum\n5 Following Wild 1996, 141, Loynes observes that the Qur’an generally assumes a motion “of God sending\nthings down, not one of God descending.”\n6 Like Jacob, the Qur’an says that God created Adam with his hands (see Q 38:75 and u nder → allāh); but\nunlike Jacob, this is not presented as an act of divine descent or self-h umbling.\n7 Ruling out such unmediated contact would seem to be the point of Q 42:51, according to which God\nmight speak to a h uman “by [directly] conveying [revelations]” (waḥyan), or “from b ehind a veil,” or by means\nof an angelic “messenger” (rasūl), who will then pass God’s revelation on to the human addressee in question.\nnazzala 661", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is certainly not self- evident that divine revelations must necessarily\nbe conveyed in a top- down movement, given that early Jewish and Samaritan traditions\ndepict an alternative paradigm that has prophetic figures like Enoch or Moses ascend to\nheaven and receive a celestial book or at least communicate its contents to other mortals\n(Widengren 1950, 35–37 and 46; QP 119–123). The Qur’an’s opponents were demonstra-\nbly familiar with this idea of a human displacement to the heavenly realm, for they are\nquoted as demanding that Muhammad “ascend to heaven” (tarqā fī l-s amāʾi) and “bring\ndown” (an tunazzila) a scripture “upon” (ʿalā) them (Q 17:93 and similarly 4:153; QP\n122 also draws attention to Q 6:35, 15:14 with the verb ʿaraja, 38:10 with the verb irtaqā,\nand 52:38). Such notions of prophetic ascension are not endorsed by the Qur’an, and it\nis presumably in disagreement with them that the Qur’anic proclamations are adamant\nthat scriptural revelations are invariably “sent down” by God (Fossum 1993, 157–158; see\nalso QP 123).8 The disparity between the Qur’anic paradigm of revelatory descent and\nthe alternative one of prophetic ascent is even clearer if one accepts Angelika Neuwirth’s\nargument that Q 17:1 does not assert an ascent of the Qur’anic Messenger to heaven, along\nthe lines of the later Islamic miʿrāj tradition but merely Muhammad’s translocation to\nthe site of the Jerusalem temple (SPMC 227–233, 239).9 The contrast between these two\nopposing paradigms— one of divine revelations travelling downwards, the other one of\nhumans travelling upwards—is thrown into linguistic relief by the fact that in the Qur’an’s\nown voice it is generally God who figures as the grammatical subject of the verbs nazzala\nand anzala, while in the opponents’ challenges in Q 4:153 and 17:93 the subject of nazzala\nis the Qur’anic Messenger. The general theological upshot of the Qur’anic paradigm of\nrevelatory descent is that agency in the pro cess of revelation is fully confined to the deity\n(QP 122): “The overall message is that the only way in which humans can gain divine\nknowledge is by God sending it down.”\nIs God’s sending down of the scripture equivalent to its conveyance to humans?\nIt is usually assumed that when the Qur’an says that God “sent down” scripture or “the\nrecitation,” this is tantamount to the actual transmission of divine revelations to Mu-\nhammad or other human recipients (see the lit er a ture review in Loynes 2021, 2–9).\nThis supposition has recently been questioned by Simon Loynes. Through a careful\ninner- Qur’anic argument, Loynes seeks to show that the Qur’an assumes a two- stage\nmodel of the revelatory pro cess (Loynes 2021, 50–62). This two- stage scenario of rev-\nelation resembles the traditional Islamic view that at first the entirety of the Qur’anic\ncorpus was sent down to the “lowest heaven,” whence specific Qur’anic passages were\nthen transmitted to Muhammad at dif er ent times of his prophetic ministry (e.g., Ṭab.\n3:188–192). The gist of such a two- stage model is a principled distinction between an\ninitial “sending down” of the celestial scripture by virtue of which its content becomes\n“potentially available to prophets and mankind” (Loynes 2021, 50), and the subsequent\ncommunication of specific parts of this sent- down scripture to Muhammad or some\nother prophet, by virtue of which the celestial scripture becomes actually available to\nh uman addressees.\n8 As noted earlier, Dhū l- Qarnayn seems to be portrayed as travelling along heavenly conduits or “cords”;\nbut he does not bring down a revelation.\n9 For two alternative voices, see Busse 1991 and Fossum 1993, 157.\n662 nazzala", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Most importantly, a considerable number\nof verses addressing the Qur’anic Messenger collocate anzala/nazzala + kitāb or qurʾān\nwith ʿalayka, “upon youS,” or ilayka, “to youS.”10 Thus, at Q 25:32 the Qur’anic opponents\nare alleged to pose the question, “Why has the recitation not been sent down upon him\n(law- lā nuzzila ʿalayhi l- qurʾānu) as a single w hole (jumlatan wāḥidatan)?’ ” It seems safe\nto infer from this that God’s sending down of the Qur’anic corpus is identical with, rather\nthan merely a precondition for, the act of conveying revelations to a specific human ad-\ndressee. Sending down, in other word, is not envisaged as a one- of event that prepares the\nground for the a ctual transmission of revelations at a subsequent point in time but rather\nas an ongoing pro cess involving the actual, albeit incremental, delivery of consecutive\nrevelatory instalments to the Qur’anic Messenger.\nThe claim that the sending down of the Qur’anic revelations is envisaged as an ongoing\npro cess is not refuted by the fact that many references to God’s sending down of revelations\nemploy perfect forms of the verbs anzala and nazzala (e.g., nazzalnā or anzalnā) rather\nthan imperfect forms (such as nunazzilu, as in Q 17:82). The perfect also occurs with regard\nto God’s sending down of rain (e.g., Q 2:22, 6:99, 29:63, 43:11), which is quite obviously\nnot a one- time event but rather a recurrent phenomenon. As has been previously shown,\nthe Qur’an’s use of the perfect must not automatically be equated with employment of the\npast tense (Reuschel 1996; on the sending down of rain specifically see ibid., 155–156). A\nmuch graver difficulty for a serial or consecutive understanding of the sending down of\nthe Qur’anic revelations, and arguably the strongest evidence supporting Loynes’s two-\nstage scenario, is the fact that three Qur’anic passages from dif er ent chronological periods\nappear to date the sending down of the Qur’anic revelations, of “the clear scripture,” or\nsimply of “it” to a specific night or month (Q 2:185, 44:3, 97:1). One solution would be\nto read such statements as ingressive or inchoative, that is, to construe them as pertaining\nto the commencement of the Qur’anic revelations.\ntanazzala intr. | to descend\ntanazzala intr. bi- | to bring s.th. down\n→ amr, → jinn\nnasakha tr. | to cancel s.th. out, to abrogate s.th.\nSee briefly u nder → āyah and → qasā.\nnusuk | animal sacrifice\nmansak | rite\n→ dhabaḥa\n10 See Q 3:3.7, 4:105, 5:48, 7:2, 13:1, 14:1, 16:64.89, 20:2, 29:47.51, 38:29, 39:2.41, and 76:23; see also 6:7\nand the use of n-z -l in conjunction with ʿalā qalbika in 2:97 and 26:193–194.

A range of Qur’anic passages bemoan or presuppose\nthe h uman tendency to “forget” (nasiya) God or vital religious truths, especially the day of\njudgement (e.g., Q 9:67, 20:115.126, 25:18, 32:14, 36:78, 38:26, 39:8, 45:34). Reflecting this\nbasic assumption of Qur’anic anthropology, the communal prayer that concludes Surah 2\npleads with God not to “take us to task if we have been forgetful or have made m istakes”\n(lā tuʾākhidhnā in nasīnā aw akhṭaʾnā; Q 2:286). This discourse of human forgetfulness\nforms the negative counterpart to the Qur’an’s frequent references to human remember-\ning (→ dhakara) and divine reminding (→ dhakkara): humans being oblivious creatures,\nthey stand in permanent need of having their attention drawn to that of which they would\nother wise fail to be mindful. Some verses attribute human forgetting to the agency of the\ndevil or → shayṭān (Q 6:68, 12:42, 18:63, 58:19). This is particularly salient when Q 12:42\nis compared to its Biblical counterpart Gen 40:23, where the act of forgetting Joseph is\nattributed only to Pha raoh’s chief cupbearer rather than to any superhuman cause.1\nIn parallel with the general h uman tendency to be forgetful of God, however, the Qur’an\nalso posits that humans have an innate “creaturely disposition” (fiṭrah) towards mono the-\nism (Q 30:30; see under → ḥanīf). This presumably explains why many Qur’anic passages\nbespeak the assumption that its addressees will be, or at least ought to be, receptive to\ndivine reminders and be able to recognise assorted cosmic and historical data as “signs”\n(singular: → āyah) pointing to a unique, omnipotent, and merciful divine creator. H uman\nexistence thus plays out a conflict between two contrary dispositions or orientations,\none finding its fulfilment in turning t owards God and the other inclining h umans towards\noblivion of God. The fundamental demand imposed on every human agent is to assert\nthe former over the latter, what ever the religious milieu that he or she has contingently\nbeen born into.\nThis universal liability to be judged by the standard of rigorous mono the ism is fore-\ngrounded with par tic u lar force in the much- discussed passage Q 7:172–173 (on whose\nreception history see Gramlich 1983): every human may be regarded to have prenatally\nrecognised God as his or her Lord (rabb) and to be consequently bound by an express\npersonal commitment to mono thei sm; the fact that one’s forefathers may have worshipped\nbeings other than God w ill not count as an excuse, and no one can validly claim to have\nbeen ignorant or “heedless” (ghāfilīn) of his or her divine Lord (see u nder → rabb). While\nthe verb nasiya does not figure in this passage, it does contain the verb ghafala, which is\nclose in meaning and like nasiya recurs throughout Surah 7: just as h umans must not “forget\nthat of which they have been reminded” (Q 7:165; see also the earlier instances of nasiya\nin Q 7:51.53), so they must not neglect or “be heedless” of God’s signs (Q 7:136.146; for\n1 One verse, Q 2:106, exceptionally casts God as a cause of forgetting, though the context is very specific:\nGod may choose to “abrogate” (nasakha; see also Q 22:52) some of his signs or cause them to be forgotten; yet\nhe will unfailingly replace them by something equal or better.\n664 nasiya", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 7:205, the surah’s penultimate verse,\ncaps of its repeated allusions to remembering and forgetting by enjoining remembrance\nof God through silent invocation, employing both dhakara and ghafala in opposition:\n“invoke yourS Lord in your soul (wa-d hkur rabbaka fī nafsika), humbly and in fear, without\nraising your voice, in the mornings and in the eve nings, and do not be one of the heedless\n(wa- lā- takun mina l- ghāfilīn).”2 The core challenge with which h umans must grapple, then,\nis to keep pre sent to their minds a truth with which they are innately familiar but which\nnonetheless continually threatens to slip their minds.\nDivine forgetting. By contrast with h umans, God never forgets, as Q 19:64 and 20:52\ncategorically assert. It is only an apparent contradiction of this affirmation that a number of\nverses evoke an action- response sequence according to which h uman forgetfulness of God\nor of God’s judgement w ill entail God’s forgetting of h umans: “they have forgotten God,\nso he has forgotten them” (Q 9:67: nasū llāha fa- nasiyahum; see also 7:51, 20:126, 32:14,\n45:34).3 Such retaliatory disregarding of unbelievers and sinners is not an unwitting slip of\nmemory on God’s part but rather a deliberate consignment to oblivion, amounting to God’s\nrefusal to grant the individuals in question any further aid or forgiveness. Q 59:19 contains\na striking escalation of this action- response sequence: “Do not be like t hose who forgot\nGod, upon which he caused them to forget themselves” (wa- lā takūnū ka- lladhīna nasū\nllāha fa- ansāhum anfusahum). As explained elsewhere (→ dhakara), the Qur’an’s stress\non divine omniscience and its concomitant denial of unwitting divine forgetfulness may\nalso help explain why the Qur’an, by contrast with a significant number of pre- Qur’anic\ninscriptions, is virtually devoid of pleas that God might “remember” certain human indi-\nviduals or groups: God’s awareness of human actions and, indeed, of their secret thoughts\nand emotions is presumed to be all- encompassing and indiscriminate, though of course\nits consequences may well be punitive rather than benign.\nBiblical antecedents. The Qur’anic assessment that humans are beings essentially\ndisposed to be forgetful of God recalls Biblical statements in which forgetting God and\nhis past acts of deliverance is deemed a “willful, culpable act” (TDOT 14:673). Thus, in\nDeuteronomy the Israelites are warned against forgetting “the t hings that your eyes have\nseen” (Deut 4:9), against forgetting their covenant with God (Deut 4:23), and against\nforgetting God himself, “who brought you out of the land of Egypt” (Deut 6:12; see also\nDeut 8:14). As other verses make clear, forgetting God is equivalent to failing to keep his\ncommandments (Deut 8:11) and to worshipping other Gods (Deut 8:19). Elsewhere in\nthe Hebrew Bible, too, the Israelites are commanded to “remember and not forget” (Deut\n9:7; see also Deut 25:19) or accused of having forgotten or “not remembered” God (e.g.,\nDeut 32:18, Judg 3:7 and 8:34, 1 Sam 12:9, 2 Kgs 17:38, Ps 106:13.21). As just illustrated, in\nmany Biblical verses the crucial truth that must not be forgotten is God’s deliverance of\nthe Israelites from Egyptian servitude, his subsequent covenant with them at Sinai, and\nthe resulting obligation not to worship other deities. By contrast, some Qur’anic verses\nidentify the pivotal fact that must not slip people’s mind with the eschatological judge-\nment (Q 7:51, 32:14, 38:26, 45:34): in line with the paramount significance of eschatology\n2 The root dh- k- r is even more frequent throughout Surah 7 than nasiya and ghafala; see, e.g., Q 7:2.3.26.\n3 For similar sequences in which a human ofence is followed by a divine response in kind, see under → ma-\nkara and Q 17:8 (wa-i n ʿudtum ʿudnā).

The Qur’anic term normally equated with the Christians is al-\nnaṣārā, which is l imited to the four Medinan surahs 2, 5, 9, and 22 (Q 2:62.111.113.120.135.140,\n5:14.18.51.69.82, 9:30, 22:17), while Q 3:67 employs the corresponding singular naṣrānī.\nIn three cases (Q 2:62, 5:69, 22:17), the naṣārā appear in lists of religious communities,\ncomprising “the believers” (alladhīna āmanū), the Jews (alladhīna hādū), the enig-\nmatic → ṣābiʾūn, and— uniquely in Q 22:17—t he “Magians” (al- majūs) and the associators\n(alladhīna ashrakū; → ashraka). Other verses mention the naṣārā together with the Jews\n(al- yahūd, occasionally shortened to hūd; Q 2:111.113.120.135.140, 5:18.51.82, 9:30; cf. Griffith\n2011, 306–307; → al-y ahūd), and the Qur’an hints that t here is tension and antagonism\nbetween the naṣārā and the Jews (see especially Q 2:113).1 Q 5:47 would seem to use the\nexpression “ owners of the Gospel” (ahl al- injīl; → injīl) as a synonym for al- naṣārā (who\nare mentioned in v. 51).\nThere is no Qur’anic equivalent of the term “Christian” (nor, indeed, of the term “Jew”)\nin the Meccan period (QP 241–243).2 Nonetheless, the Meccan surahs evince considerable\nfamiliarity with aspects of Christian lore and eschatology, and the explicit disavowal of\nChristian teachings about Jesus’s divine sonship and the Trinity in the Medinan surahs is\nalready foreshadowed in some Meccan passages (Q 19:35–36, 43:59.64, and perhaps also\n21:91; for more detail, see under → rūḥ). As regards Judaism, there are Meccan references\nto the Israelites (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl), some of which even seem to locate them in the pre sent\nrather than just in the Biblical past (Q 26:197, 27:76, 46:10). Overall, it is therefore not\ntenable to take the absence of explicit references to Jews and Christians in the Meccan\nsurahs to indicate a lack of acquintance with both religions. More likely, the phenomenon\nis due to under lying polemical objectives (HCI 178).\nThe etymology and meaning of naṣārā. The fact that the naṣārā tend to be paired with\nthe Jews, are associated with the injīl, and are quoted as saying, “Christ (→ al- masīḥ) is\nGod’s son (ibn)” (Q 9:30) all accord well with the standard assumption that naṣārā is the\ngeneral Qur’anic term for Christians. Etymologically, naṣārā is likely derived from the\nSyriac plural naṣrāyē, with the Arabic singular naṣrānī being in turn a back-f ormation from\nnaṣārā (KU 144–145; FVQ 281), although a direct derivation of Arabic naṣrānī from Greek\nnazarēnos is perhaps not impossible e ither. As previous scholars have noted (e.g., KU 145;\nde Blois 2002, 1–2; Gnilka 2007, 27–34; Griffith 2011, 302–303), the adjectives nazarēnos\nand nazōraios, “of Nazareth,” are applied to Jesus at vari ous places in the New Testament\nGospels (Matt 2:23; Mark 1:24, 10:47, 14:67, 16:6; Luke 4:34, 24:19; John 19:19). The plural,\nmeanwhile, occurs in Acts 24:5, where Paul is accused of being “a ringleader of the sect of\nthe Nazarenes” (prōtostatēn . . . tēs tōn nazōraiōn haireseōs; Peshitta: rēshā . . . d- yūlpānā\nd- nāṣrāyē). “Nazarenes” is h ere employed as an outsider’s name for the Christian commu-\nnity, namely, for the followers of the man from Nazareth; the label’s potentially pejorative\nresonance is expressly noted by Jerome (de Blois 2002, 2, n. 6; Griffith 2011, 303). Both\nusages—to wit, of the singular as an epithet for Jesus, and derived from this, of the plu-\nral as an appellation for Jesus’s followers— have counter parts in the Babylonian Talmud:\nJesus is given the attribute ha- noṣri, “the Nazarene” or “of Nazareth” (e.g., b.

Tertullian, too, confirms that “Nazarenes” was the general\nJewish designation for Christians (de Blois 2002, 2–3). In Syriac, naṣrāyē—u nlike the much\nmore common Christian self- designations mshīḥāyē and krīsṭyānē (corresponding to Greek\nchristianoi, whose emergence as a collective appellation for Jesus’s disciples is already\nnoted in Acts 11:26)— can occur in speech reported from non- Christians, possibly u nder the\ninfluence of Acts 24:5 (de Blois 2002, 8–10; Griffith 2011, 303–304; see also KU 145–146).\nA dif ere nt and more restricted use of the collective “Nazoraeans” is found in the Chris-\ntian heresiographers Epiphanius and Jerome, who employ the term as a label for groups\nof Christians deemed heretical on account of their continued adherence to the Jewish law\n(de Blois 2002, 2–4; see also the testimonies assembled in Klijn and Reinink 1973). Modern\nscholars often call such groups “Jewish Christians.” Although the Nazoraeans in par tic ul ar\nmay well be a construct (Luomanen 2005), it has been suggested that the Qur’anic naṣārā\nshould be understood in light of this heresiographical usage and may accordingly be Jewish\nChristians (thus de Blois 2002, 1–16) rather than Nicene Christians (thus Griffith 2011). One\nway of highlighting this possibility, which the pre sent work does not adopt, would be to\ntranslate Qur’anic naṣārā as “Nazarenes” rather than as “Christians” throughout (Gnilka\n2007). It bears noting that the question of the reference of the Qur’anic term naṣārā is not\nidentical with the broader prob lem, debated in a host of scholarly publications, whether\nJewish Christ ian ity may have persisted u ntil the emergence of the Qur’an and may have\ninfluenced Qur’anic theology (a claim argued, for instance, in QP 225–314, with ample\nreferences to prior scholarship).4 It would be quite pos si ble to maintain both (i) that the\nterm naṣārā does indeed designate Christians in general, rather than specifically Jewish\nChristians, and (ii) that the Christians encountered by the Qur’an included—y et were not\nconfined to— Jewish Christians, whose beliefs might accordingly have had some influence\non Qur’anic doctrines.\nThe naṣārā in ancient Arabic poetry. The question of the denotation and connotations\nof the word naṣārā is at least to some degree illuminated by its occurrences in pre-I slamic\npoetry (KU 144; see also KU 57 with another verse that is discussed u nder → ḥanīf), even\nthough the prooftexts hitherto identified are relatively few and can be ambiguous or of\nuncertain authenticity. For instance, al- Aʿshā Maymūn lauds a patron by saying that\n“petitioners circumambulate his doors as the naṣārā circumambulate a church with icons\n(ka-ṭ awfi l- naṣārā bi- bayti l- wathan).” The word wathan (see u nder → dhabaḥa) can hardly\ncarry its ordinary meaning “idol” here,5 and is prob ably employed in an extended sense to\nrefer to any figurative repre sent a tions or statue that plays a role in religious ritual, including\n3 The way in which de Blois proposes to understand b. Taʿan. 27b (where fasting on Sundays is discouraged\n“ because of the noṣrim”) is not compelling. According to de Blois, the statement suggests that noṣrim here “does\nnot simply mean ‘Christians,’ but refers to some par tic u lar sect who, unlike the main stream of Christians, re-\ngarded Sunday not as a feast day, but as a day of fasting” (de Blois 2002, 3). However, it is just as pos si ble that the\npoint of the utterance is the need to avoid any unusual displays of piety on Sundays that could be misconstrued\nas attributing undue sacrality to the Christian day of worship.\n4 One obstacle to this conjecture, readily acknowledged by de Blois and Crone, is the lack of direct evidence\nfor Jewish Christians in pre- Islamic Arabia, contrasting with much better evidence for the presence in Arabia of\nvari ous forms of Nicene Chris tian ity. But see QP 226–228 and 277–281.\n5 See Lyall 1918–1924, 1:882, where the use of the term is curtly dismissed as a “ mistake” (ghalaṭ).\n668 al- naṣārā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The main reason for the poet’s\nchoice of the term wathan may be metre and rhyme. Similarly, al-A ʿshā presumably applies\nthe word bayt (“house”) to what would conventionally be called a church or a chapel. An-\nother occurrence of the word naṣārā is found in a poem from the Mufaḍḍaliyyāt, credited\nto Jābir ibn Ḥunayy and reporting how an enemy tribe mocks the poem’s kin, the Chris-\ntian Taghlib, by claiming that their lances are “the lances of Christians (rimāḥu naṣārā),”\nwhich “do not penetrate to the blood” (Lyall 1918–1924, no. 42:21, also cited in Cheikho\n1912–1923, 225; see also Lichtenstadter 1940, 192, pointing out the textual variant rimāḥu\nyahūdin).6 There is also a poem ascribed to Ḥātim al- Ṭāʾī, cited in the Kitāb al- aghānī and\nby the geographer Yāqūt, which would seem to employ the verb tanaṣṣara in the sense of\n“to convert to Chris tian ity” (Wüstenfeld 1866–1870, 4:353; cf. Jamāl 1990, no. 68:6; the\nverse is also cited in Cheikho 1912–1923, 225).7\nIt is worth noting that t here are no pre-I slamic attestations of the word masīḥī (ʿAlī\n1968–1973, 6:585–586), which only became a common term for “Christian” at a much\nlater date (Fiey 1993, 970). By contrast, naṣārā, despite the comparative paucity of its\nattestations in poetry, would seem to have been in use prior to the Qur’an. It would not\nbe convincing to posit that the poetic prooftexts just surveyed employ the word naṣārā in\norder to refer specifically and exclusively to Jewish Christians, rather than to the Nicene\nChristians with whom pre- Islamic speakers of Arabic were undoubtedly familiar. After all,\nthe poem credited to Jābir ibn Ḥunayy is not speaking of the lances of some hitherto un-\nidentified Jewish Christian community, but is referring to the lances of the tribe of Taghlib\n(who were Christian but hardly Jewish Christians, given that they were converted by the\nmonophysite Aḥudemmeh; see Trimingham 1979, 173–174). The wide range of the religious\ncommunities listed especially in Q 22:17 points in the same direction: if the Qur’an really\ndid utilise the word naṣārā to designate Jewish Christians in par tic u lar, we would have\nexpected this list to contain an additional term for gentile Chris tian ity.8\nAl- naṣārā as an outside designation? Can we assume that the word naṣārā, even at\nthe time of the Qur’an, retained an “anti- Christian ring” (Griffith 2011, 314), in line with\nActs 24:5? This seems difficult to square with the very positive assessment of the naṣārā\nin Q 5:82–85. But the weaker claim that the term naṣārā had the connotation of being a\nlabel applied by outsiders, just like “the Jews” (→ al- yahūd), is conceivable. The customary\nassumption that al- Aʿshā was a Christian is open to doubt (Jockers 2010), and even the\nJābir ibn Ḥunayy poem, though reportedly composed by a Christian author, deploys the\nword in the context of a scornful utterance attributed to non- Christian foes. Also relevant\nis the fact that the Christian community of al- Ḥīrah seem to have primarily self- identified\nas ʿibād, “servants,” namely, of God or Christ (Toral- Niehof 2010, 326 and 334) rather\nthan as naṣārā.\nSince the term naṣārā is confined to Medinan surahs, it is pos sib le, though not amenable\nto positive proof, that the Medinan Jews employed the word as the Arabic equivalent of\n6 Horovitz (KU 144) also quotes a line credited to ʿAdī ibn Zayd, preserved as a prooftext cited in the Tāj\nal-ʿ Arūs, that refers to “Christian men” (rijāl naṣārā) burnishing a statue with gold at Easter (al- Muʿaybid 1965,\nno. 31). There is nothing improbable about this citation, but its probative force is undoubtedly compromised by\nthe fact that it is not part of an integral poem.\n7 The Kitāb al- aghānī has the variant tanaḍḍara (Abū l- Faraj al- Iṣbahānī 1927–1974, 17:381).\n8 We would, in other words, have expected Q 22:17 to form a parallel to the inscription of Kartīr, as inter-\npreted in de Blois 2002, 5–8, where “Nazarenes” and “Christians” figure side by side.\nal-n aṣārā 669", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

What, then, are the main doctrinal and other features\nemerging from Qur’anic verses mentioning the Christians (see also Griffith 2001)?11 We\nalready saw that they are associated with the injīl, or “Gospel” (Q 5:47), originally given\nto Jesus (Q 3:48, 5:46.110, and 57:27). As argued elsewhere (→ injīl), the Qur’an could be\nemploying the word injīl as a proper name of sorts for the entire Christian Bible rather\nthan just for the New Testament, since there is no unequivocal evidence that the Qur’an\nconsiders the Christians to possess a bipartite scriptural canon made up of the Torah (al-\ntawrāh) together with the injīl. Doctrinally, the Christians are portrayed as maintaining\nthat “Christ (al-m asīḥ) is God’s son” (Q 9:30) or, alternatively, that “God is Christ, the\nson of Mary” (inna llāha huwa l-m asīḥu bnu maryama; Q 5:17.72).12 Q 5:73 explic itly al-\nludes to Christian Trinitarianism, which is polemically assimilated to tritheism, namely,\na belief in three distinct deities: “Guilty of repudiation are those who say that God is one\nof three” (la- qad kafara alladhīna qālū inna llāha thālithu thalāthatin).13 Trinitarianism is\nalso reflected in Q 4:171, where the “scripture- owners”— who are here ostensibly limited\nto the Christians—a re reminded that Jesus is “only God’s messenger and his word, which\n9 Other Qur’anic terms, too, are likely to have originated in the language of the Medinan Jews, such\nas → ummī (“scriptureless”) or → al- sakīnah (“composure, tranquillity”).

Verse 82 itself is particularly replete with them, containing not\nonly alladhīna qālū innā naṣārā but also alladhīna āmanū and alladhīna ashrakū.\n11 For a detailed analy sis of how this material is treated by Islamic exegetes, see McAulife 1991.\n12 Neither Q 5:17 nor 5:72 contains the word naṣārā (although they do figure in v. 14), but it is overwhelmingly\nlikely that they are being referred to, given their express mention in Q 9:30.\n13 For a dif ere nt reading of Q 5:73, see Griffith 2007, 100*–108*, taking thālithu thalāthatin to be a calque on\nthe Syriac epithet tlītāyā, “the treble one,” applied to Jesus Christ due to his being characterised in vario us ways\nby the number three (e.g., by virtue of having spent three days in the grave). Given the phrase thāniya thnayni\n(“as one of two”) in Q 9:40, it is undeniable that thālithu thalāthatin has the numerical sense “one of three.” This\nis admitted by Griffith himself, although he proposes that the phrase could still sim ult an eously echoes the epithet\ntlītāyā (Griffith 2011, 317).

Incidentally, although the accuracy of extant heresiographical accounts of the\nbeliefs allegedly held by vario us groups of Jewish Christians is uncertain, it is doubtful that\nJewish Christians would have been content to identify the “son of Mary” as God’s ofspring\nand as belonging to a divine trinity. This militates against identifying the Qur’anic naṣārā\nwith Jewish- Christian Nazarenes (Griffith 2011, 314–315). Despite the considerable amount\nof speculation involved in reconstructing Jewish- Christian Christologies, therefore, the\nQur’an’s admittedly fragmentary information about the Christology of the naṣārā is com-\npatible with mainstream Nicene Chris tian ity.15\nAlthough the Christology attributed to the Qur’anic naṣārā mostly approximates main-\nstream Christian doctrines, at least as t hese may have been perceived by outsiders, t here is\none re spect in which one detects a radical discrepancy between the two. Q 5:116 famously\nseems to identify the third member of the Christian Trinity besides God and Jesus with\nMary rather than the Holy Spirit: “And when God said, ‘O Jesus, son of Mary, did you say\nto the people, “Take me and my m other as two gods besides God” (a- anta qulta li- l- nāsi\nttakhidhūnī wa- ummī ilāhayni min dūni llāhi)?’ He said, ‘Glory be to you! It does not be-\nhove me to say something to which I have no right.’ ”16 Yet instead of taking this passage at\nface value and of attempting to locate a Christian group who might have been understood\nor misunderstood to be operating with a trinity composed of God, Jesus, and Mary (thus\nde Blois 2002, 13–15, and also QP 262–276),17 it has more convincingly been suggested\nthat Q 5:116 involves a polemically motivated degree of distortion or caricature (Griffith\n2011, 318; Reynolds 2014, 52–54), by casting the evident fact that Christians pray to Mary\nas manifesting their propensity towards illicit deification.18 In fact, the Qur’an pre sents\nChristian belief in the divinity of Jesus as instantiating a general pattern that is exhibited\n14 For a justification of the decision to render rūḥun minhu as “his spirit” rather than “a spirit of/from him,”\nsee n. 9 under → rūḥ.\n15 De Blois draws attention to the Elchasaites, whom the heresiographer Hippolytus portrays as believing\nin a “son of God,” forming a trinity of sorts together with God and a female “Holy Spirit” (de Blois 2002, 14–15;\nsee also Klijn and Reinink 1973, 114–115). However, as de Blois himself is aware, the Elchasaite “Holy Spirit,”\nfemale though she may be, is not identical with Jesus’s earthly mother Mary (see also the further discussion of\nthe Spirit being described as Jesus’s heavenly “ mother” in QP 267–271). A succinct overview of the vari ous ways\nin which Jewish Christians conceived of Christ is provided in QP 246–259. Against the naive assumption that\nJewish Christians considered Jesus to be a mere h uman, Crone calls attention to the importance of “host Chris-\ntology,” according to which a pre- existent heavenly and perhaps even divine being came to take up residence\nin the human Jesus on the occasion of his baptism, thereby potentially elevating him to superhuman or divine\nstatus. Specifically on the Christology of the so- called Ebionites, refer to Häkkinen 2005, 265–272.\n16 On the meaning of min dūni llāhi here, see Ambros 2001, 11. The expression is also briefly discussed\nunder → ashraka.\n17 See in par tic u lar QP 271–273, cata loguing evidence that there were indeed Christians who believed Mary\nor her body to be “from heaven.”\n18 According to Q 5:75, Jesus and Mary were mere humans who “ate food” (see QP 263). This, too, could\nbe taken to be aimed at opponents who divinised Mary. But alternatively, Q 5:75 may simply be articulating\nthe charge that Christians incongruously pray to and venerate a woman who was a mere mortal. Thus con-\nstrued, there is not necessarily an implication of doctrinally explicit deification here, only one of unseemly\ncultic practices. It is true that the insistence that Jesus and Mary “ate food” in Q 5:75 comes in the wake of a\nrejection of Trinitarianism in v. 73 (“Guilty of repudiation are those who say that God is one of three”). This\ndoes engender the impression that Q 5:75, like 5:116, is envisaging a Christian Trinity composed of God, Jesus,\nand Mary (QP 265–266).

As Q 9:30 summarily puts it, Jews and Christians “imitate\nwhat was said by earlier repudiators” (yuḍāhiʾūna qawla lladhīna kafarū min qablu). On\nthis reading, the Qur’anic text does not supply evidence that Christians in its environment\nactually considered Mary to be divine; rather, the Qur’an is driving home the message\nthat the seeming intricacy of Christian dogma is merely another variant on the perennial\nhuman susceptibility to blur and distort rigorous mono the ism.\nThe Qur’an considers the Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus to deviate from the\nlatter’s explicit teaching: Jesus ster eo typically commands his audience to “serve God, my\nLord and yourp Lord” (Q 5:72.117; see also 3:51, 19:36, and 43:64),19 with Q 5:72 adding a\nwarning that associationism, shirk (verb: → ashraka), w ill lead to eschatological perdition.\nThe theme of Christian unfaithfulness to Jesus is also echoed in Q 19:37 and 43:65 (on which\nsee HCI 177 and 186, n. 87), where an appeal by Jesus to serve God alone is followed by the\ndeclaration that subsequently “the factions (singular: → ḥizb) disagreed among themselves”\n(fa- khtalafa l- aḥzābu min baynihim), just as t here had previously been disagreement (verb:\nikhtalafa) about the Mosaic scripture (e.g., Q 11:110, 41:45: “We gave Moses the scripture\nand there was disagreement about it,” wa- la- qad ātaynā mūsā l- kitāba fa-k htulifa fīhi).20 To\nbe sure, neither Q 19:37 nor 43:65 involves explicit mention of the naṣārā; but the reason\nfor this may simply be that the term naṣārā is confined to the Medinan period while Q 19\nand 43 are Meccan. In any case, the diagnosis of factionalism is best read as the Qur’an’s\nperception of late antique doctrinal strife between vario us Christian churches.\nLike the Israelites or the Jews, the Qur’an accuses the Christians of failing to adhere\nto the covenant (mīthāq) that God has imposed on them, even though the charge is cast\nin more mea sured language with regard to the Christians than the Jews (cf. Q 5:14 with\n5:12–13 and 4:155–161, on all of which see in more detail u nder → wāthaqa). Also like the\nJews, the Qur’an portrays the Christians as supremely confident of being in the exclusive\npossession of religious truth and, consequently, as demanding conversion: “The Jews and\nthe Christians will not be satisfied with you [namely, the Qur’anic Messenger] u ntil you\nfollow their religious teaching (→ millah),” says Q 2:120, while 5:18 alleges that the Jews\nand the Christians claim that “we are God’s sons and his beloved ones” (see in more detail\nunder → allāh). The Jews and the Christian dismiss one another as having “no ground to\nstand on,” according to Q 2:113. Hence, when Q 2:111 reports that “they say, ‘Only Jews\nand Christians will enter the garden,’ ” or when 2:135 states that “they say, ‘Be Jews or\nChristians so that you may be guided,’ ” this should be understood to mean that the Jews\n19 Q 19:36 is not expressly framed as said by Jesus, even though the latter is mentioned in v. 34. But it is\nnonetheless likely that the entire couplet consisting of Q 19:35–36 should be construed as an utterance by Jesus,\ngiven that 43:64, which is virtually identical with 19:36, does occur in the wake of the direct speech marker qāla.\nThe only verses in which the phrase “God, my Lord and your Lord” is not associated with Jesus are Q 11:56, 40:27,\nand 44:20; but unlike the utterances attributed to Jesus, the phrase does not function as the object of ʿabada, “to\nserve,” here. This exclusive association of the composite expression “to serve” + “God, my Lord and your Lord”\nwith Jesus is justifiably viewed as distancing Jesus from Christian deification of him, a point made much more\novertly in Q 5:116–117. For another case in which a Qur’anic verse is to be understood as direct speech despite\nthe absence of an introductory speech marker, as would seem to be the case in Q 19:35–36, see 89:27–30 (spoken\nby God at the final judgement).\n20 For more on ikhtalafa and related verbs, see under → ummah, → bayyana, and → ḥizb.\n672 al- naṣārā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Thus, Q 5:82, which lauds the Christians for being more amicably\ndisposed to the Qur’anic believers than the Jews and the associators, notes that there are\nqissīsūn and ruhbān among the Christians. The former word is clearly derived from Syr-\niac qashshīshā, meaning not only “elder, presbyter” but also “priest” in general (KU 64;\nFVQ 239–240; Zellentin 2016, 273–274; cf. Ethiopic qasis). The word was also loaned into\nSabaic, as demonstrated by an inscription from 548 CE by the Christian Ḥimyarite king\nAbraha, which commemorates the restoration of the dam of Mārib (Sima 2004, 27–28;\nCIH, no. 541, l. 67). Ruhbān, meanwhile, literally means “fearers,”24 presumably of God.\nThe word also occurs in Q 9:31.34, where the “God- fearers” (ruhbān) are paired with the\nJewish aḥbār, namely, rabbinic scholars (KU 63; FVQ 49–50; Zellentin 2016, 267–271):\nthe Jews and Christians have adopted their aḥbār and their ruhbān as “lords besides God”\n(arbāban min dūni llāhi), the text charges (Q 9:31), and both groups are condemned for\n“unjustly consuming people’s possessions” and for “barring [ people] from God’s path”\n(Q 9:34; cf. 4:161). Fin ally, Q 57:27 uses the abstract noun rahbāniyyah, which one might\nliterally render as “God-f earingness.” According to one plausible syntactic construal, the\nverse declares that God placed (jaʿalnā) in the hearts of Jesus’s followers (alladhīna tta-\nbaʿūhu) tenderness (raʾfah), mercy (→ raḥmah), and rahbāniyyah. The latter then becomes\na topic of further comment: “they originated it (ibtadaʿūhā); we did not prescribe it for\nthem (mā katabnāhā ʿalayhim)— rather, [the only thing we prescribed for them was /\nthey only introduced rahbāniyyah as a manner of] desiring God’s satisfaction (illā btighāʾa\n21 See also Q 3:113–114, 5:66, and 7:159, recognising that the scripture- owners or “the p eople of Moses” (i.e.,\nthe Israelites) include a community that “stands upright,” is at least “moderate” or “middling,” or is endowed\nwith right guidance. See also Q 3:199, acknowledging that some of the scripture- owners “believe in God and\nwhat was sent down to youp and what was sent down to them,” as well as 2:253, 3:110, and 35:32.\n22 On how Q 2:62 and 5:69 might be reconciled with verses like 3:85 (“Whoever desires a religion other than\nal- islām, it w ill not be accepted from him, and he w ill be one of the losers in the hereafter”), see u nder → aslama.\n23 An equivalent question may be posed with regard to Q 3:64, inviting the scripture- owners “to a word\ncommon between us and you,” consisting in serving only God, associating nothing else with him, and not taking\neach other “as lords besides God.” It seems at best uncertain that conventional Christian belief in the divinity of\nJesus would qualify as passing this test.\n24 That rahiba, yarhabu means “to fear” in Qur’anic Arabic is well supported (see CDKA 117). Thus, in\nQ 2:40, 7:154, and 16:51, the verb is efectively a synonym of → ittaqā.\nal-n aṣārā 673", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This fits the word’s occurrence in pre-I slamic poetry, which depicts\nthe figure of the rāhib or “God-f earer” as engrossed in devotion and supplications to God\n(DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 48:37 = EAP 2:69–70; DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 65:2), evokes\nthe light emanating from his solitary dwelling (DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 48:37.66 = EAP\n2:69–70 and 82–83; DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 52:20), and associates him with writings\n(DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 65:2) and with celibacy (DSAAP, al-N ābighah, no. 7:26).26\nNonetheless, Holger Zellentin, building on Emran El- Badawi, has persuasively argued that\nthe Qur’anic ruhbān should not be equated with monks but rather o ught to be identified\nwith bishops, even if some of the latter may well have been monks and celibate (El-B adawi\n2013; Zellentin 2016, 271–284). For one, the way in which Q 9:31.34 parallelises the ruhbān\nwith the aḥbār suggests that the former are understood to be the Christian equivalent of the\nlatter, which would make the ruhbān communal leaders rather than monks or hermits per se\n(even though Christian “holy men” did of course perform communal leadership functions\ntoo). Moreover, Q 57:27 would seem to presuppose that t here is a proper and Qur’anically\nacceptable manner of practising rahbāniyyah or “God-f earingness”; and the fact that God\nis explic itly said to have placed rahbāniyyah in the hearts of Jesus’s followers (at least if\nrahbāniyyah is, with Beck 1946, 18–20, construed as a third object of jaʿalnā in Q 57:27)\nalso suggests that the Qur’an views rahbāniyyah with a degree of sympathy, like the two\npreceding objects, tenderness (raʾfah) and mercy (raḥmah). Such a positive view would be\ndifficult to make sense of if celibacy were a dominant component of rahbāniyyah, since by\nthe Medinan period the Qur’anic proclamations had certainly come to endorse marriage as\na normal and unproblematic aspect of h uman existence.27 In addition, the contention that\nthe Christians have taken their ruhbān as “lords besides God” also maps rather well onto the\nChristian view that the bishop deserves to be honoured like God b ecause he “sits for you\n25 For a discussion of the syntax of the verse, see Beck 1946, 17–24, who convincingly treats rahbāniyyah\nas a third object of jaʿalnā. Illā is often read as an istithnāʾ munqaṭiʿ or “discontinuous exception” h ere (on the\ngrammatical concept, see Wright 1974, 2:335–337; see also the discussion of Q 18:50 under → shayṭān). Thus, for\ninstance, Zam. 6:53, with the gloss wa- lakinnahum ibtadaʿūhā btighāʾa riḍwāni llāhi. Alternatively, the verse may\nbe read as saying, “They in ven ted it of their own accord; we only prescribed it for them as a manner of desiring\nGod’s satisfaction“ (thus Sinai 2018a, 28), which would imply at least a conditional divine mandate for rahbāni-\nyyah. Given that the exegetical tradition equates rahbāniyyah with monasticism and celibacy, it is unsurprising\nthat this latter construal is not popul ar among Muslim commentators, but see Fakhr al-D īn al- Rāzī 1981, 29:247,\nwho explic itly notes the viability of construing the verse as an istithnāʾ muttaṣil. Beck prefers an istithnāʾ munqaṭiʿ.\nBut in favour of an istithnāʾ muttaṣil, implying that God did prescribe rahbāniyyah at least in an attenuated or\nconditional sense, as a way of striving for divine favour, one can appeal to the likely status of rahbāniyyah as one\nof the three virtues that God is said to have placed in the hearts of Jesus’s followers. This suggests that rahbāniyyah\nis not a completely arbitrary human invention.\n26 See also the overview of poetic reflections of monks and monastic life in Schmid, forthcoming b, ch. 1,\nnoting synonyms of rāhib.\n27 But see Sinai 2017a, 231–232, for a pos si ble echo of an early Qur’anic praise of carnal abstinence. Two\nfurther considerations adduced by Zellentin are the following: (i) There is sufficient evidence for an association\nof bishops with fear of God to permit one to understand why the Qur’an might call them, or at least include them\nunder the rubric of, “God-f earers,” ruhbān. (ii) The juxtaposition of ruhbān and qissīsūn in Q 5:82 can be viewed\nas paralleling the bipartite structure of ecclesiastical leadership described in the Didascalia Apostolorum, where\nthe bishop functions as the head of a council of “elders” (qashshīshē). The qissīsūn, therefore, may not be priests\nin general but rather subordinate clergy operating under episcopal oversight.\n674 al- naṣārā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Fin ally, t here is indirect evidence that\nthe institution of the episcopate was known in the Qur’anic milieu, since the pre sent a tion\nof Muhammad’s authority and function in the Medinan surahs appropriates aspects of the\nway in which Christian texts construct the figure of the bishop (Sinai 2018a).\nSeeing that by the time of the Qur’an bishops w ere increasingly drawn from the ranks of\nmonks (Zellentin 2016, 276 and 277), leading to the “appropriation of monastic charisma by\nthe institutional church” (Rapp 2005, 137), it cannot be taken for granted anyway that the\nhearers of the Qur’an would have made a clear- cut distinction between both groups. Rather,\nQur’anic references to the ruhbān and rahbāniyyah may be rooted in the perception that it is\na characteristic feature of Christ iani ty to expect its communal leaders (what ever their pre-\ncise institutional status) to be endowed with manifest fearfulness of God— notwithstanding\nthe fact that Christians did not, according to Q 57:27, fully and properly live up to this ideal of\nrahbāniyyah, or “God- fearingness,” an assessment also implied by the accusations profered\nin Q 9:31.34. A similar perception of Christ iani ty as being marked by ostentatious fear of\nGod manifests itself in the fact that Christians in the Sasanian empire w ere called “fearers”\n(tarsāgān) in Pahlavi (Pines 1968).28 Moreover, in Christian lit er a ture from the second\ncentury onwards, Christians are described as the “God-f earers” par excellence, a descriptor\nthat “carried an implicit or explicit denial that anyone e lse, particularly the Jews, could also\nclaim the epithet” (Lieu 1995, 501). Of course, the Qur’anic proclamations themselves accord\na prominent position to the virtue of God-w ariness (taqwā; → ittaqā). It may nonetheless\nbe deliberate that in referring to Christian “God- fearers” (ruhbān) or “God- fearingness”\n(rahbāniyyah), the Qur’an employs words that are derived from a dif ere nt consonantal\nroot than its own dominant terminology for fearing God: rahbāniyyah is not simply taqwā\nbut something dif ere nt, more ambiguous, and more distinctly Christian, and perhaps also\nsomething more institutionally concrete.\nJesus causing an Israelite schism (Q 61:14): the Qur’anic account of Christian ori-\ngins? Despite the Qur’an’s evident awareness of animosity between the Jews and the Chris-\ntians, the Islamic scripture depicts Jesus as a “messenger” (→ rasūl) sent to the Israelites\nrather than to humanity at large (Q 3:49, 61:6; see Bijlefeld 1969, 26, n. 107; Goudarzi 2018,\n331–335; Goudarzi 2019, 427). According to Q 61:14, Jesus’s preaching caused the p eople\nof Israel to break apart into two “factions” (singular: ṭāʾifah; see CDKA 176), a believing\ngroup (who included Jesus’s disciples, the ḥawāriyyūn) and an unbelieving or “repudiat-\ning” group, who eventually sufered some sort of defeat.29 It may appear as if the Qur’an\n28 Nöldeke and P. J. de Menasce posit that the word tarsāg was initially applied to God-f earing ascetics and\nthen secondarily extended to all Christians (Nöldeke 1900, 163), whose “representative par excellence” the ascetic\nwas (Pines 1968, 144, summarising de Menasce). Pines himself accepts that t here is a link between Arabic rāhib\nand Pahlavi tarsāg, but maintains, against Nöldeke and de Menasce, that “it is conceivable that, in translating\nthe Pahlavi term which denoted Christians in general, the Arabs restricted its meaning and applied it only to\nmonks.” However, Zellentin’s work should make us cautious to accept it as axiomatic that rāhib means “monk”\ntout court, understood to be conceptually opposed to the laity. That is, non- Christian Arabs may feasibly have\nviewed Christian anchorites and ascetics as “God- fearers” par excellence, who embodied to a particularly pal-\npable degree the general and ostentatious preoccupation with fearing God— Qur’anically speaking, the habitus\nof rahbāniyyah— that was felt to characterise Chris tian ity as such, without therefore assuming the clear- cut\ndichotomy between monks and laypersons that seems self- evident from within Chris tian ity.\n29 For use of the word ṭāʾifah with regard to Jews and Christians, see also Q 6:156, which maintains that\nprior to the Qur’anic revelations the celestial scripture had only been sent down upon “two factions” (innamā\nunzila l- kitābu ʿalā ṭāʾifatayni min qablinā). The two factions in question must be the Jews and the Christians.\nBut it would obviously be unwarranted to make the automatic assumption that the term ṭāʾifah always means\nJews or Christians; it clearly doesn’t at Q 7:87.\nal-n aṣārā 675", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This\nwould form an arresting contrast with the standard view that mainstream Christ ian ity is a\nmovement that mostly drew its converts from outside the people of Israel. Such apparent\ndownplaying of gentile Christ iani ty and the impression that by casting Jesus as a messenger\nto the Israelites the Qur’an is casting Chris tian ity as an inner- Israelite phenomenon has\nbeen marshalled in favour of the claim that the Qur’anic understanding of Jesus betrays\nan influence of Jewish Chris tian ity (QP 232–236).\nBut the inference is questionable, given that the Qur’anic portrayal of Jesus as a mes-\nsenger sent to the Israelites and followed by Israelites (albeit not by all of them) is expli-\ncable within the framework of the Qur’an’s general prophetological assumptions (thus\nalso Goudarzi 2018, 334–335), according to which a human messenger of God is normally\ndispatched to a specific people, in most cases his own people (Q 10:74 and 30:47) or at\nleast a people whose language the messenger commands (Q 14:4).30 Moreover, the fact\nthat according to Q 61:14 the preaching of Jesus caused the people of Israel to disintegrate\ninto a believing and an unbelieving ṭāʾifah has a perfect counterpart in the impact of the\nmessenger Shuʿayb sent to Madyan (Q 7:87), who likewise brought about a split of his\npeople into a believing faction and an unbelieving one (Goudarzi 2019, 434). Q 61:14\ntherefore narrates the ministry of Jesus in precisely the way in which one would expect it\nto be imagined based on the Qur’an’s general prophetology.\nBy way of casting further doubt on a Jewish- Christian reading of Q 61:14, one might\nfeel like adding that the verse simply accords with the basic historical fact that Jesus’s\noriginal preaching was addressed to his fellow Israelites (e.g., Matt 15:24) and that Chris-\ntian ity did in fact originate from within Judaism, what ever the l ater importance of gentile\nconversion. However, the Qur’an is actually not very explicit about the link that obtains\nbetween Jesus’s original disciples (al- ḥawāriyyūn) and his believing followers, who are\nmentioned in Q 61:14, and the present- day group called al- naṣārā, who do not figure in\n61:14; it is not self- evident that from the Qur’anic vantage point the latter are straightfor-\nwardly identifiable as latter- day members of one and the same religious community as the\nformer. It is, admittedly, alluring to view Q 61:14’s reference to a victory of the believing\nIsraelites who rallied around Jesus over their opponents as an allusion to the ascendancy\nof Chris tian ity over Judaism; but the verse could simply refer to some sort of immediate\ndivine intervention rescuing the believing Israelites from their enemies, a motif familiar\nfrom other prophetic narratives in the Qur’an. In sum, it is not certain that Q 61:14 is\nthe Qur’an’s account of Christian origins, in the sense of explaining how the present- day\ncommunity identified as al- naṣārā first came into being.\nThe upshot, in any case, is that while the Qur’an undeniably understands the initial fol-\nlowers of Jesus to have been Israelites, it is far from certain how far this explic itly Israelite\ncategorisation may be assumed to extend beyond the time of Jesus. The Qur’an may well\nbe taking for granted that the ranks of the original followers of Jesus were subsequently\n30 The objection is acknowledged, but not in my view resolved, in QP 233–234. A similar argument may be\nhad regarding the fact that the Qur’an depicts Jesus as having “confirmed” the Torah (Q 3:50, 5:46, and 61:6).\nEven though he is also said to have abolished some of its prohibitions (Q 3:50), this idea “would have been alien\nto gentile Christians,” Crone says (QP 245). But rather than telling us something about the views of Jesus current\nin the Qur’anic milieu, this understanding of Jesus may simply reflect the Qur’an’s general prophetology, accord-\ning to which later messengers or prophets confirm earlier ones (Q 3:81–82), and specifically the claim that the\nQur’anic revelations “confirm” earlier ones and therefore deserve to be recognised in turn by the cont emporary\nIsraelites or scripturalists (e.g., Q 2:41.91.97, 3:3, 4:47, 5:48).\n676 al- naṣārā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, Q 61:14 does\nnot entail that it is warranted to take the collective term “the Israelites” (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl),\nwhen applied to contemporaries of the Qur’anic Messenger (as, e.g., in Q 2:40.47.122), to\nencompass not only Jews but also Christians (against QP 237–244). There is, accordingly,\nat least a question mark over the conjecture that the Qur’an reflects interaction with a\ntype of Christians for whom a claim to genealogical descent from the p eople of Israel\nwas an integral part of their self- definition. Hence, although the textual evidence is not\nentirely without ambiguity,31 it does appear that the only overarching Qur’anic rubric that\nexplic itly groups together both con temporary Jews and con temporary Christians is the\nconcept of the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb), a category that seems to be original\nto the Qur’an. What present- day Jews and Christians are envisaged as sharing, then, is not\nethnic descent but rather their possession of and commitment to a textual deposit of prior\ndivine revelations, even if this textual deposit is the legacy of God’s revelatory engagement\nwith the ancient Israelites in par tic u lar.\nThe Qur’an’s understanding of Jesus as an Israelite messenger has the impor tant upshot\nthat from the Qur’anic vantage point the moment at which God’s full revelatory engage-\nment with humans expands beyond the p eople of Israel is not the ministry of Jesus but\nrather that of Muhammad. To be sure, the Qur’an does speak of earlier envoys sent by God\nto what are presumably non-I sraelite p eoples, such as Ṣālih to Thamūd (e.g., Q 26:141–159),\nbut unlike Muhammad these earlier non- Israelite messengers did not apparently relay\nproperly scriptural revelations. By contrast, the Medinan surahs unequivocally cast Mu-\nhammad as God’s prophet to the scriptureless (al- ummiyyūn; → ummī), i.e., to that part\nof humanity who fall outside the two “factions” (cf. Q 6:156) making up the “scripture-\nowners.” Muhammad is the divinely appointed “messenger from among” the hitherto\nscriptureless, who w ill “purify them and teach them the scripture and wisdom, even if they\nwere previously in manifest error” (Q 62:2; cf. 7:157–158). In fact, some Medinan verses\n(Q 3:20, 5:15.19) suggest that Muhammad’s divinely intended constituency is not limited\nto those not yet endowed with scriptural revelations but includes the “scripture- owners”\n31 Some of the evidence that Crone adduces in favour of the contrary position relies on the post- Qur’anic\nIslamic tradition, which is hardly conclusive in the matter at hand. Thus, if one discounts later exegesis, Q 27:76\n(“This qurʾān recounts to the Israelites most of that about which they disagree”) does not unequivocally\nestablish that the Israelites con temporary with Muhammad encompassed Christians. Instead, Q 27:76 could\nsimply allude to inner- Jewish disputes rather than to arguments between Jews and Christians. Note that\nthe Qur’an clearly considers religious disagreement or ikhtilāf to be a universal human phenomenon (e.g.,\nQ 10:19, 16:92) and implies that inner- Israelite disagreement arose already in the wake of Moses (Q 11:110,\n41:45, 45:16–17). Nor is the hypothesis that the Qur’an considers con temporary Christians to be Israelites\nsupported by Q 5:72. The verse denounces those who say, “God is Christ (al-m asīḥ), the son of Mary,” and\nthen proceeds to remind the audience that Jesus himself commanded the Israelites to “serve God, my Lord\nand your Lord.” Crone asks, “Why does the Messenger envisage Jesus as saying this to the Israelites rather\nthan the Christians?” (QP 238–239; cf. also Goudarzi 2019, 427). But quite obviously, the Qur’an here simply\nre spects the historical fact that the full consolidation of a Christian community postdates the ministry of Jesus.\nThus, Q 5:72 condemns Christian belief in the divinity of Jesus by adducing what is, according to the Qur’an,\nthe basic message expounded by Jesus in his historical (namely, Israelite) context. Nothing about the passage\naccordingly necessitates the inference that the Israelites addressed by Jesus include Christians. Moreover, the\nfact that some Qur’anic passages mention the Jews and Christians in tandem, as in Q 5:18 (QP 240), simply\nmanifests a Qur’anic tendency to undermine the “scripture- owners” by portraying their two branches as given\nto analogous errors (see HCI 201). See also Goudarzi 2019, 427, who argues that the Israelite identity of con-\ntemporary Christians may be inferred from Q 2:120–122 (which I also do not find compelling).\nal-n aṣārā 677", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

For instance, at Q 2:47.122, a fter exhorting the Israelites to remember\nGod’s grace, the divine voice tells them that “I have preferred you over the world- dwellers”\n(annī faḍḍaltukum ʿalā l-ʿ ālamīn).2 Niʿmah, by contrast, would seem to signify primarily\nthe voluntary and generous conferral of something that is desirable and apt to help the\nbeneficiary flourish. Both niʿmah and faḍl may to some degree be considered Qur’anic\ncounter parts to the Hebrew Bible’s use of the Hebrew root ḥ- n- n and to Greek charis in the\nNew Testament (e.g., TDOT 5:22–36, NIDOTTE 2:203–206, TDNT 9:359–415), though\nthe theological concepts these words express— e.g., when Paul speaks of justification by\ngrace, as in Rom 3:24— must not therefore be conflated with Qur’anic ideas. Incidentally,\nthe word niʿmah figures in the poem on the creation of the world that is attributed to the\nChristian ʿAdī ibn Zayd (al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 103:2; see Dmitriev 2010, 353–355), which\npurports to retell “how the God of creation caused his grace to become vis i ble to us (abdā\nilāhu l- khalqi niʿmatahu fīnā) and made his primordial signs known to us (wa-ʿ arrafanā\nāyātihi l-uwalā).”\nA third Qur’anic term whose meaning and behaviour shows some overlap with niʿmah\nand faḍl is → āyah, “sign,” as illustrated by the co- occurrence of niʿmah and āyah in Q 2:211\nand 31:31 (and also in the verse of poetry just cited). For example, Q 31:31 categorises the\nfact that God has endowed h umans with the ability to traverse the sea by means of ships\nboth as an act of grace (niʿmah) and as playing the role of a sign (āyah). What is distinc-\ntive of the term āyah, in contrast to niʿmah and faḍl, is the idea that a given phenomenon\nconveys, or ought to convey, certain doctrinal truths about God, such as his power and\nhis claim to gratitude.\nThe panoply of divine grace. Benefactions can be conferred from one human upon\nanother (Q 26:22, 33:37), but in real ity all benefactions and acts of grace come from God\n(Q 16:53: wa- mā bikum min niʿmatin fa- mina llāhi). In fact, God’s benevolence surpasses\nprecise quantification: “if youp try to number the grace of God, you will never arrive at cal-\nculating its sum total” (Q 14:34, 16:18: wa-in taʿuddū niʿmata llāhi lā tuḥṣūhā). Accordingly,\nthe range of phenomena that the Qur’an subsumes under the category of divine grace is\nconsiderable. Q 35:3 appeals to the addressees to remember God’s grace and then reminds\nthem that he is the creator who sustains and provisions humans “from the heaven and the\nearth” (cf. also Q 16:114). According to Q 16:72.81, God’s grace includes the fact that he\nhas endowed h umans with spousal relations and progeny, that he has provided them with\n“good things” (wa-r azaqakum mina l-ṭ ayyibāti; → razaqa), that he has created shade and\nplaces of refuge for them, and that he has given them clothing that protects from heat\nand functions as armour. Q 31:31, as we saw, mentions ships, while Q 29:67 refers to God’s\ngrace immediately after highlighting his establishment of the Meccan sanctuary. Q 19:58\nconcludes a cycle of narratives whose protagonists include Mary and Jesus, Abraham,\n2 Cf. also Q 5:20, where Moses reminds the Israelites of the grace that God has bestowed upon them and\nthe fact that he “gave you what he did not give to anyone else among the world- dwellers.” The verse does not,\nhowever, make use of f- ḍ- l.\nanʿama 679", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In accordance with this, the divine voice calls Jesus “a servant upon\nwhom we bestowed grace and whom we made an exemplar (→ mathal) for the Israelites”\n(Q 43:59). The Israelites themselves are also singled out as recipients of God’s grace: for\ninstance, God gave them prophets and made them kings (Q 5:20; see also 2:40.47.122). The\nIsraelites’ deliverance from Pha raoh, too, was an act of divine grace (Q 14:6), as was the\nrescue of Lot and his f amily (Q 54:35). Other individuals or collectives within humanity at\nlarge who are said to have received divine grace are Joseph and his family (Q 12:6), Moses\n(Q 28:17), Jonah (68:49), Muhammad (Q 52:29, 68:2, 93:11), and the Qur’anic believers,\nwhom God has protected in battle and assisted against their enemies (Q 3:174, 5:11, 33:9)\nand whom he has transformed from erstwhile foes into brothers (Q 3:103).\nWhile the preceding reminiscences of divine grace first and foremost allude to this-\nworldly blessings, God’s grace can also be referenced in an eschatological context, though\nthis is less frequent in the Qur’an. At Q 37:57, one of the inhabitants of paradise credits his\nsalvation to “the grace of my Lord,” and at 4:69 the phrase “ those upon whom God has be-\nstowed grace” (alladhīna anʿama llāhu ʿalayhim) seems to serve as a general label for t hose\nwho w ill be rewarded with paradise. According to Q 3:171, those who have been “killed on\nGod’s path” (v. 169: alladhīna qutilū fī sabīl allāh; → sabīl) are already in God’s presence\nand rejoice in his grace and favour (yastabshirūna bi- niʿmatin mina llāhi wa- faḍlin).\nGod’s grace and human gratitude. Passages like Q 3:171 show that God’s bestowal\nof grace can respond to prior human merit: it is clear that God’s grace here is a reward\nfor facing mortal danger in b attle on behalf of one’s religious allegiance. A similar nexus\nfigures in Q 54:35, which pre sents God’s deliverance of Lot both as an act of grace and\nas compensation “for those who are grateful” (ka- dhālika najzī man shakar), namely, for\nthose who are grateful to God.\nYet divine grace is not invariably a reward. Q 39:49 criticises those who self- confidently\ncredit their receipt of some divine benefaction or grace to their own “knowledge”; rather,\nthe verse continues, it is a “trial” (fitnah; see under → balā). Similarly, Q 14:6 describes\nGod’s deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian slavery as both an act of grace (niʿmah)\nand as containing a test (balāʾ; see under → balā). Divine grace, just like divine favour\n(f- ḍ-l ), can thus serve to ascertain, rather than reward, an individual’s moral merit, by\nbringing to light how he or she reacts to the bounty generously granted by God (see also\nunder → darajah). An improper response to divine grace, as Q 39:8 makes clear, would be\nto “forget” (→ nasiya) one’s antecedent imploration to the Lord, to recognise false deities,\nand to display ingratitude (kufr) to God. Other passages also condemn those who ungrate-\nfully repudiate (verb: → kafara) or fail to recognise (verb: → ankara) God’s blessings and\nbenefactions (Q 14:28, 16:72.83, 29:67).3 One passage hints that when God “changes” or\ntakes away a benefaction that he has granted to a certain p eople, this must be due to some\nprior misstep of the recipients (Q 8:53, on which see KK 190; cf. Q 13:11).\nThe appropriate response to divine benefactions, by contrast, is to remember\n(verb: → dhakara) them, as dif ere nt groups of addressees are charged (Q 2:40.47.122.231,\n3:103, 5:7.11.20.110, 14:6, 33:9, 35:3, 43:13), and to be grateful (shakara) for them (see Q 5:7,\n3 See also Q 17:83 and 41:51, where it is “turning away” (aʿraḍa) that is disapproved.\n680 anʿama", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Urge\nme to be grateful for your grace, which you have bestowed upon me and my parents, and\nto do right eous deeds with which you are pleased” (rabbi awziʿnī an ashkura niʿmataka llatī\nanʿamta ʿalayya wa-ʿ alā wālidayya wa-an aʿmala ṣāliḥan tarḍāhu; see also u nder → ṣāliḥ).\nThe prayer shows that the fitting way of showing one’s gratitude for divine benefactions\ninvolves not just speech acts but also moral behaviour.\nnaʿīm | delight, bliss\n→ jannah\nnafakha intr./tr.

(namely, one’s soul)\nOverview of the three senses of Qur’anic nafs. Although some Qur’anic occurrences of\nthe noun nafs can be understood in more than one meaning, one may in general distinguish\nthe following three uses of the word.1\n(i) As discussed in more detail below, nafs can pick out certain aspects of the interior\ndimension of h uman personhood. When used in this capacity, al- nafs is customarily trans-\nlated as “the soul,” although “the lower self” or “the vital self”2 is often more apposite. At\nleast by way of an interpretive stepping- stone, it is not out of place to compare it to the\nPlatonic epithymētikon (Republic 439d), the “appetitive” part of the human soul that ought\nto be ruled by reason with the aid of the soul’s “spirited” part. Somewhat similarly, the\nQur’an and pre- Islamic poetry associate the nafs with a range of appetitive and aversive\nmental phenomena that h uman agents must strive to restrain and keep in check in order\nto assert their commitment to ethical or religious values and princi ples.\n(ii) Secondly, nafs can designate the entire living h uman person (Blachère 1948, 75–76).\nThis signification applies, for instance, in Qur’anic passages speaking of the killing of a\nnafs (Q 2:72, 5:32, 6:151, 17:33, 18:74, 20:40, 25:68, 28:19.33; see also 5:45), in the asser-\ntion that “ every person” or “every one” (kullu nafsin) “ will taste death” (Q 3:185, 21:35,\n29:57; → dhāqa), or in the affirmation that God “charges no person beyond his or her\ncapability” (Q 2:286, 6:152, 7:42, 23:62: lā yukallifu llāhu / lā nukallifu nafsan illā wusʿahā;\ncf. 65:7).3 Another verse in which nafs means “person” or “ human life” is Q 2:155, accord-\ning to which God w ill test the believers “by fear and hunger and loss of possessions and\nlives and fruit (wa- naqṣin mina l- amwāli wa- l- anfusi wa- l- thamarāti).” The same applies\nto the phrase jāhadū bi- amwālihim wa- anfusihim, “to contend by means of their posses-\nsions and their lives” (e.g., Q 4:95; → jāhada, → aqraḍa). As Blachère and Homerin have\npersuasively argued, this second category should also be deemed to include eschatological\nstatements like Q 82:5, asserting that on the day of judgement “a person” (nafs)— meaning\n“ every person” (Blankinship 2020, 69–70)—“ will come to know what he/she has previ-\nously accomplished and failed to accomplish” (ʿalimat nafsun mā qaddamat wa- akhkharat;\nsee under → qaddama). That nafs h ere signifies “the person held responsible for his or her\nbeliefs and actions” rather than the soul is substantiated by Q 75:13 (yunabbaʾu l- insānu\nyawmaʾidhin bi- mā qaddama wa- akhkhar), a parallel to 82:5 that employs al- insān, “man,\n1 For a general overview that has also formed my own starting point, see CDKA 272, but note that Ambros\ncombines senses (i) and (ii). For an ambiguous example that can perhaps be construed according to e ither mean-\ning (i) or (iii), see Q 13:11: “God does not change what is in a p eople until they change what is in themselves /\nwhat is in their souls (mā bi- anfusihim).” A fivefold taxonomy of the meanings of nafs in the Qur’an is developed\nin Picken 2005, 106–107.\n2 My use of “vital self” as an approximate equivalent of nafs draws on Blachère 1948, 71–72, who employs\nparaphrases like principe vital and âme vegetative.\n3 The latter phrase has been compared to 1 Cor 10:13 (Rudolph 1922, 16; BEQ 451).\n682 nafs", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

A\nfurther passage in which nafs clearly has the sense of “person” is Q 91:7–8: “By the h uman\nperson and that which has given it an even shape (wa- nafsin wa- mā sawwāhā) // and has\ninstilled it with its wickedness and fear of God!”4 Lastly, when four verses remind the ad-\ndressees that God has created them min nafsin wāḥidatin (Q 4:1, 6:98, 7:189, 39:6), namely,\nfrom Adam, this too is best rendered “from a single person” rather than “from a single soul”\n(thus also Blachère 1948, 75, and Homerin 2006, 84). It is presumably based on the same\ninsight formulated by Blachère and Homerin that Asad 1980 almost always renders the\nuniversal quantifier kullu/kulli/kulla nafsin as “every/any h uman being” and that Paret’s\nGerman translation usually opts for “every one” (see, e.g., Q 3:30.185 in Paret 2001; simi-\nlarly Droge 2013, who usually has “every/each person” or “every one”).5 By contrast, when\nArberry or Abdel Haleem translate nafs in verses like Q 3:30 or 82:5 as “soul” (Arberry 1955\nand Abdel Haleem 2010), they risk encouraging an unwarranted understanding of Qur’anic\neschatology according to which God’s judgement and ensuing rewards and punishments\nbefall disembodied souls. As illustrated by Q 82:5, briefly examined above, nafsun in the\nindeterminate nominative singular can have a similar quantifying function to kullu/kulli/\nkulla nafsin; it occurs principally in universal negations,6 where it too is best understood as\n“any person.” Thus, “no person” or “no one” is “charged beyond his capacity” (lā tukallafu\nnafsun illā wusʿahā; Q 2:233),7 and on judgement day “no one w ill give satisfaction for any-\nbody e lse” (lā tajzī nafsun ʿan nafsin shayʾan; Q 2:48.123).8\nBy way of adding some comparative support for this second sense of nafs, an equivalent\nuse of the word in the sense of “life” or “person” is attested in early Arabic poetry (AHW\n142–143); and Sabaic nfs1, too, has been argued to mean “person” rather than “soul” (Jamme\n1988, 43; see also Jamme 1972, 77).9 A poetic occurrence of ilā kulli nafsin that evidently\nmeans “to every one” is found at the end of al- Shanfarā’s Qaṣīdah Ṭāʾiyyah (Lyall 1918–1924,\nno. 20:34; EAP 1:204), despite the fact that the immediately preceding verse employs nafs\nin the sense of “soul.” It is also worth drawing attention to a verse that Seidensticker cites\nfrom a poem attributed to Zuhayr, which underscores the ephemerality of p eople’s “lives\n4 The two following verses, Q 91:9–10, may be translated thus: “He who purifies it will surely prosper\n(qad aflaḥa man zakkāhā) // and he who sullies it will surely be reduced to destitution (wa-q ad khāba man\ndassāhā).” On khāba, see AEL 819; on dassā, the translation of which is conjectural, see CDKA 98. On qad, refer\nto the brief comment u nder → aflaḥa. Instead of a literal rendering of the anaphoric pronouns in man zakkāhā\nand man dassāhā (“he who purifies it,” “he who sullies it”), one might consider a reflexive translation: “he who\npurifies himself,” “he who sullies himself.” This is supported both by the fact that nafs is well attested as a reflexive\npronoun in the Qur’an, as explained under (iii) in the main text, and by the similarity between Q 91:9 and 87:14\n(qad aflaḥa man tazakkā, “he who purifies himself will prosper”).\n5 On such a rendering, a verse like Q 3:30 is to be translated: “On the day when every one will find brought\nforth the good he/she has done and the evil he/she has done . . .” (yawma tajidu kullu nafsin mā ʿamilat min\nkhayrin muḥḍaran wa- mā ʿamilat min sūʾin).\n6 For cases in which indeterminate nafsun without a preceding kull does not feature in negative sentences,\nsee Q 59:18, 81:14, and 82:5 (cited e arlier on in the main text). One is tempted to equate this usage with kullu\nnafsin, which is in fact how Q 81:14 and 82:5 are glossed in Jal. 2086 and 2090.\n7 As shown by verses like Q 2:286, cited further above, this par tic u lar claim is more frequently expressed\nin the active, with God as the grammatical subject and nafs figuring in the accusative.\n8 Once again, Paret 2001 consistently has niemand (“no one, anyone”), while Asad 1980 has “no human\nbeing.” See also the structure wa- mā kāna li- nafsin an . . . in Q 3:145 (“No person will die except by God’s per-\nmission,” wa- mā kāna li- nafsin an tamūta illā bi- idhni llāhi) and 10:100.\n9 I owe both references to http://s abaweb .u ni -j ena .d e /S abaWeb /S uche /S uche /S earchResultDetail\n?i dxLemma​=​2005&showAll​=​0 (accessed 1 April 2021), where par tic u lar occurrences can be found.

As illustrated by the last example, formulations in-\nvolving this reflexive use of nafs often serve to give pointed expression to the fundamental\nQur’anic contention that the consequences of virtuous or vicious actions w ill ultimately—\nthat is, eschatologically— rebound upon the agent (see also under → ẓalama).10 It seems\nlikely that this third, reflexive sense of nafs grew out of the preceding two.11\nThe nafs in relation to breath and blood. The noun nafas (which is Qur’anically\nunattested) means “breath,” and tanaffasa (see Q 81:18) is “to breathe” (Blachère 1948,\n69; Calverley 1993, 880; Homerin 2006, 81). This invites the conjecture that nafs may at\nsome point have meant the vital breath residing in a living person and departing him or\nher at the moment of death. However, while there is Qur’anic evidence for the notion\nthat death supervenes when the nafs leaves the body (Q 6:93, 39:42), in the Qur’an the\nidea of a vital spirit is more closely associated with the noun → rūḥ, which God is said to\nhave “breathed into” (nafakha fī) Adam (Q 15:29, 32:9, and 38:72).12 A line from a poem\nattributed, perhaps uncertainly, to al- Samawʾal ibn ʿĀdiyāʾ depicts the nafs as something\nthat “pours forth” on the edges of sword- blades or spear- heads (tasīlu ʿalā ḥaddi l- ẓubāti\nnufūsunā), suggesting that the nafs was connected not with the breath but rather with\nblood (Smith 1894, 40, n. 1; Blachère 1948, 72, n. 3; ʿAlī 1968–1973, 6:137; for the verse, see,\ne.g., al- Khaṭīb al- Tibrīzī 2000, no. 16:11, and Arberry 1965, 30–31, v. 11).13 A ḥadīth report,\nalso cited by ʿAlī, in which nafs sāʾilah clearly means “blood” may be seen as evidence\nthat this connotation persisted into the post- Qur’anic period (see, e.g., Abū ʿUbayd 1994,\n253 = no. 190). A similar tie with h uman blood applies to the cognate term nepeš in Biblical\nHebrew: as Lev 17:11 puts it, “the nepeš of the flesh is in the blood” (see also Deut 12:23),\nand the nepeš may accordingly be summarised as “the life force coursing through the\nblood of h umans and animals” (see Smith 1894, 40, and Homerin 2006, 82; for more detail\n10 Other cases of reflexive nafs include Q 2:110.223.272, 6:104, 9:35, 10:108, and 73:20. See also the mā/\nin . . . i llā anfusahum structures in Q 2:9 (wa- mā yakhdaʿūna illā anfusahum, “they only deceive themselves”),\n3:69, 4:113, and 6:26. Two other verses in which nafs simply functions as a reflexive are Q 3:28.30: “God warns\nyou about himself” (wa-y uḥadhdhirukumu llāhu nafsahu). The reflexive use of nafs is also found in early Arabic\npoetry, e.g., DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 16:57 (wa- man lā yukarrim nafsahu lā yukarramī).\n11 See, e.g., Q 12:53, which would seem to slide from meaning (iii) back to (i): “I do not claim myself to\nbe innocent (wa- mā ubarriʾu nafsī); indeed, the soul/self perpetually commands what is evil (inna l- nafsa la-\nammāratun bi- l- sūʾi).” Similarly, Q 16:111 combines meanings (ii) and (iii): “On the day when e very person (kullu\nnafsin) will plead for himself/herself (ʿan nafsihā), and every person (kullu nafsin) will be fully repaid what he/\nshe has done” (see also CDKA 272).\n12 See also Q 21:91 and 66:12, where it is Mary into whom God breathes his spirit, which describes the\nconception of Jesus.\n13 See also the discussion in AHW 159–160, who adds another prooftext yet is sceptical about positing a\nclose link between the nafs and blood.\n684 nafs", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The nepeš can also\nrepresent specifically “the desires and inclinations of animals and humans” (NIDOTTE\n3:133; see, e.g., Jer 2:24 and Prov 23:2), corresponding to the appetitive connotations of\nthe Qur’anic employment of nafs noted under (i) above (see already Calverley 1993, 880).\nUnlike the Biblical nepeš, however, it is only human agents to which the Qur’an would\nseem to ascribe a nafs. As will be argued below, the Qur’anic nafs is more likely to be\nlinked to the conception of the human soul or vital self that is enunciated in pre- Islamic\npoetry than to Biblical precursors.\nNo immaterial soul in the Qur’an. An unfortunate drawback of rendering nafs in the\nfirst sense above as “soul,” rather than “vital self,” is that it invites readers to associate the\nQur’an with a Platonistic understanding of h umans as dualistically constituted of a material\nbody and an immaterial soul capable of disembodied existence. While such a Platonising\nconception of the human soul had a strong influence on late antique Christian thought\n(see generally the contributions to the second part of Marmodoro and Cartwright 2018),\nthere is no unequivocal Qur’anic support for it (Rahman 2009, 17).14 The fact that, as noted\nabove, a human individual’s demise occurs when he or she “gives up” his or her vital self\n(nafs; Q 6:93, 39:42; see also 9:55.85) does not as such imply that it is a disembodied nafs\nwho is the vehicle of h umans’ posthumous existence. A fter all, the Qur’an emphasises that\nGod’s resurrection of humans involves a “clothing” of bones with flesh (Q 2:259: wa- nẓur\nilā l-ʿ iẓāmi kayfa nunshizuhā thumma naksūhā laḥman; cf. Ezek 37:1–14), just as God clothes\nbones with flesh when a human being is first brought into existence (Q 23:14: fa- kasawnā\nl- ʿiẓāma laḥman; on the resurrection as a revivification of bones, see also 36:78–79 and\nverses like 37:16.53). Th ere is no explicit Qur’anic evidence that the nafs that is surrendered\nat the moment of death is capable of existence outside a body.15\nSimilarly inconclusive is another potential piece of evidence in favour of a Platonis-\ning understanding of the Qur’anic afterlife. This is Q 81:7, which in the context of the\nend of the world and the last judgement appears to evoke the moment “when the souls\nwill be paired” (wa- idhā l- nufūsu zuwwijat). Some Muslim interpreters understand this\nstatement to mean the pairing of souls with bodies at the moment of resurrection (e.g.,\nṬab. 24:144–145; see also SQ 1480–1481). This could be understood to imply that h uman\nsouls are at least in princip le separable from bodies. Even so, Q 81:7 would nonetheless\nmake it unequivocally clear that the afterlife is experienced by h uman individuals who are\nconstituted of a soul and a body. It is equally conceivable, though, that Q 81:7 announces\na subdivision of the resurrected into groups or “kinds” (zawj in the singular) who have\naccumulated similar moral merit and therefore face the same eschatological fate (Homerin\n2006, 83–84; see also Ṭab. 24:141–144).16 On this interpretation, the meaning of nufūs in\nQ 81:7 is not “souls” but “persons,” yielding the translation like “when [all] persons will\nbe subdivided into dif er ent kinds.”\n14 On the question of whether the Qur’an may be read as positing a general distinction between material\nand immaterial spheres of existence, see under → al- ghayb and → allāh.\n15 Q 2:154, 3:169, and 36:26–28 intimate that certain meritorious individuals may be granted access to para-\ndise before the day of judgement (see also under → ākhir). However, given the evidence surveyed previously and\nbelow in the main text (including the fact that the Qur’an depicts paradise as involving appetites, designated by\nderivatives of the roots sh- h- w and h- w- y; e.g., Q 21:102), one must assume that the individuals in question enter\nparadise in an embodied or re- embodied state rather than as disembodied souls. Most likely, it is, exceptionally,\nunderstood that they will be resurrected prior to the general resurrection at the end of the world.\n16 For azwāj in the sense of eschatological “kinds,” see Q 56:7.\nnafs 685", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

What does the Qur’an\npermit us to infer about the functions and activities of the h uman nafs in sense (i)?17 In the\nfirst instance, the nafs is something hidden: h umans, including the Qur’anic Messenger,\nmay conceal (akhfā, asarra, akanna) the contents of their souls (Q 2:235.284, 3:154, 5:52,\n12:77, 33:37),18 yet God “knows what is in your souls” (Q 2:235, 11:31, 17:25; see also 2:284\nand 5:116), just as he knows what is in p eople’s “breasts” (singular: → ṣadr; e.g., Q 3:154;)\nor hearts (singular: → qalb; e.g., Q 4:63). More specifically, the soul or vital self emerges\nas the mental faculty giving rise to desires, cravings, and appetites. Several verses con-\nnect the nafs with the verb hawiya, “to desire,” or its corresponding verbal noun (see also\nunder → tabiʿa). Thus, Q 2:87 and 5:70 accuse the Israelites of dismissing God’s messengers\nas liars or killing them “whenever a messenger came to you with something that your souls\ndid not desire (bi- mā lā tahwā anfusukum)” (for other instances linking nafs and h- w- y, see\nQ 53:23 and 79:40).19 Other verses employ the plural of nafs as the grammatical subject of\nishtahā, a synonym of hawiya (Q 21:102, 41:31, 43:71; cf. AHW 155). Significantly, all of the\nlatter three passages describe how the pious in paradise w ill enjoy every thing “that their\nsouls desire,” implying that h uman subjects do not shed their vital selves in paradise or\nin hell.20 The fact that the inhabitants of paradise continue to feel soul- cravings that are\nhowever immediately satisfied while the damned are deprived of such gratification (see\nQ 34:54, threatening that the damned will be denied access to “what they desire”) sug-\ngests that the possession of a vital self by the inhabitants of paradise and hell is an integral\nprecondition of what ever joys or punishments the afterlife may hold.\nThat humans retain their souls or vital selves in the afterlife is particularly noteworthy\nsince the appetitive promptings of the nafs can clearly lead pre- eschatological humans\nto violate moral princi ples or the prohibition of venerating other beings than God. Thus,\naccording to Q 5:30 one of the sons of Adam—in Biblical terms, Cain— was “prompted\nby his soul to kill his brother” (fa- ṭawwaʿat lahu nafsuhu qatla akhīhi fa-q atalahu), and\nin Q 20:96 the enigmatic al- Sāmirī attempts to excuse his production of a calf-s haped\nidol for the Israelites by saying that “my soul persuaded me to do it” (wa-k a-d hālika\nsawwalat lī nafsī; for other occurrences of nafs + sawwala, see Q 12:18.83; on sawwala,\nrefer to CDKA 142). A third verb used for the soul’s morally dubious promptings is was-\nwasa, “to whisper”: “We created man (al-i nsān) and we know what his soul whispers to\nhim (wa-n aʿlamu mā tuwaswisu bihi nafsuhu), for we are closer to him than his jugular\nvein,” the divine voice asserts in Q 50:16. Significantly, both sawwala and waswasa are\nalso used with the devil or Satan (→ al-s hayṭān) as their grammatical subject (Witztum\n2011, 134–136; see Q 7:20, 20:120, 47:25, and also, though more enigmatically, 114:4–5): it\nappears that the nafs constitutes the primary breach in human psy chol ogy through which\nthe devil carries out his attempts to lead humans astray. That the nafs is an ethical liability\n17 See also AHW 154–157.\n18 See also Q 58:8 with the formulation “they say in their souls. . . .” In Q 7:205, wa- dhkur rabbaka fī nafsika\nwould seem to mean a quiet manner of invoking God that is not readily audible (→ dhakara).\n19 But see Q 14:37, where the root h- w- y in the sense of desire is associated with the heart (fuʾād).\n20 See also the occurrence of ishtahā in Q 52:22, 56:21, and 77:42 (also eschatological but without specifically\nmentioning souls). I consider it to be less probable that the point of t hese verses is to say that the blessed w ill\nenjoy every thing that their souls desired when they were still alive. Could the fact that Q 21:102, 41:31, and 43:71\nuse a dif er ent verb to refer to the soul’s desires in the afterlife than many verses speaking of the soul’s desires in\nthis world indicate that in paradise the appetitive operations of the nafs are somehow transformed? This seems\nunlikely, seeing that the verb ishtahā figures in a this- worldly (and disapproving) context in Q 16:57.\n686 nafs", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is\nnot unexpected, therefore, that the nafs is described as “perpetually commanding evil”\n(Q 12:53: inna l-n afsa la-a mmāratun bi-l -s ūʾi).\nNonetheless, it does not appear that all promptings originating from the nafs are intrin-\nsically evil (thus also AHW 155). Thus, Q 12:67 reports Jacob’s precautionary advice to his\nsons to enter what seems to be the capital city of Egypt by dif er ent gates, rather than by\nthe same one, and 12:68 calls this counsel a mere “feeling of need (ḥājah) in Jacob’s soul\nthat he satisfied” (ḥājatan fī nafsi yaʿqūba qaḍāhā).22 Similarly, there is not necessarily\nanything blameworthy about the fear that Moses feels “in his soul” according to Q 20:67\nwhen confronting the Egyptian sorcerers (fa- awjasa fī nafsihi khīfatan mūsā), even if God\nsubsequently encourages him not to be afraid (v. 68). In fact, one passage entails that the\nfeelings of disquietude and restlessness to which the nafs may give rise, far from being\nreligiously corruptive, as in Q 3:154 (see above), may psychologically dispose someone to\nrepentance: Q 9:118 describes the anguish felt by three unnamed contemporaries of the\nQur’anic Messenger who apparently failed to participate in a military excursion (see the\nremarks on khallafa under → istakhlafa) by saying that “their souls became straitened (wa-\nḍāqat ʿalayhim anfusuhum),23 and they thought that the only refuge from God was t owards\nhim; then he turned t owards them in compassion so that they might repent (thumma tāba\nʿalayhim li- yatūbū)” (see also AHW 144 and under → tāba). It stands to reason that the\nurges emanating from the nafs are not evil in themselves, but simply acquire this value if\nand when they conflict with and are allowed to override higher- ranking moral or religious\nprecepts. It is accordingly crucial to keep one’s soul or vital self in check. This applies even\nto the Qur’anic Messenger, whom Q 35:8 instructs not to let his soul feel regret for those\nwhom God has led astray (fa- lā tadhhab nafsuka ʿalayhim ḥasarātin).\nThe nafs, then, is the part of the human psyche from which selfish urges and impulses\nwell up. A moral agent must critically assess t hese urges and, if needs be, contain and re-\npress them: in order to merit paradise, one must “restrain the soul from desire” (wa- nahā\nl-n afsa ʿani l-h awā, Q 79:40), meaning, presumably, from t hose desires that the moral\nconscience identifies as illicit. Yet as just highlighted, the urges, apprehensions, and de-\nsires springing from the soul can at times be morally indiferent or even salubrious. What\ndistinguishes those leading a moral and pious life from those failing to do so is not that\n21 Prob ably under the influence of a prominent stream in traditional Islamic exegesis (see Ṭab. 23:469 or\nSQ 1446), Mir and Homerin interpret the phrase al- nafs al- lawwāmah in Q 75:2 as someone’s “ ‘blaming self’\nor conscience” (Mir 1987, 36; Homerin 2006, 83). But t here is no other Qur’anic verse suggesting that the nafs\nmight function as the human conscience, and given what other passages have to say about its activity the\nnafs seems singularly ill- equipped to play such a role. Moreover, at least some Qur’anic occurrences of the verb\nlāma or the reciprocal talāwama (Q 5:54, 12:32, 14:22, 68:30) carry the sense of gratuitous or petty fault-fi nding\nthat is also found in poetry (e.g., DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 4:69, on which see Jacobi 1971, 79–80; the translation in\nArberry 1957, 87 has “to scold”).

In line with\nthe Qur’an’s generally pessimistic anthropology (HCI 165–166), there is little evidence\nthat the desires and promptings of the soul can undergo permanent reform or alteration:\nit is the nafs in general that is said to “command evil” (Q 12:53), or to engender selfish and\npotentially immoral urges, rather than merely the nafs of some humans to the exclusion of\nothers. As we saw e arlier, even the resurrected are assumed to be endowed with vital selves\nor souls, underscoring the extent to which the Qur’an pre sents the nafs as an inseparable\ncomponent of the h uman experience. To be sure, t here is one Qur’anic passage that makes\nreference, in an eschatological context, to “the soul that is secure” or “at peace” (Q 89:27:\nyā- ayyatuhā l- nafsu l- muṭmaʾinnah), a formulation that some Muslim exegetes reasonably\ngloss as meaning a soul that “is secure in belief” (al- muṭmaʾinnah bi- l- īmān; e.g., Muqātil\n2002, 4:692; see also Ṭab. 24:398).24 The verse implies the possibility of a lasting trans-\nformation of the nafs from an unruly part of the human psyche that is constantly at risk of\ndisrupting a person’s moral and religious aspirations to a faculty that is fully in harmony\nwith his or her ethical values and theological convictions. Yet given other Qur’anic state-\nments about the human soul, the transformation that Q 89:27 designates with the verb\niṭmaʾanna is prob ably envisaged as occurring only at the eschatological stage, in the sense\nthat it is only upon entering paradise that the nafs will fi nally be subdued and made one\nwith the rest of the h uman person. Alternatively, the meaning of nafs in Q 89:27 could well\nbe the h uman person in its entirety—i .e., the second of the three meanings listed above—\nrather than specifically the soul or vital self (thus Asad 1980: “O thou human being that\nhast attained to inner peace!”).\nVital self and heart (qalb). The relationship between the soul or vital self (nafs) and the\nheart (→ qalb) deserves further comment. Although both are associated with the breast\n(for the heart and the breast, see, e.g., Q 3:154 and 22:46; for the soul and the breast, cf.\nQ 12:68 with 40:80 and 59:9), one can discern a general functional distinction between\nthem. As detailed elsewhere (→ qalb), the heart is frequently combined with cognitive or\nepistemic terminology, such as understanding (faqiha, ʿaqala), believing (āmana), reject-\ning (ankara), or doubting (irtāba). This is almost never the case for the nafs, which fits the\nobservation that the latter is primarily the wellspring of human desires, urges, aversions,\nand quasi-i nstinctual apprehensions and anx ie ties. An exceptional case in which the nafs is\nassociated with cognitive terminology is Q 27:14, according to which the Qur’an’s opponents\ndeny God’s signs “despite the fact that their souls w ere certain of them” (wa- stayqanathā\nanfusuhum; see also AHW 154). But the point h ere would seem to be that the opponents’\nminds are so perverted that they r ide roughshod over even their own souls’ disposition to\nassent to God’s signs; the verse polemically inverts the ordinary psychological situation in\nwhich an agent strug gles to assert his moral and religious values over the wayward leanings\nof his nafs.25 At least ordinarily, it is not the soul but the heart that forms the faculty by which\nhumans come to comprehend God’s signs and revelations and to enter into a relationship\n24 The argument in favour of this gloss is the connection between belief (āmana, īmān) and being secure\nor at peace (iṭmaʾanna, iṭmiʾnān) that is clearly exhibited by Q 2:260, 13:28, and 16:106.112.\n25 See also Q 30:8, which could be construed as asking w hether the opponents “have not reflected in their\nsouls” (a- wa- lam yatafakkarū fī anfusihim) on God’s creation of the heavens and the earth.

It is also relevant to note that the Qur’an exhibits a wide\nrange of expressions for the malfunctioning of the h uman heart (detailed u nder → qalb),\nwhich implies a strong distinction between the heart’s right and wrong operating. Such\nterminology has no counter parts with re spect to the nafs: the nafs has one intrinsic mode of\nfunctioning, rather than a right one and a wrong one; it inevitably gives rise to self- centred\ndesires and appetites, w hether in sinners or in the virtuous.\nThe nafs as depicted in pre- Islamic poetry. As the remainder of this entry will show,\npre- Islamic poetry depicts the nafs and its operations in broadly similar terms, forming\nan impor tant aspect of continuity between the Qur’an and those strands of ancient Ara-\nbian notions of the human psyche that are articulated in poetry (see also the overview of\npoetic evocations of the nafs in AHW 145–153). For example, the prominent Qur’anic link\nbetween the soul and desire (h- w-y ) is paralleled by a verse from the corpus of ʿAntarah\n(DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 2:20), in which the poet boasts of his nobility and asserts that he\ndoes not “follow the desires of the contentious soul” (lā atbaʿu l- nafsa l- lajūja hawāhā;\nsee also AHW 150). We see h ere the same theme of h uman agents needing to uphold the\nethical values in which they are invested (which are not, of course, theocentric ones as\nin the Qur’an) against the inclinations of their unruly and wayward vital selves. The same\nphraseological link underpins a verse by ʿAdī ibn Zayd, demanding that the soul’s desire be\nkept in check (wa- daʿi l- nafsa ʿan hawāhā; al-M uʿaybid 1965, no. 9:26; see AHW 150).26 The\nsoul also appears as the seat of internal agitation (humūm; cf. the use of the verb ahamma\nin Q 3:154, cited above) and as a source of “complaints about matters that fill it with dis-\nquiet” (aḥādītha nafsin tashtakī mā yarībuhā; DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 8:2; see Jacobi\n1971, 88). Moreover, by virtue of being the seat of the h uman instinct of self-p reservation,\nthe soul can pose a threat to the poet’s ability to conform to the heroic value system he\nis expected to uphold: the Muʿallaqah of Ṭarafah explic itly associates the soul with fear\n(khawf; DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 4:40; see Arberry 1957, 85, and AHW 147, including further\nmaterial), and according to other poems the soul “loathes” (kariha) death and charging\ninto b attle (DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 3:44; Lyall 1918–1924, no. 91:2; see also AHW 149),27 and\nit “blames” (lāma) its owner for actions imperiling his safety or comfort (Farrāj and Shākir\n1963–1965, 754 = al-B urayq, no. 6:1; cf. the Qur’anic oath by “the soul full of blame,” al- nafs\nal- lawwāmah, in Q 75:2).28 In b attle, men’s souls “come up between their collar-b ones”\n(Lyall 1913, ʿĀmir ibn al- Ṭufayl, no. 23:5: idhā mā nufūsu l- qawmi ṭālaʿati l- thughar; see also\nAHW 161), which recalls similar depictions of mortal fear in the Qur’an (Q 33:10, 40:18,\n56:83, 75:26).29 At the same time, just as the Qur’an on occasion pre sents the operations of\non humans. This would be in line with the meaning of tafakkara fī in Q 3:191 and the claim in 51:21 that there are\ndivine signs “in yourselves” (fī anfusikum).\n26 A verse attributed, perhaps correctly, to Umayyah ibn Abī l- Ṣalt (Schulthess 1911a, no. 55:28 = al-S aṭlī\n1974, no. 11:28) combines h-w -y not with the nafs but with the qalb (AHW 48; on the prob lem of the verse’s\nauthenticity, see Seidensticker 2011b, 62–63).\n27 I am assuming that the second verse refers to the souls of the warriors and not to those of their horses,\nwho are also mentioned.\n28 Although the context is slightly opaque, it seems that the act for which the poet’s soul blames him—\nnamely, to cover the body of someone whom he believes to have been unjustly slain, and thereby to claim\nresponsibility for exacting vengeance on behalf of the victim—is understood to be objectively noble but risky,\nmeaning that the soul cannot be said to function as the poet’s moral conscience h ere.\n29 Q 33:10 has balaghati l- qulūbu l-ḥ anājira, “the hearts reached the throats,” the context being an earthly b attle.\nQ 40:18 employs a variant of the phrase to convey the fear of the resurrected on the day of judgement.

Thus, ʿAntarah says that a victory in b attle\n“cured” (shafā) the “malady” (saqam) of his soul, adding the proviso “if it w ere pos si ble\nfor the soul to be cured.” By slaughtering his enemies, we may explicate, the poetic hero\nhas satisfied his soul’s thirst for blood and vengeance; yet the soul will inevitably go on\ngenerating further desires and yearnings demanding satisfaction in their turn (DSAAP,\nʿAntarah, no. 15:1, and al- Khaṭīb al- Tibrīzī 1992, 101; on the general link between “curing\nthe soul” and vengeance, see AHW 152–153).30\nThe preceding makes it clear that it is vital for a tribal warrior to exercise critical control\nover his soul, that is, to give reign only to t hose of its desires and aversions that are compat-\nible with the ethical code he is striving to embody, while conflicting appetites and dislikes\nmust be suppressed. “The soul complains about what has befallen it” (wa- tashakkā l- nafsu\nmā ṣāba bihā), Ṭarafah says,31 and then goes on to exhort his soul to “remain steadfast (fa-\nṣbirī), for you originate from a p eople who are steadfast” (DSAAP, Tarafah, no. 5:34; see\nalso AHW 148 and u nder → ṣabara).32 In his Muʿallaqah, Ṭarafah reminisces about “many\na day on which I restrained my soul in the throng of b attle” (wa- yawmin ḥabastu l- nafsa\nʿinda ʿirākihā; DSAAP, Tarafah, no. 4:99).33 ʿAntarah too boasts of his ability to “stead-\nfastly restrain” (ṣabartu) his soul, which w ill “stand firm when a coward’s soul is given to\nyearning” (tarsū idhā nafsu l-j abbāni taṭallaʿu; DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 13:8).34 The same\nverse describes the poet’s soul as privy to his own knowledge that he w ill not be able to\nescape what ever doom may be apportioned to him (ṣabartu ʿārifatan li- dhālika, referring\nback to v. 7). Yet it is not certain that the soul is always capable of such unflinching ac cep-\ntance of the misery, hardship, and danger besetting h uman existence. In asserting control\nover one’s soul, one may therefore need to have recourse to self- deceit: another poem by\nʿAntarah accuses his soul of having “lied” to him in holding out the prospect of a tryst with\na certain w oman, and he consequently tells himself to “lie” to his soul in turn (kadhabatka\nnafsuka fa- kdhibanhā; DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 23:6). H ere, a h uman agent’s relationship to\nhis soul is represented on the model of interpersonal conflict and deception.35 The need\nto exercise steadfast control over (ṣabara) one’s soul, especially in b attle, also features in\nmay evoke the moment when a dying person’s soul “reaches the throat” (idhā balaghati l-ḥ ulqūm). Although the\ngrammatical subject is unspecified, the feminine verb suggests that the intended subject is nafs rather than qalb.\nThe same holds for Q 75:26: idhā balaghati l- tarāq(- iya), “when it [the soul] reaches the collar-b ones.”\n30 See also DSAAP, ʿAntarah, no. 21:78, describing how the poet’s soul was “cured” and its “malady,” suqm,\nhealed when his victorious advance in b attle was cheered on by his brothers-i n- arms; see al- Khaṭīb al- Tibrīzī\n1992, 184–185, and the translation in Arberry 1957, 183. For a case in which similarly uncurable (sh- f- y) rancour\nand blood- thirst are associated with the heart (fuʾād) and “the breasts,” see Lyall 1918–1924, no. 27:13.15. In Lyall\n1918–1924, nos 38:4 and 57:10, the poet’s “sick heart” (qalb saqīm) functions as a meta phor for his yearning for\nhis past beloved.\n31 For another verse linking the nafs with a derivative of sh-k -w , see DSAAP, al- Nābighah, no. 8:2, cited\nearlier in the main text.\n32 For another instance in which the poet addresses his soul, see Lyall 1913, ʿĀmir ibn al- Ṭufayl, no. 11:11:\n“Cut short your exultation (aqillī l- mirāḥa); I do not fail to carry out my purpose.”\n33 Arberry translates “Many’s the day I’ve braced myself . . .” (Arberry 1957, 89).\n34 On ṣabara + al- nafs, see also al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 16:34.\n35 On lying to the soul, see also a famous line in a poem attributed to Labīd (ʿAbbās 1962, no. 26:22): “Lie\nto the soul when you speak to it; telling the soul the truth is to hold hope in contempt.” Although the poem is\nnot likely to be pre- Islamic (Montgomery 1997, 250–252; Imhof 2004, 82–103), the verse and the glosses around\nit assist in understanding the notion at stake: one must deceive one’s soul about the hardship and danger one\nis likely to encounter, as the soul’s ability to strive would other wise be impaired. On the soul as itself peddling\nlies, see ʿAbbās 1962, no. 2:1: “My view is that the soul is obstinate (lajjat) in deceitful hope (fī rajāʾin mukadh-\n690 nafs", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In early Islamic poetry, and to a residual degree also in the Qur’an (see\nin more detail u nder → ṣabara), the virtue of steadfastness (ṣabr) is therefore the ability\nto keep one’s soul in check.36 On the other hand, an unchecked soul may cause its owner\nto commit moral transgressions, just as Cain is prompted by his soul to kill his brother\n(Q 5:30): a poem by al-N ābigah alluding to a man’s compact of non-a gression with a snake\ncasts the protagonist’s violation of their agreement in terms of “being made to deviate by a\nsoul deviating from what is right” (jārat bihi nafsun ʿani l-ḥ aqqi jāʾirah; DSAAP, al- Nābigah,\nno. 15:10; see also AHW 151, quoting another verse that casts the soul in a similar role).\nIn sum, the Qur’anic conception of the nafs displays significant intersection with pre-\nIslamic poetry. The situation is very dif er ent with regard to the Qur’anic notion of the\nheart (qalb), which shows a considerable imprint of Biblical ideas and language (→ qalb).\nThe overall understanding of the human psyche under lying the Qur’an thus synthesises\nconcepts and diction associated with two very dif er ent literary traditions. This genealog-\nical assessment, however, must not be mistaken for a verdict of inconsistent eclecticism.\nOn the contrary, the Qur’an’s conflictual model of h uman psy chol ogy, which pits two\ndif er ent mental faculties against one another, is organically integrated with the Qur’an’s\ngeneral stress on moral strug gle in pursuit of eschatological reward.\nnafaʿa tr./intr. | to benefit or profit s.o.; to be of benefit or profitable\nmanfaʿ | benefit\nFurther vocabulary discussed: ḥajj | pilgrimage m in dūn allāh | b esides God; instead\nof God ʿ abada tr. | to serve s.o. or s.th., to worship s.o. or s.th. daʿā tr. | to call upon\ns.o. ḍ arra tr. | t o harm s.o. s hafāʿah | intercession d hikrā | ( hortatory) reminder,\nreminding exhortation\nThe beneficial nature of God’s creation. Many Qur’anic passages underscore that the\nworld and the creatures populating it operate in a way that “benefits” (nafaʿa) humans or\nbestows “benefits” (manāfiʿ, singular: manfaʿ) upon them (Q 2:164.219, 13:17, 16:5, 23:21,\n36:73, 40:80, 57:25). This exemplifies the far- reaching anthropocentrism of the Qur’anic\nportrayal of the earth (see in more detail under → arḍ and also under → āyah). A similar\nutilitarian focus is extended to the Meccan pilgrimage (Q 22:28.33): the ritual of the → ḥajj\nis not merely an act of obedience that is owed to God (cf. Q 3:97) but rather is in some sense\nadvantageous and profitable to h uman worshippers. In part based on such statements, a\nstrand of the later Muʿtazilite school inferred that God invariably takes the course of action\nthat is maximally beneficial to humans, whether in matters to do with their ultimate salva-\ntion or to do with their this-w orldly existence (e.g., Gimaret 1990, 434–435; see also ibid.,\ndhibī), // even though it has gathered experiences [to the contrary]; if only it w ere guided by experience (law\ntaqtadī bi- l- mujarrabī).”\n36 See also Q 12:18.83, both of which have Jacob tells his sons that “your souls have persuaded you of some-\nthing” (bal sawwalat lakum anfusukum amran) and then recommends having recourse to steadfastness instead\n(fa-ṣ abrun jamīlun). For a verse of early Arabic poetry in which steadfastness is associated with the heart, see\nEAP 1:35 (v. 11).

{"source_id": "SRC:SINAI_KEY_TERMS", "chunk_id": "p:714", "title": "Page 714", "locator": "pdf_page:714", "text": "449). The Qur’an’s attention to the ubiquitously beneficial nature of the cosmos continues a\nline of thought g oing back at least as far as the second- century Christian writer Theo philus\nof Antioch, who observes that what he terms the “resurrection of seeds and fruits” occurs\n“for the benefit (eis tēn chrēsin) of mankind” (Ad Autolycum 1:13 = Theo philus 1970, 16–17).\nThe unprofitability of worshipping deities besides God and the theme of eschato-\nlogical profit. There are two further thematic contexts in which the root n- f-ʿ has a strong\npresence. First, the Qur’an criticises the veneration (verb: → ʿabada) or invocation (verb:\ndaʿā) of beings “besides” or “instead of” God (min dūn allāh, on which see Ambros 2001,\n11–13)—of beings, that is, who are said to be neither capable of benefitting (nafaʿa) nor\nof harming (ḍarra) people or even themselves (e.g., Q 5:76, 6:71, 10:18.106, 13:16, 21:66,\n22:12–13, 25:3.55, 26:73; see also 20:89). As Ahrens recognised long ago (CQ 46; cf. BEQ\n445), the Qur’an here continues a well- established Biblical trope, the futility or unprofit-\nability of idol worship (TDOT 6:144–147). Thus, 1 Sam 12:21, Isa 44:9–10 and 57:12, and\nJer 2:8.11 and 16:19 all stress that idols do not “profit” (Hebrew: hôʿîl) their worshippers.\nIn the Qur’an, the formulaic conjunction of n- f-ʿ and ḍ- r- r also occurs as part of an idiom\nfor powerlessness (e.g., Q 7:188, 48:11).\nSecondly, a cluster of Qur’anic occurrences is specifically concerned with the issue\nof what will and will not be beneficial or profitable to humans on the day of judgement:\nhumans w ill not benefit from wealth or c hildren (Q 26:88, 60:3); they will not benefit from\nany intercession (shafāʿah) or at least from intercessors who are not authorised by God\n(Q 2:123, 20:109, 34:23, 74:48); p eople will be unable to benefit one another (Q 34:42);\nbelieving only at the point at which God’s punishment begins to unfold will be of no ben-\nefit (Q 6:158, 32:29, 40:85); the sinners w ill derive no benefit from their excuses (Q 30:57,\n40:52); and the fact that the wrongdoers are partners-i n-p unishment w ill not benefit them\n(Q 43:39). On the positive side, h umans w ill derive soteriological benefit from truthfulness\n(Q 5:119); and a number of early Meccan verses stress the profitability of God’s reminding\nexhortation (al-d hikrā; see under → dhakkara) as relayed by Muhammad, presumably\nintending its utility on the path to salvation (Q 51:55, 80:4, 87:9). That belief is beneficial\nor profitable is also asserted in Q 10:98. This Qur’anic theme of soteriological benefit and\nthe risk of lacking it might remind one of Matt 16:26: “For what will it profit humans (ti\ngar ōphelēthēsetai anthrōpos) if they gain the w hole world but forfeit their life?” (cf. Mark\n8:36 and Luke 9:25).1\nanfaqa tr./intr. | to spend (s.th.)\nFurther vocabulary discussed: razaqa ditr. | t o provide s.o. with s.th. r izq | p rovision\nzakāh | alms ṣ adaqah | g ift or act of charity w affā tr. ilā | t o repay s.th. to s.o. in full\nVari ous Qur’anic passages, both Meccan and Medinan, urge Muhammad’s listeners to\n“spend” (anfaqa) from what God has “provided (razaqa) for” them (e.g., Q 2:3.254, 4:39,\n8:3, 13:22, 14:31, 28:54, 35:29, 36:47, 42:38). “Spending” is thus synonymous with charitable\ngiving, also referred to by the terms → zakāh, “alms,” and → ṣadaqah, “gift/act of charity.”\n1 For other New Testamental references to “benefit” in religious m atters, see 1 Cor 13:3, Gal 5:2, and Heb\n4:2 and 13:9.\n692 anfaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Not only were the possessions disbursed in\ncharitable spending originally bestowed by God, but what ever the believers spend during\ntheir earthly lives w ill ultimately be “fully repaid” (waffā) to them in the hereafter (Q 2:272:\nmā tunfiqū min khayrin yuwaffa ilaykum; similarly 8:60; see u nder → ajr).

Also in the Medinan surahs, the antithesis between believers and repudiators is\nfurther blunted by a fluid intermediate category of persons who appear to be nominal\nmembers of the Qur’anic community yet whose religious commitment is judged to be\ninsufficient in vari ous regards (Sinai 2015–2016, 58–59). The most frequent label for them\nis “the hypocrites” (al- munāfiqūn, e.g., Q 4:61.88.138 etc., 8:49, 9:64.67–68.73.101, 29:11;\nless frequently, alladhīna nāfaqū, see Q 3:167 and 59:11). The corresponding verbal noun\nnifāq occurs in Q 9:77.97.101.\nQur’anic of munāfiq and Ethiopic manāfәq. It is conventional to render al- munāfiqūn\nas “hypocrites.” The word has long been assumed to be derived from the Classical Ethiopic\nnoun manāfәq, “heretic, schismatic, hypocrite,” and the verb nāfaqa, which can mean “to\nhave doubts, be unbelieving, be a heretic” (NB 48–49; KU 64–65; CQ 41–42; FVQ 272; on\nthe Ethiopic words, see Leslau 1991, 388). Brocket objects that the occurrence of the word\nin pre- Qur’anic Ethiopic lit er a ture remains to be confirmed (Brockett 1993, 562). However,\nthe general link of the Ethiopic root n- f- q with the notions of division, factionalism, and half-\nheartedness is attested by a significant number of derivatives (Leslau 1991, 388), whereas in\nArabic this meaning is confined to the verb nāfaqa (AEL 3036). This state of afairs is well\nexplained by the standard hypothesis of borrowing from Ethiopic into Arabic.\nAl- munāfiqūn = “the hypocrites.” Brocket also proposes that the Qur’anic significance\nof munāfiqūn is best rendered by “dissenters” (Brockett 1993, 562), while Ahrens prefers\n“waverers,” noting that this is one of the pos si ble meanings of Ethiopic nāfaqa (CQ 42).\nThe customary translation “hypocrite” does however capture well that the Qur’an takes the\nal- munāfiqūn, alladhīna nāfaqū 693", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

It is true that the munāfiqūn are\nsometimes also presented as explic itly challenging the believers or the Qur’anic Prophet\n(Q 8:49, 33:12), but the imputation could be that such views are voiced in private.1 Else-\nwhere, the hypocrites are portrayed as paying lip ser vice to the authority of the Qur’anic\nProphet and as participating in prayer, yet are alleged to do so disingenuously (Q 63:1,\n4:142); they are condemned for making excuses to justify their reluctance to “fight on\nGod’s path” (verb: qātala fī sabīl allāh; see Q 3:167 and 33:13–14) and for dismissing the\nbelievers as having been misled by “God and his Messenger” (Q 33:12, similarly 8:49); and\nthey are criticised for being miserly (Q 9:67), meaning presumably an unwillingness to\nundertake the charitable “spending” (→ anfaqa) that is demanded in Q 2:3.195.215.219.261–\n267 etc. The hypocrites are moreover reprimanded for fraternising with the repudiators\n(Q 4:139) and with the scripture- owners (Q 5:52, 59:11), thereby violating the demand that\nthe Qur’anic believers observe a degree of social segregation from these rivalling groups\n(e.g., Q 3:28, 4:144, 5:51.55.57, 8:72–75, 9:23, 60:1–9).\n“ Those in whose hearts is sickness.” Possibly an alternative expression for the\nhypocrites is the phrase “ those in whose hearts is sickness” (allādhīna fī qulūbihim\nmaraḍ; → maraḍ). Minimally, both expressions serve as liminal categories subsuming\nthose who are neither fully within nor fully outside the Qur’anic community. They thereby\nsupplement and stabilise a dichotomic contrast between believers and repudiators, by\naccommodating those aspects of the Medinan Qur’an’s social context that w ere not easily\nclassifiable as either belief or repudiation yet could be viewed as having some degree of\naffinity with either— consisting, for instance, in the mere display of certain outward fea-\ntures of belief or in continuing to maintain significant social relations outside the Qur’anic\ncommunity. At the same time, the Medinan Qur’an exhibits a certain tendency to collapse\nthe liminal category of the hypocrites back into the fundamental antithesis of believers\nand repudiators, by assimilating the hypocrites with the negative pole of this opposition\n(Q 4:140, 9:68.73, 33:1.48.73, 48:6, 66:9, 74:31).2 Arguably, this shifting nature of the cat-\negory of hy poc risy manifests the tension resulting from the Qur’an’s proclivity to impose\ndichotomic concepts on a heterogeneous social real ity.\nA Meccan occurrence? Although virtually all references to the hypocrites are found in\nMedinan surahs, the term also occurs in the Meccan verse Q 29:11, following an indictment\nof those who disingenuously profess belief in v. 10 that shows significant phraseological\noverlap with Q 2:8. It cannot of course be ruled out in princi ple that a prominent Medinan\nconcept might already have made a first appearance prior to the hijrah. Nonetheless, it is\nalso conceivable that Q 29:10–11 are a l ater rider added to the promise of divine reward for\nthe believers in Q 29:9, designed to clarify that the mere speech act of professing belief is\nnot in itself soteriologically sufficient.\nnaqaḍa tr. | to violate s.th.

But such precursors\ndemonstrate merely the relatively inconsequential fact that the consonantal root h-j -r\npredates the Qur’an.

This is also supported by the idea’s nearly complete\nabsence from the Meccan surahs.\nThe notion of emigration in the Medinan surahs. Many Medinan passages refer col-\nlectively to “the emigrants” (al- muhājirūn, Q 9:100.117, 24:22, 33:6, 59:8; 4:100 has man\nyuhājir fī sabīli llāhi) or “ those who emigrate / have emigrated” (alladhīna hājarū; see\nQ 2:218, 3:195, 8:72.74.75, 9:20, 22:58).3 The term is clearly an accolade, and there are a\nsignificant number of verses in which emigrating and believing (→ āmana) are closely\nlinked, giving the impression that emigration is a crucial manifestation of true faith (Q 2:218,\n8:72.74.75, 9:20, 33:6, 60:10; see also Crone 1994b, 354). Passages employing the verb\nhājara do not explic itly specify “that emigration must go to a par tic u lar place, be it in\nArabia or elsewhere, in order to count as hiǧra” (Crone 1994b, 366). Still, a handful of\nverses— which admittedly do not employ hājara— associate the community of believers\nwith a settlement referred to as al- madīnah, “the town” (Q 9:101.120, 33:60, 63:8), and one\nverse appears to identify the town in question as Yathrib (Q 33:13). The latter name also\nappears in the so- called Constitution of Medina (Lecker 2004, § 1). It is thus al- madīnah or\nYathrib where the Qur’anic “emigrants” dwell a fter having been “expelled” (verb: akhraja)\nfrom their previous abode (Q 2:191, 3:195, 8:30, 9:40, 22:40, 59:8, 60:1.8–9), though the\nquestion w hether the Qur’anic understanding of emigration necessarily requires move-\nment to Yathrib/Medina remains to be examined in more detail below.\nIn Medina itself, the post- emigration Qur’anic community seems to have had a two-\ntiered structure, dividing into new arrivals and Yathrib’s native population. Thus, Q 8:72.74\ndistinguish those who believe (alladhīna āmanū), emigrate, and “contend” (→ jāhada)\n“on God’s path (→ sabīl),” on the one hand, from those who have “sheltered and helped”\nthem, on the other. Elsewhere, the latter are more concisely labelled “the helpers” (al-\nanṣār; Q 9:100.117), a title also applied to the disciples of Jesus (Q 3:52, 61:14). But despite\nthe apostolic prec e dent, the gradient of merit must have been clearly slanted in favour of\nthe emigrants, who had proven their loyalty to God and his Messenger by paying the price\nof exile. That the emigrants were perceived as a separate group within the wider Medi-\nnan community of believers, considered to form a quasi- tribal unit among themselves, is\nconfirmed by the Constitution of Medina, according to which the Medinan community\nwas composed of “the emigrants from Quraysh” (Lecker 2004, § 3) in addition to vario us\nindigenous Medinan tribes, cata logued in §§ 4–11. In contrast to the Qur’anic verses just\ncited, however, the Constitution does not explic itly subsume t hese native tribes u nder the\noverarching rubric of “the helpers.”4\nQ 8:72.74 illustrate that Medinan references to emigration are sometimes coupled\nwith references not only to believing but also to “contending” (jāhada) or fighting “on\nGod’s path” (see also Q 2:218, 8:75, 9:20; for hājara + jāhada, see also 16:110).5 Also telling\n2 This is not to overlook that the main contours of Qur’anic militancy in general bear resemblance to aspects\nof the Biblical tradition (HCI 192–196).\n3 The temporal valence of alladhīna hājarū (“t hose who emigrate” or “t hose who have emigrated”), like that\nof similar expressions (e.g., alladhīna ẓalamū, alladhīna fasaqū), is not simply determined by the presence of the\nsuffix conjugation but must be assessed based on context; see Reuschel 1996, 144–145. Q 16:41.110 are prob ably\nMedinan insertions; see Neuwirth 2007, 300–301.\n4 But note the verb naṣara and the verbal noun naṣr in §§ 15, 18, 25, 45, 48, 54, 55.\n5 Q 16:110, though found in a Meccan surah, is Medinan (see also Neuwirth 2007, 301).\nhājara 697", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence, to emigrate\nwas accompanied by, and perhaps increasingly inseparable from, a religiously grounded\ncommitment to engage in militancy against the Meccan unbelievers and associators\n(HCI 188–196). The need to fight the unbelievers is itself presented as a response to prior\nvictimisation, namely, the fact that the Medinan emigrants were “expelled from their\nhomes” (ukhrijū min diyārihim; Q 3:195, 22:39–40, 59:8). Q 2:191 permits the inference\nthat the place from which the emigrants and the Qur’anic Messenger were originally\nexpelled is Mecca, in line with the standard Islamic narrative of origins (HCI 49–50),\nalthough the verse speaks of “expulsion” rather than of “emigration.” But it is clear that\nemigration was not just a one- of event and that it continued after the Messenger and\nhis adherents first reached Medina or Yathrib: Q 4:97–100, discussed below, document\nthat the expectation that believers in the Qur’anic revelations would emigrate remained\noperative throughout the Medinan period. The same follows from Q 60:10, which holds\nthat believing women who have emigrated to Medina, apparently after the initial influx\nof Qur’anic believers, must not be returned to their previous home. The Qur’anic no-\ntion of emigration is thus not limited to the Messenger’s initial relocation from Mecca\nto Yathrib, as might be suggested by the customary later fashion of referring to “the”\nhijrah. In fact, the expression “the hijrah” (al-h ijrah) does not occur in the Qur’an at all\n(as noted in Crone 1994b, 354).\nQ 4:97–100 and the question w hether emigration necessarily entails relocation to\nYathrib. Q 59:9 stresses the afection that is felt by the original inhabitants of the Qur’anic\ncommunity’s pre sent “abode” (al- dār) for t hose who have “emigrated t owards them” (yuḥib-\nbūna man hājara ilayhim). But statements combining hājara with the preposition ilā (“to”)\nare other wise very rare in the Qur’an.6 This could, of course, simply reflect the understand-\ning that acts of emigration are self- evidently directed at joining the Prophet’s community\nin Yathrib. But the lack of explicit specification does leave open the alternative that the link\nbetween the act of emigration and any par tic ul ar destination might be a much looser one.\nBy way of support for this alternative interpretation, one might cite the initial segment\nof Q 4:100: “He who emigrates on God’s path w ill find the earth to contain many a place\nof refuge and to be wide (yajid fī l- arḍi murāghaman kathīran wa- saʿatan).” According to\nMuslim lexicographers, rāghama + acc. is “to leave, abandon, forsake, or separate o.s. from\ns.o.” (AEL 1113),7 and it appears that the Qur’an h ere concedes that t here are many places to\nwhich believers may legitimately emigrate, meaning that moving to Yathrib is not “intrinsic\nto the Qurʾānic conception of emigration” (thus Crone 1994b, 366). But Q 4:100 continues\nas follows: “And he who goes forth from his h ouse, emigrating to God and his Messenger\n(wa- man yakhruj min baytihi muhājiran ilā llāhi wa-r asūlihi), and is then overtaken by\ndeath— God w ill be liable for his wage. God is forgiving and merciful.” In this second half\nof Q 4:100, the reference to emigration “to God and his Messenger” suggests that the act of\n6 The only other case apart from Q 4:100, discussed in what follows, is 29:26 (on which see the final section\nof the entry), where Abraham announces his intention to emigrate “to my Lord.” But there is of course no reason\nto assume that the implied destination here is Yathrib.\n7 On the noun murāgham itself, see AEL 1114.\n698 hājara", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Q 4:100 caps of a brief verse group be-\nginning in Q 4:97, whose basic theme would seem to be the eschatological fate of t hose who\ndie before managing to emigrate. According to v. 97, such p eople w ill in the hereafter profer\nthe excuse that they had been “oppressed on earth” (kunnā mustaḍʿafīna fī l- arḍi), to which\nit w ill be replied: “Was God’s earth not wide enough (a- lam takun arḍu llāhi wāsiʿatan)\nsuch that you could emigrate on it?”8 Verses 98–99 mitigate this harsh pronouncement by\nallowing that t hose who w ere truly unable to leave may be pardoned by God a fter all. The\nfirst part of Q 4:100 then guards against an overly generous application of this proviso by\nreminding the recipients that even if t here are obstacles preventing someone from joining\nthe Qur’anic ummah in Yathrib, t hose who find themselves in a social milieu in which the\nworship of beings other than God is rife may still be able to depart to some other place than\nYathrib. The second part of Q 4:100 then goes on to consider t hose who do actually set out\nfor Yathrib yet are overcome by death on the way. The entire passage thus proceeds along\nan ordered sequence considering vario us scenarios falling short of successful emigration\n“to God and his Messenger”: some p eople may not be able to leave at all; o thers may be\nable to leave, but not for Yathrib; yet o thers may be able to leave for Yathrib, but do not\nsucceed in reaching it alive. The impor tant t hing to take away, though, is that the implied\ngradation between t hese dif ere nt situations entails and confirms that the ideal outcome is\none in which emigration does indeed end with arrival in Yathrib. This is hardly surprising,\nfor the Prophet’s community would naturally have acted as a focal point attracting t hose\nwho were sufficiently invested in the Qur’anic kerygma in order to extricate themselves from\ntheir native social context. That this is indeed the default paradigm is also corroborated by\nQ 60:10, which prohibits the believers from sending back believing w omen “who have come\nto youp as emigrants” (idhā jāʾakumu l- muʾminātu muhājirātin): the natur al destination of\nemigration is Yathrib, where emigrants would join a community led by God’s Messenger. As\nthe second half of Q 4:100 intimates, this would bring them into uniquely close proximity\nto God himself: to emigrate to Medina is not just to join Muhammad, but to emigrate “to\nGod” as well (Q 4:100: muhājiran ilā llāhi wa- rasūlihi). By contrast, any other destination\nof emigration w ill at most aford a provisional haven of safety (Q 4:100: murāgham) where\n“oppressed men, w omen, and c hildren” (Q 4:98: al- mustaḍʿafīna mina l-r ijāli wa- l- nisāʾi\nwa- l- wildāni) are able to escape religious persecution.\nThe Qur’anic understanding of emigration is therefore ideally and paradigmatically\ndeparture to the Medinan community presided over by God and his Messenger. Yet the\nlatitude that Q 4:100 leaves for emigrating to other places is not insignificant: it would\nhave facilitated impor tant post- Qur’anic developments in the usage of hājara and its\nderivatives— namely, their use to designate the movement of fighters to garrison cities out-\nside Arabia and the fact that the title “the emigrants” (al- muhājirūn) became an impor tant\nearly post- Qur’anic self- designation of the Arab conquerors, as reflected both by Islamic\nsources and by Greek and Syriac ones (Crone 1994b; Lindstedt 2015). Other facets of the\nQur’anic use of hājara would have lent further support to this post- Qur’anic extension of\n8 The noun saʿah in Q 4:100 must hark back to wāsiʿatan in 4:97. In line with my translation of Q 4:100 above,\nsaʿah thus refers to the wideness of God’s earth rather than to the abundance of divine provision found therein\n(as one might infer from other occurrences of saʿah, such as Q 4:130).

Although virtually all references to emigration\nare datable to the Medinan period, there is one likely Meccan instance of the concept\nin Q 29:26, where Abraham declares, after having been delivered by God from his\nidolatrous compatriots (Q 29:24), that he will “emigrate to my Lord” (innī muhājirun\nilā rabbī; see HCI 180–181). The verse raises the possibility that the Qur’anic commu-\nnity would have viewed its eventual relocation from Mecca to Medina as re- enacting\nAbraham’s migration to the Promised Land (rather than, as might perhaps have been\nexpected, as a re- enactment of the Israelite Exodus). Quite possibly, the diction of\nQ 29:26, which came to determine the way in which the Medinan proclamations ref-\nerence the believers’ departure from Mecca, builds on earlier traditions. Thus, Gen\n12:4.5 describes Abraham’s departure from his home with the verb yāṣāʾ, “to go out, to\ndepart” (Peshitta: nfaq; Septuagint: exerchomai), as does Gen. Rab. 39:7.8, and Philo of\nAlexandria repeatedly describes Abraham’s departure from his homeland as an act of\napoikia or emigration (see Philo, On Abraham = Lanzinger 2020, §§ 66, 68, 72, 77, 85, and\nthe separate treatise Philo devoted to the topic: On the Migration of Abraham = Niehof\nand Feldmeier 2017). The use of hājara in Q 29:26 may consequently echo Hebrew yāṣāʾ\nor one of its vari ous equivalents in other ancient languages. Interestingly, at least one\nQur’anic verse, Q 4:100, similarly employs the most obvious literal equivalent of Hebrew\nyāṣāʾ in Arabic— namely, kharaja—in connection with hājara (man yakhruj min baytihi\nmuhājiran ilā llāhi wa-r asūlihi, “he who goes forth from his house, emigrating to God and\nhis Messenger”). While Q 4:100 does not mention Abraham, its use of hājara together\nwith the preposition ilā and God as the propositional object recalls the phraseology\nof Abraham’s statement in Q 29:26 (innī muhājirun ilā rabbī). By way of a final remark\non Q 29:26, it is noteworthy that the verse specifies that Lot “believed” Abraham, thus\nprefiguring the Medinan surahs’ recurrent association of emigration and belief.\nhadā tr./intr. | to guide (s.o.)\nihtadā intr. | to be guided\nhudā | guidance\nFurther vocabulary discussed: ṣirāṭ | road s abīl | way, path ḍ alla intr.

By contrast, my reading of the Qur’anic data largely endorses the view that the\nQur’anic meaning of hājara is what Crone calls the “classical” one (even if it is impor tant to note that the Qur’an\nenvisages emigration as an ongoing real ity rather than a one- off act datable to 622 CE).

The immediate conceptual network\nin which it is enmeshed also includes its opposite, the notion of human straying (→ ḍalla)\nand divine leading astray (aḍalla). More generally, the contrast between guidance and\nstraying belongs together with a number of other conceptual oppositions by which the\nQur’an encodes h uman existence in pervasively polar terms, especially belief (→ āmana)\nand “repudiation” (→ kafara). Guidance and being astray can also be meta phor ically rep-\nresented by sightedness and blindness (→ ʿamiya) or by health and sickness of the heart\n(→ maraḍ).\nGuidance in pre- Qur’anic poetry and the Biblical tradition. In pre- Islamic poetry,\nderivatives of h- d- y— whose original Qur’anic pronunciation may have difered from their\nclassical one1— occur in the context of guidance, orientation, and tracking in the desert\n(GMK 144–146, citing a verse from the Lāmiyyat al-ʿ arab attributed to al- Shanfarā, found\nin EAP 1:152–153, and another verse from the dīwān of ʿAbīd corresponding to Lyall 1913,\nʿAbīd, no. 21:12).2 Poetry can also employ the root h- d- y to connote leadership in a mili-\ntary context (Lyall 1894, 138 = v. 62 of the Muʿallaqah of al- Ḥārith ibn Ḥillizah; cf. Arberry\n1957, 225; see also Labīd in ʿAbbās 1962, no. 3:3). Such a usage is already found in a Safaitic\ninscription (Al- Jallad 2015a, 281 = SIJ 293). The Qur’an occasionally employs derivatives of\nh- d- y in a non- religious sense that is continuous with such pre- Islamic uses (see Q 4:98,\n6:97, or 16:16).3 It is nonetheless doubtful w hether the core Qur’anic meta phor of divine\nguidance may simply be credited to “the Arab experience of living in the desert” (Durie\n2018, 126). Rather, it is tangibly continuous with a prominent Biblical theme, in so far as the\nQur’anic employment of hadā maps onto Hebrew nāḥâ, Syriac dbar, and Greek hodēgeō\n(TDOT 9:311–318; TDNT 5:42–114). This continuity is exemplified by Ps 5:9 (briefly noted\nin Sperl 1994, 220): “O Lord, guide me (nḥēnî, Peshitta: dbarayn, Septuagint: hodēgēson\nme) in your right eousness because of my enemies; make your way straight before me.”\nBiblical recourse to the notion of guidance may be further illustrated by Exod 15:13 (“In\nyour steadfast love you guided the people whom you redeemed”), Ps 77:21 (“You guided\nyour people like a flock at the hand of Moses and Aaron”), and Isa 58:11 (“The Lord w ill\n1 Van Putten 2017 argues that the third- person singular verb hadā was pronounced hadē while the noun\nhudā without nunation was realised as hudē (see especially van Putten 2017, 63 and 70).\n2 For further verses, see Lyall 1918–1924, no. 44:4 = EAP 2:140; Lyall 1919, no. 15:6; Geyer 1892, no. 23:11;\nDSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 4:18.\n3 See n. 6 below.\nhadā 701", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Given that there had been Arabophone Christians for centuries before\nthe Qur’an, it is distinctly likely that a religious use of Arabic hadā predates the Islamic\nscripture.4 Unequivocal evidence for this hypothesis is admittedly lacking, but a Biblically\ninformed religious employment of h- d- y could be reflected by a verse from the dīwān of\nthe Christian ʿAdī ibn Zayd that states, in the context of describing how the Lakhmid\nking al-N uʿmān contemplated the ephemerality of his power, that “being guided entails\nthoughtful contemplation” (li- l- hudā tafkīr).5\nDivine guidance in the Qur’an. Although the scope of the pre sent entry does not per-\nmit a comprehensive review of the 268 Qur’anic verses containing derivatives of the root\nh- d- y, central aspects of the Qur’anic notion of divine guidance deserve comment. Two\npoints in par tic u lar stand out. First, h umans are inescapably reliant on God’s guidance\nif they are not to go astray: “Praise be to God who has guided us to this; we would not\nhave been guided had God not guided us” (al-ḥ amdu li- llāhi lladhī hadānā li- hādhā wa-\nmā kunnā li- nahtadiya law lā an hadānā llāhu), the blessed will say according to Q 7:43.\nSimilarly, when Abraham contemplates the rising and setting of vari ous heavenly bodies,\nculminating in his discovery that the only being deserving of worship is “the one who\ncreated the heavens and the earth” (Q 6:75–79, citing v. 79), this is described not as an\nautonomous exercise of Abraham’s innate intelligence but rather as an instance of divine\nguidance. As Abraham himself confesses in Q 6:77, “If my Lord does not guide me, I shall\nbe one of t hose who go astray” (see Lowin 2006, 123–124 and 128–132).\nSecondly, and corresponding with this inescapable human need for God’s guidance,\nthe Qur’an frequently underlines the objective and abundant availability of such guidance.\nWhen Adam is expelled from paradise, God announces to him, his mate, and their nem-\nesis the devil or Satan (→ al- shayṭān), “If [subsequently] guidance comes to youp from\nme, those who follow my guidance (fa-m an tabiʿa hudāya) will have nothing to be afraid\nof and will not know grief” (Q 2:38; see also 20:123). Such divine guidance takes the\nform of divine revelation but also of sundry manifestations or “signs” (singular: → āyah)\nof God’s power and benevolence in the natur al world (see also HCI 172–174). Thus, God\nhas arranged the earth in accordance with the needs of humans “so that they might be\nguided” (Q 21:31: laʿallahum yahtadūn; cf. 16:15 and 43:10);6 God gave “the scripture”\n4 A link between hadā and specifically Christian usage is already posited in CQ 42, although Ahrens fails to\nacknowledge the notion’s substantial pre ce dent in the Hebrew Bible.\n5 Al- Muʿaybid 1965, no. 16:27. The verse has variants, e.g., li- l- hudā tabṣīr and li- l- hudā tadhkīr. To be sure,\nit is not made explicit that the source of guidance is here envisaged to be God, but Andrae plausibly understands\nthis to be presupposed (Andrae 1926, 46). Th ere is also a poem attributed to Labīd that speaks of God guiding\nhumans “on the paths of the good” (man hadāhu subula l-k hayri htadā) and of his sovereign power to lead p eople\nastray (wa- man shāʾa aḍal [sic]; ʿAbbās 1962, no. 26:3). However, it is not certain that Labīd’s poem is really free\nfrom the impact of Qur’anic diction, even if Brockelmann is more confident (Brockelmann 1922, 115).\n6 Immediately before the metatextual clause laʿallahum yahtadūn / laʿallakum tahtadūn (“so that they/youp\nmay be guided”) that concludes Q 16:15, 21:31, and 43:10, all three verses state that God has provided humans\nwith pathways (subul) on the earth. Should one accordingly understand ihtadā to refer to literal orientation on\nthe surface of the earth h ere?

The same goes for Q 4:98, describing oppressed men, women, and children as “not being guided to any\nway” (wa-l ā yahtadūna sabīlā), which must be a meta phor for the impotence of their situation rather than for\nreligious deviance.

Hence, the Qur’an pre sents God’s guidance as freely\nand generously available to humans, as something that is writ large across both nature and\nhistory; it is no esoteric and rarified gnosis accessible only to a select few.\nTwo senses of “to guide” (hadā). While many Qur’anic verses suggest or presuppose\nthat h umans are in princi ple capable of understanding and accepting God’s guidance in its\nvari ous garbs, the Qur’an also bespeaks an acute awareness of the fact that many people\nreject what ever divine guidance they encounter (e.g., Q 7:193.198, 10:43, 27:81, 28:56).\nReflecting this, the Qur’an employs the verb “to guide” (hadā) in two slightly dif er ent\nsenses. On the one hand, the word can articulate that h umans in general, or some par tic-\nul ar h uman collective or individual, have been presented with God’s objective guidance in\nnature or revelation, which they may well fail to embrace. An example for this usage, which\none might call “pre sen ta tional,” is Q 41:17: “And as for Thamūd, we guided them, and they\npreferred blindness over guidance; and the thunderbolt of the degrading punishment took\nthem for what they had been accruing.”9 An impersonal equivalent of hadā in this first,\npre sen ta tional sense is the phrase “guidance (or the guidance) has come to youp/them”\n(jāʾakum/jāʾahum hudan/al- hudā; Q 6:157, 10:57, 17:94, 18:55, 34:32, 53:23), which can be\ncoupled with an explicit indication of God as the source of guidance, in the form of the\nprepositional complement “from yourp/their Lord” (min rabbikum/rabbihim; Q 6:157,\n10:57, 53:23).10 Secondly, and more frequently, “to guide” (hadā) is used as a success verb\nimplying an individual’s subjective ac cep tance of what ever objective guidance he or she\nmight encounter in the cosmos or in history (e.g., Q 93:7). Such subjective h uman assent\nto divine guidance can be reported very explic itly, as in Q 72:13: “when we listened to the\nguidance (samiʿnā l- hudā), we believed in it (āmannā bihi).” It can also be expressed by the\nreward (e.g., Q 3:123.130.132.200, 6:42.51.65.69 e tc.). Furthermore, all other occurrences specifically of laʿallakum\ntahtadūn / laʿallahum yahtadūn (Q 2:53.150, 3:103, 7:158, 23:49, 32:3) have a religious significance. It therefore\nstands to reason that Q 16:15, 21:31, and 43:10 too use ihtadā to evoke divine guidance. Still, Q 16:16 then goes\non to shift to what is clearly a secular sense of ihtadā: God has provided h umans with landmarks (ʿalāmāt), “and\nthey are guided by the stars” (wa- bi- l- najmi hum yahtadūn). Thus, Q 16:15, 21:31, and 43:10 seem to be deliberately\nplaying on the double sense of h- d- y. The same may be true for Q 20:10, according to which Moses hoped to find\n“guidance” at the fire he spotted in the distance. The narrative is best read as implying that Moses was seeking\nmundane guidance yet found divine one.\n7 On Moses’s receipt of “the scripture” and guidance, see also Q 2:53, 6:154, 17:2, 28:43, 32:23, 40:53–54.\n8 For other verses associating the Qur’an, the Torah (or “the book that Moses brought”), and the Gospel with\nthe provision of divine guidance (hudā), see Q 2:185, 5:44.46, 6:91, 46:30, 17:9, 27:92, and 41:44 (cf. also 7:52). The\nMosaic tablets are also said to convey divine guidance (Q 7:154). Th ere are further statements describing God’s\nrevelations, and specifically his revelations to Muhammad, as providing guidance (e.g., Q 10:57, 16:64.89.102, or\n27:1–2.76–77). A fuller survey is provided in Rahbar 1960, 95–96 and 365–371.\n9 For other verses that use hadā in this sense, see Q 76:3, 90:10, and prob ably also 87:3.\n10 Note that statements of the form “t here has come to youp / to them (jāʾakum/jāʾahum) . . .” also take\nmany other subjects than guidance, for instance, “a scripture” (kitāb; Q 2:89), “a messenger” (rasūl, e.g., Q 2:101),\n“reminding exhortation” (dhikrun; e.g., Q 7:63), “knowledge” (al-ʿ ilm; e.g., Q 3:19), or “the truth” (al-ḥ aqq; e.g.,\nQ 10:76). In such cases too we encounter a prepositional complement specifying God as the source, such as “from\nyourp Lord” (min rabbikum) or “from us” (min ʿindinā).\nhadā 703", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Although the latter’s literal meaning is “to\nbe guided” (e.g., Q 6:97), there are cases in which it is best rendered as “to allow o.s. to be\nguided,” as in the repeated affirmation that God “knows best those who allow themselves\nto be guided” (wa-h uwa aʿlamu bi-l -m uhtadīn; Q 6:117, 16:125, 28:56, 68:7; see already\nAhrens 1935, 84, pointing inter alia to Q 21:41).11\nThe theological counterfactual “had God willed” (law shāʾa llāhu) and the prob lem\nof predestination. As we saw e arlier, many humans reject God’s guidance. Some passages\nsuggest that this general state of afairs is divinely willed: “had God willed” (law shāʾa\nllāhu; see also u nder → shāʾa), he could have produced universal assent to his guidance\n(Q 6:35.149, 13:31, 16:9, all of which couple law shāʾa/yashāʾu ±​<allāhu> with the roots h-\nd- y and j- m-ʿ ; see also 10:99 and 32:13) or could have made humans “a single community”\n(→ ummatan wāḥidatan; Q 5:48, 11:118, 16:93, and 42:8).12 In the verses just referenced,\nthe theological counterfactual law shāʾa llāhu may simply be taken to convey the claim that\nGod has deliberately refrained from ensuring unfailing h uman conformity to his moral and\nreligious demands, which would have given rise to a world with no genuine ethico- religious\nchoices (Rahbar 1960, 80). Instead, one may go on to say, God has created a world in which\nhumans are being “tested” (→ balā, ibtalā) for their religious and moral decisions (e.g.,\nQ 21:35, 23:30, 47:31, 68:17, 76:2), as a result of which some will earn paradisiacal reward\nwhile others will incur eternal perdition.13 Such a reading steers clear of predestinarian-\nism, that is, of the claim that God has inscrutably assigned one lot of h umans to heaven\nand another one to hell, without delegating to them any control over their eschatological\noutcome. In other words, the view just sketched would permit one to evade the difficult\nand perennial question of how God could fairly reward and punish humans for actions\nover which they have no control.14\nYet predestinarianism or divine determinism seems more difficult to avoid for other\nQur’anic statements. For instance, Q 16:93 says: “Had God willed (wa- law shāʾa llāhu), he\nwould have made youp a single community; but he leads astray whom he wills (man yashāʾu)\nand guides whom he w ills” (cf. Q 42:8). In fact, the assertion that God “guides whom he\nwills” (yahdī man yashāʾu), just cited as part of Q 16:93, recurs multiple times throughout\nthe Qur’an (see, with occasional variants, Q 2:142.213.272, 6:88, 7:155, 10:25, 14:4, 16:93,\n24:35.46, 28:56, 35:8, 39:23, 42:52, 74:31; cf. also 6:39). Like in Q 16:93, it is often coupled\n11 For an occurrence of ihtadā in pre-I slamic poetry, see DSAAP, Ṭarafah, no. 13:9 (cf. Jacobi 1971, 36), where\nit is applied to the poet’s lover “letting herself be guided” by her amatory ties to the poet.\n12 For a comprehensive survey of the Qur’anic use of law shāʾa llāhu, refer to Rahbar 1960, 79–82 and\n344–346. Occurrences of law shāʾa ±​<llāhu/rabbuka/l- raḥmān> not listed in the main text are Q 2:20.220.253,\n4:90, 6:107.112.137.148, 10:16, 16:35, 23:24, 25:45, 41:14, 43:20.\n13 In Q 32:13, the divine voice declares that “had we willed, we would have provided every one with guidance;\nbut [instead] my word has come true, that I w ill fill hell with the jinn and h umans all together (wa- lākin ḥaqqa\nl- qawlu minnī la- amlaʾanna jahannama mina l- jinnati wa- l- nāsi ajmaʿīn)”; similar wording appears in Q 11:119.\nGiven that the Qur’an is clear that at least some individuals w ill make it to paradise, the word ajmaʿīn in t hese two\npassages simply cannot mean that God has resolved to consign all humans and jinn (whom the Qur’an considers\nto be moral subjects) to perdition. See also Rahbar 1960, 81.\n14 For a late antique manifestation of the Kantian intuition that “ ought implies can,” see Ephrem’s concise\nquestion against astral determinism, “If there is no freedom (ḥērūtā), then why is there reproach (marshūtā)?”\n(Beck 1957b, no. 5:8). Such considerations do not of course amount to a compelling refutation of theological\npredestinarianism. For example, a prominent strand of post- Qur’anic theology, the Ashʿarite school, is adamant\nthat God is simply not answerable to human conceptions of fairness (e.g., Frank 1983, 210–214).\n704 hadā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The same impression arises from Q 6:125, which highlights God’s\ninvolvement in the inner pro cess of a subject’s ac cep tance or rejection of divine guidance:\n“whom God wants to guide, he opens up his breast to self-s urrender (fa-m an yuridi llāhu\nan yahdiyahu yashraḥ ṣadrahu li- l- islāmi), and whom we wants to lead astray, he makes his\nbreast narrow and constricted” (cf. 39:22; → aslama).\nOn the other hand, a predestinarian reading of the Qur’an does render it puzzling\nwhy the Islamic scripture should be so concerned to highlight that God does not “inflict\nwrong on his servants” (e.g., Q 3:182: laysa bi- ẓallāmin li- l- ʿabīd; see under → ẓalama\nand → shāʾa), that he is the “best judge” (aḥkam al-ḥ ākimīn; Q 11:45, 95:8), or that he can\nplausibly and legitimately be asked to judge justly (Q 21:112: uḥkum bi-l -ḥ aqqi). There is,\nfurthermore, a considerable amount of evidence to the efect that the Qur’an does not in\nfact suppose the gift of divine guidance—u nderstood as that which disposes an individ-\nual towards subjective ac cep tance of what ever objective guidance he or she encounters\nin the world or in history—to be in de pen dent of h uman merit (Rahbar 1960, 67–85 and\n91–96). For one, the Qur’an frequently reiterates that God “does not guide the p eople\nwho are wrongdoers/repudiators/sinners” (lā yahdī l- qawma l- ẓālimīn/kāfirīn/fāsiqīn;\nQ 2:258.264, 3:86, 5:51.67.108, 6:144, 9:19.24.37.80.109, 16:107, 28:50, 46:10, 61:5.7, 62:5,\n63:6), and other verses make the same point that unbelief and moral vices disqualify some-\none from receiving divine guidance (e.g., Q 4:137.168, 39:3, 40:28; see Rahbar 1960, 91 and\n356–358). Tellingly, two verses vary the yahdī man yashāʾu formula by saying that “God\nleads astray whom he w ills and guides to himself who turns to him (wa- yahdī ilayhi man\nanāb)” (Q 13:27, similarly 42:13).16 The obvious implication is that those whom God wills\nto guide are t hose who deserve to be guided, by virtue of having turned to God. Elsewhere,\ntoo, the gift of divine guidance or increase in such guidance are made consequent upon\nprior belief (e.g., Q 2:213, 4:175, 18:13, 64:11; see the conspectus in Rahbar 1960, 92–93 and\n360–362, and below). The fact that God is in princi ple sovereign in deciding whom he will\nand w ill not guide does not mean that he w ill in fact withhold his guidance from t hose\ndeserving it, or irresistibly thrust it upon those who have hitherto shown themselves to be\nrecalcitrant to God’s signs. As noted elsewhere, the Qur’anic understanding of how divine\nomnipotence intersects with human agency crucially hinges on the domain of the poten-\ntial and counterfactual rather than on what God does in actual fact (see under → shāʾa).\nGod “increases in guidance” those who allow themselves to be guided. According\nto Daud Rahbar, the Qur’an’s “consistent position” is that “whoever shows willingness\nto be guided, God increases him in guidance; and whoever defies God stubbornly, God\ncondemns him as hopeless and increases him in error” (Rahbar 1960, 82). The quotation\nillustrates the theological importance of the notion of divinely granted “increase” (verb:\nzāda) of belief or unbelief. For instance, regarding those “in whose heart is sickness”\n15 Cf. Rom 9:17–18: God “has mercy on whomsoever he chooses (hon thelei; Peshitta: man d-ṣ ābē)” and\n“hardens whomsoever he chooses” (Boyd 1923, 154; Thyen 1989, 212–213; Reynolds 2020, 195–196).\n16 On the meaning of anāba, see CDKA 276.\nhadā 705", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

The term muhaymin occurs twice in the Qur’an, in the Medinan verses Q 5:48\nand 59:23. In the latter case, the word figures in a string of divine epithets (→ ism), which\ninter alia call God al- muʾmin al- muhaymin. Muʾmin must mean “granter of security here”\n(cf. especially the meaning of → āmana in Q 106:4). Muhaymin, meanwhile, is derived\nfrom Syriac mhaymnā (or conceivably from its equivalent in some other form of Aramaic),\na passive participle of the verb haymen and meaning “trustworthy, faithful, loyal” (NB\n27; FVQ 273–274; cf. SL 719–720; see also DJBA 644). Al- muʾmin al- muhaymin therefore\ndescribes God as the “trustworthy granter of security.” Horovitz notes that the statement\nthat YHWH is a “faithful God” (hāʾēl hanneʾĕmān) at Deut 7:9 is rendered allāhā mhaymnā\nin the Peshitta. In view of this direct precursor, t here is a strong case for reading the con-\nsonantal ductus m- h- y- m- n as the passive muhayman (JPND 225–226), which is attested as\na variant reading for Q 5:48 (MQ 2:285; MQQ 2:215). A hy po thet i cal shift from al- muʾmin\nal- muhayman to al- muʾmin al- muhaymin could be readily accounted for in euphonic terms.1\nAs a divine epithet, muhaymin is also found in a brief rajaz poem attributed to Umayyah\nibn Abī l- Ṣalt (Schulthess 1911a, no. 25:29 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 10:29; see Seidensticker 2011b,\n47–49).2\nIn Q 5:48.

It is\nnot unreasonable to conjecture that muhaymin might simply be an approximate equiva-\nlent of muṣaddiq here. Such a pleonastic understanding is already part of the early Islamic\nexegetical rec ord (see Ṭab. 8:489–490) and has also found favour among Western scholars\n(NB 27; JPND 225; KK 122–123). However, considering that in Q 5:48 muhaymin or mu-\nhayman takes the preposition ʿalā, rather than li-, as the preceding term muṣaddiq, it is\nalso pos si ble that muhaymin/muhayman implies the stronger claim that the Qur’an does\n1 After raising the pertinence of a passive reading, Horovitz nonetheless dismisses it b ecause of the neigh-\nbouring al- muʾmin. His rationale would seem to be that a succession of two active participles with similar roots\nis more likely than an active one followed by a passive one. However, this is precisely why a textual development\n* al- muʾmin al- muhayman > al- muʾmin al- muhaymin is easily imaginable. On the other hand, t here is no com-\npelling reason either to rule out that the Arabised version of the divine epithet mhaymnā was assimilated to the\nimmediately preceding word muʾmin already when the verse was proclaimed for the very first time.\n2 For another occurrence, less likely to be aut hen tic, see Schulthess 1911a, no. 24:3 = al- Saṭlī 1974, no. 74:3,\nwhich combines muhaymin and qayyūm.

The noun ʿahd— whose consonantal root ʿ- h- d (on which\nsee CDKA 196) also underlies the verbs ʿahida ilā, “to impose an obligation on s.o.” (e.g.,\nQ 2:125, 20:115),1 and ʿāhada + acc., “to conclude an agreement, contract, treaty, or cove-\nnant with s.o.” (e.g., Q 2:177)2—is attested already in the early Meccan verse Q 70:32 and\n1 By contrast, Q 7:134 and 43:49 have ʿahida ʿinda, “to enter into an agreement, contract, treaty, or covenant\nwith s.o.” As Ambros remarks (CDKA 196), the formulation could also be construed as transitive (“to enter into\nan agreement or covenant with s.o. to do s.th.”).\n2 Q 2:100 has ʿāhadū ʿahdan, “they concluded an agreement, contract, treaty, or covenant.” As Ambros\nexplains (CDKA 196), ʿahdan could either be a direct object or a mafʿūl muṭlaq.\n709", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Both laud those who “re spect goods entrusted to them\nand agreements made by them” (wa- lladhīna hum li- amānātihim wa- ʿahdihim rāʿūn) and\naccordingly apply the word ʿahd to contracts or compacts between two human parties.\nThis interhuman employment recurs in Q 17:34, admonishing the addressees to fulfil con-\ntracts or agreements (wa- awfū bi- l-ʿ ahdi inna l-ʿ ahda kāna masʾūlā). But Meccan surahs\nalso exhibit a theological employment of ʿahd to refer to an agreement or covenant be-\ntween God and h umans, as shown by appeals to fulfil (awfā bi-) or not to violate (naqaḍa)\n“the covenant with God” (ʿahd allāh) in Q 6:152, 13:20.25 and 16:91, or not to “sell the\ncovenant with God for a small price” in Q 16:95 (wa- lā tashtarū bi-ʿ ahdi llāhi thamanan\nqalīlan; → sharā).3 This theological usage of the word ʿahd persists in the Medinan Qur’an,\nas illustrated by Q 2:27, threatening “t hose who violate God’s covenant a fter concluding\nit” (alladhīna yanquḍūna ʿahda llāhi min baʿdi mīthāqihi; see below), or 2:40, where the\ndivine voice urges the Israelites (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl) to “fulfil the covenant with me, and I s hall\nfulfil the covenant with you” (wa- awfū bi-ʿ ahdī ūfi bi-ʿ ahdikum).\nThe meaning of ʿahd overlaps with that of mīthāq, which is likewise found already in\nMeccan surahs (Q 13:20.25, perhaps also 7:169), though less frequently than in Medinan\nones. As Q 5:7 shows (wa-d hkurū niʿmata llāhi ʿalaykum wa-m īthāqahu lladhī wāthaqakum\nbihi), a mīthāq is the means or product of the activity described by the verb wāthaqa + acc.,\n“to conclude a treaty or covenant with s.o.”: “And remember God’s grace upon youp and\nthe covenant he has concluded with you.” The close semantic relationship between ʿahd\nand mīthāq is illustrated by the phrase alladhīna yanquḍūna ʿahda llāhi min baʿdi mīthāqihi\n(“t hose who break God’s ʿahd a fter its mīthāq”), initially found in the Meccan verse Q 13:25\nand subsequently reprised in the Medinan one 2:27. Here, ʿahd would seem to refer to a\ncovenant in the abstract, qua a set of obligations to be kept, while mīthāq denotes the act\nof entering into such a covenant. By contrast, in Q 13:20 (alladhīna yūfūna bi- ʿahdi llāhi\nwa- lā yanquḍūna l- mīthāq, “t hose who fulfil God’s ʿahd and do not violate the mīthāq”) the\ntwo words figure in an essentially synonymous capacity. One infers that mīthāq can mean,\nfirst, a contract, treaty, or covenant and, secondly, the action of concluding it (thus also\nCDKA 283–284). Like the word ʿahd, mīthāq can apply to treaties or covenants between\nhuman parties (Q 4:21.90.92, 8:72).\nKey aspects of divine-h uman covenants in the Qur’an. Q 2:40, cited e arlier, enun-\nciates that human covenants with God are reciprocal: “fulfil the covenant with me, and I\nshall fulfil the covenant with you” (wa- awfū bi-ʿ ahdī ūfi bi-ʿ ahdikum).4 What this means is\nthat humans are bidden to re spect certain behavioural and/or doctrinal norms, in return\nfor which God will grant them a set reward. Thus, the Medinan verse Q 48:10 promises,\napropos of the believers’ pledge of allegiance to the Qur’anic Messenger, that “anyone\nwho fulfils what he has covenanted to do vis-à - vis God (wa- man awfā bi- mā ʿāhada ʿa-\nlayhu llāha) will receive a great wage (→ ajr).” Conversely, Q 9:75 mentions those who\nhave “covenanted with God (man ʿāhada llāha), ‘If he grants us some of his favour, we\nshall make gifts of charity and be righ teous (la-n aṣṣaddaqanna wa-la nakūnanna mina\n3 For other Meccan verses in which ʿahd plays a theological role, see Q 19:78.87 (and perhaps also 20:86).\nOn awfā, see Leemhuis 1977, 55, 75–76.\n4 See also Buhl 1924b, 101 (who maintains that some Qur’anic verses show a unilateral rather than recip-\nrocal employment of ʿ- h- d), and the corrective remarks by Rudi Paret in KK 172 and 196 (on Q 7:134 f. and 9:7).\n710 wāthaqa", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

If, however, the latter fails to\nmaterialise (Q 9:76), divine punishment w ill ensue (Q 9:77–78). Divine-h uman covenants\nor contracts thus revolve around a responsive nexus between human righ teousness in the\npre sent world and divine requital in the hereafter.\nThe reciprocity of obligation implied by divine-h uman covenants ties in with the Qur’an’s\nfrequent assertions that God will “pay in full” (waffā) the wages that humans deserve\n(Q 3:57, 4:173: fa- yuwaffīhim ujūrahum; see in more detail u nder → ajr). The link that the\nQur’an establishes between the meta phor of a divine- human covenant and commercial\nnotions such as buying and selling is particularly explicit in Q 9:111. The passage, which is\nagain Medinan, affirms that “God has purchased from the believers their lives and their pos-\nsessions in exchange for the garden being theirs: they fight on God’s path (→ sabīl), killing\nand being killed, by way of a promise that is binding on him in the Torah (→ al- tawrāh),\nthe Gospel (→ al- injīl), and the Qur’anic recitations (al- qurʾān; → qaraʾa).” The verse then\ngoes on to pose the rhetorical question, “Who fulfils covenants more sincerely than God\n(wa-m an awfā bi-ʿ ahdihi mina llāhi)?” It is arguable, therefore, that in the Qur’an a covenant\nbetween God and h umans bears greater similarity to a commercial contract than to the\nancient Near Eastern suzerainty treaties that formed the template for Biblical conceptions\nof God’s covenant with the Israelites (TDOT 2:267–269; NIDOTTE 1:747–748). The quasi-\ncommercial nature of divine-h uman covenants in the Qur’an is particularly manifest in so far\nas they are to a significant degree predicated, e ither explic itly or implicitly, on an entailment\nbetween individual merit and individual reward. As illustrated by Q 9:111, the rewards or\npunishments in question are first and foremost eschatological (cf. Q 2:85 and 13:20–25), even\nif a group’s repeated transgression of their covenant with God may also have this-w orldly\nconsequences for the respective collective as a w hole: the Israelites w ere burdened with\nonerous prohibitions (Q 4:160–161), while the Christians w ere afflicted with enmity and\nhatred (Q 5:14). Still, in view of the eschatological dimension at play, it appears that even\nwhen God enters into a covenant with a h uman collective like the Israelites (e.g., Q 2:83)\nor the Christians (Q 5:14), the contract at hand is ultimately one with h uman individuals,\nwho w ill be eschatologically punished or rewarded according to their personal track rec ord\nrather than being accountable for the corporate track rec ord (Firestone 2011, 409–410). As\nGod informs Abraham, “My covenant does not extend to t hose who do wrong” (Q 2:124: lā\nyanālu ʿahdī l-ẓ ālimīn), thereby rejecting Abraham’s supplication on behalf of the entirety\nof his descendants and insisting on the crucial importance of individual right eousness (cf.\nalso Q 37:113 and see Sinai 2009, 139–142).\nNotwithstanding the mutuality of divine covenants with h umans, it is God as the superior\nparty of the compact who must initiate them. This is thrown into relief by the substantial\nnumber of Medinan verses employing the phrase akhadha X mīthāqa Y (Q 2:63.83.84.93,\n3:81.187, 5:12.14.70, 57:8) or, equivalently, akhadha X mīthāqan min Y (Q 4:21.154, 33:7),\nwhere X is God and Y some human party, such as the ancient Israelites (cf. also Q 7:169;\nsee Firestone 2011, 405). At least in some cases, the force of akhadha X mīthāqa Y is not\nadequately expressed by “X concluded a covenant with Y,” since this could suggest an\nagreement that is fundamentally voluntary and uncoerced. This, however, is clearly not\nthe case in Q 2:63.93 and 4:154, where God dictates his covenantal terms to the Israelites\nby menacingly raising Mount Sinai over their heads (WMJA 161; BEQ 303–304; Obermann\nwāthaqa 711", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

In view of this, it is preferable to render akhadha\nX mīthāqa Y along the lines of “X took a covenantal pledge from Y” or “X imposed a cov-\nenant on Y.”\nConcrete groups with whom God is said to have concluded a covenant (mīthāq) include\nthe Israelites (see Q 2:63.83.84.93, 5:12–13, 5:70), who also figure under the more general\numbrella term “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al-k itāb; see Q 4:153–155 and cf. 3:187), the\nChristians (→ al- naṣārā; Q 5:14), “the prophets” (Q 3:81, 33:7), and the Qur’anic commu-\nnity (Q 5:7, 57:8).5 Some of these passages give details about the contents of the covenant\nin question. Thus, according to a passage reminiscent of the Biblical Decalogue, the Is-\nraelites were required not to worship anyone but God, to treat their parents and vari ous\nsocially marginalised groups kindly, to pray, to give alms, not to shed blood, and not to\nexpel one another from their dwellings (Q 2:83–84). A partially overlapping list of Isra-\nelite covenantal obligations, including prayer and alms giving as well as believing in and\naiding God’s messengers, is found in Q 5:12. At least some of t hese expectations, such as\nthe injunction to serve God alone (Q 2:83), are unmistakably norms by which the Qur’an\nconsiders all humans to be bound anyway: at least to a degree, then, the imposition of a\ncovenant on the Israelites only explicates certain pre- existing and universal religious and\nmoral expectations on the part of the deity. More specific to one par tic u lar subgroup of\nhumans but still imbued by a universal horizon is Q 3:187, which says that “ those who w ere\ngiven the scripture,” who may be the Israelites here, were obliged to “make” the scripture\n“clear” (→ bayyana) “to people” (li- l- nāsi) and not to “conceal” (katama; see under → ˻ahl\nal- kitāb) it. This would seem to task the Israelites with kerygmatic outreach t owards the\nrest of humanity. Outright accusations of covenant- breaking (naqḍ) tend to be reserved\nfor the Israelites (Q 5:12–13) or the Jews (Q 4:155–161),6 even if they can figure under the\nmore general umbrella term “scripture- owners” in this context (Q 4:155).7 With regard to\nthe Christians, the Qur’an employs only the somewhat milder accusation that they “forgot\npart of what they had been reminded of” (Q 5:14: fa- nasū ḥaẓẓan mimmā dhukkirū bihi),\na phrase that the previous verse, Q 5:13, already applied to the Israelites (cf. also Q 6:44,\n7:165, 18:57; see generally u nder → nasiya). As regards the prophets, they are said to have\nbeen covenantally obliged to believe in and aid subsequent divine messengers confirming\nthem (Q 3:81). This is prob ably an indirect manner of insisting that the followers of such\nearlier prophets are expected to do likewise (cf. Q 5:12), entailing specifically an obligation\nto acknowledge Muhammad.\nAn impor tant aspect of the Qur’anic understanding of divine- human covenants, there-\nfore, revolves around the failure of the Jews and Christians to live up to their covenantal\nobligations, obligations that the Medinan community of Qur’anic believers is now called\nupon to honour in a more successful manner (Q 5:7, 57:8). In Q 5:7, the contrast with\nthe unreliability of the Israelites in par tic u lar is strongly foregrounded by the Qur’an’s\n5 Depending on how one construes the pronouns in Q 57:8, the latter verse might also be read as saying that\nit is the Qur’anic Messenger who, acting as God’s representative, imposes a covenant on the believers (wa- qad\nakhadha mīthāqakum).\n6 Q 4:160 has alladhīna hādū.\n7 For generic condemnations of breaking covenants with God, see Q 2:27 (though this is a prelude to the\nextensive litany of Israelite transgressions that follows in vv. 40 f.) and 13:20.25. For other descriptions of Israelite\ninfractions of their covenant with God that do not use the verb naqaḍa or its corresponding verbal noun, see\nQ 2:85.93, 3:187, and 5:70.

The\nutterance forms a marked contrast with the Israelites’ alleged response samiʿnā wa-ʿ aṣaynā,\n“we hear and disobey,” upon being charged with God’s covenant (Q 2:93; see in more\ndetail under → samiʿa). While the Qur’an’s perspective h ere is patently supersessionist,\nthe Islamic scripture nonetheless displays an unmistakable propensity to universalise the\nBiblical notion of covenant. This is manifest not only in the mostly universal content of\nthe covenantal obligations imposed by God, as seen e arlier, but comes to the fore with\npar tic u lar clarity in two passages that depict a divine covenant with all of humankind\nrather than with a restricted subset thereof: Q 33:72 and 7:172–173, to be discussed in the\nfinal paragraphs of this entry.\nGod’s universal covenant with all of humankind. Q 33:72, which is compositionally\nprominent due to being part of the surah’s final two verses (together with v. 73), has the\ndivine voice aver that “we ofered the trust (innā ʿaraḍnā l- amānata) to the heavens, the\nearth, and the mountains, and they declined to carry it and were afraid of it; and man has\ncarried it. [Yet] he is guilty of wrongdoing and ignorance.” Although the verse employs the\nterm amānah (“trust, entrusted good”; cf. Q 2:283, 4:58, 8:27, 23:8, 70:32) rather than one\nof the two common Qur’anic words for “covenant,” ʿahd or mīthāq, the passage does read\nlike a covenanting scene in which humans, contrasting with the most imposing entities in\nnature, fearlessly—a nd perhaps over-a mbitiously— consent to bearing the burden of moral\nresponsibility, a burden that entails both an ultimate reckoning and the prospect of eternal\nbliss in paradise. This understanding is also supported by the fact that the word amānah is\nat least twice found in close proximity to ʿahd (Q 23:8, 70:32), allowing it to function as a\npartial synonym of the latter. Hence, the message of Q 33:72 would seem to be that the fact\nthat pre- eschatological humans are subject to constant divine testing (see u nder → balā)\nof their moral and religious probity is a state of afairs to which t hese human agents can\nand ought to regard themselves as having given primordial consent.\nThe scene alluded to in Q 33:72 bears a certain resemblance with Sifre Deuteronomy,\nno. 343 (Hammer 1986, 352–353). This rabbinic parallel recounts how God, before giving\nthe Torah to the p eople of Israel, undertook a whistle-s top tour of “all the nations,” includ-\ning the c hildren of Esau, the Ammonites, the Moabites, and the Ishmaelites, in order to\nofer the Torah to them. However, all of them declined upon being apprised of the vario us\nprohibitions contained therein. Only the people of Israel, the tradition holds, accepted\nthe Torah “with all its explanations and details.” Like Q 33:72, the eventual recipients of\nGod’s covenant are h ere placed in a more universal context of refuseniks, the diference\nbeing that the Qur’an casts the recipients of God’s covenant as humankind in general, as a\nresult of which the refuseniks that provide the contrastive foil must be non- human beings\nrather than other human communities.\nA second universalising treatment of divine- human covenants is found in Q 7:172–173,\nwhere God elicits from the future descendants of the “ children of Adam” a prenatal con-\nfession that God is their Lord (see in more detail under → rabb). As Dirk Hartwig has\ncompellingly argued (Hartwig 2008), this scene contrasts with the immediately preceding\nretelling of God’s covenant with the Israelites in Q 7:171: the Mosaic covenant is, as it were,\ncut down to size, not by being superseded, along Christian lines, but rather by being placed\nagainst the background of an even e arlier and more universal pact that God has concluded\nwith all humans who will ever tread the earth.

As emphasised already by Izutsu, the\nQur’anic meaning of the root w- ḥ-y may be illuminated by a number of prooftexts in\nearly Arabic poetry. The most in ter est ing one occurs in a poem from the dīwān of ʿAlqa-\nmah, where a male ostrich who is conversing with his wife after a long absence is said to\nbe “conveying something to her” (yūḥī ilayhā) by uttering sounds unintelligible to the\npoetic narrator (DSAAP, ʿAlqamah, no. 13:26; GMK 158–159 and Loynes 2021, 68–69).\nOther poems compare the half- obliterated traces of deserted camp sites to mysterious\nwriting (waḥy, plural: wuḥiyy), charged with meaning yet nonetheless undecipherable to\nan illiterate observer (ʿAbbās 1962, no. 51:2, discussed in GMK 159–160; see also DSAAP,\nZuhayr, no. 15:5; cf. the overview in Loynes 2021, 63–68). Izutsu infers that the noun waḥy\nand the verb awḥā refer to communication that is “accompanied by a sense of secrecy\nand mysteriousness” (GMK 153; see also GMK 158, 160). One manner in which this might\nbe further refined is by saying that the root w- ḥ-y characterises acts of communication\nthat do not involve the utterance of ordinary and readily transparent human speech, be\nit because the message transmitted is encoded in animal sounds or b ecause it is encoded\nin writing. The prime Qur’anic example supporting this position would be Q 19:11, also\ncited by Izutsu, where the dumbstruck Zechariah “conveys” to his p eople, presumably by\ngesticulating, that they are to “glorify God in the morning and in the even ing” (Q 19:11:\nfa- awḥā ilayhim an sabbiḥū bukratan wa-ʿ ashiyyā; see GMK 161 and Loynes 2021, 73–74).\nEvidently, Zechariah too is unable to rely on ordinary human speech.\n714 wathan", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

More convincing, perhaps, is the supposition\nthat the use of awḥā is here predicated on the assumption that the “dev ils” stand in a re-\nlationship of close intimacy to one another (however much they are contributing to one\nanother’s religious and moral downfall). Such an understanding would be able to appeal to\nother Qur’anic passages that depict intimate conversations (n- j- w) as a locus of opposition\nagainst the Messenger (e.g., Q 58:7–10). It may be suggested, therefore, that the semantic\nstress of the root w-ḥ - y is not so much on the opaqueness of the communicative medium\nas such but rather on the fact that the communicative event in question is not readily\ndecipherable or, indeed, interceptable by outside observers who are not the intended\nrecipients. The core meaning of waḥy and awḥā, then, would be intimate, esoteric, or\nencrypted communication, a point also made by Simon Loynes (Loynes 2021, 63–88,\nequating w-ḥ - y with “esoteric communication”). This would explain very well why, as we\nshall presently see, the Qur’an frequently applies the root to acts of divine inspiration and\nrevelation. Moreover, in favour of the suggestion that the basic sense of w-ḥ - y is intimate\nand esoteric communication, by what ever means, one may note that the verse by ʿAlqa-\nmah explic itly compares the male ostrich’s conversation with his wife to the “gibberish”\n(verb: tarāṭana) of “the Romans” (al- rūm). The interaction between the two birds is thus\nlikened to human speech, albeit in a language that is as incomprehensible to the poet as\nanimal sounds. Accordingly, the verse’s point is not so much that ostriches communi-\ncate in a manner that is categorically dif er ent from h uman language but rather that they\ncommunicate in a language that is meaningless to the poet even though it patently does\ncarry meaning for the communicating parties— just as writing clearly does carry meaning\neven if the poet is unable to decipher it. All of this supports the contention that the root\nw- ḥ-y relates to acts of communication that are encrypted in such a way as to exclude\neavesdropping bystanders.2\nW-ḥ - y and divine revelation. The Qur’anic employment of the root w-ḥ - y difers from\nthe poetic prooftexts referenced above in so far as the sender or originator of the act of\ncommunication in question is usually God rather than another h uman. Sometimes awḥā\ndescribes how God governs the behaviour of non- human animals or entities: according\nto Q 16:68, God “conveys to the bees that they are to make homes on mountains, in trees,\nand in buildings” (wa- awḥā rabbuka ilā l- naḥli ani ttakhidhī mina l- jibāli buyūtan wa- mina\n1 For another case of w-ḥ - y communication between “the dev ils,” though without an express reference to\nspoken language (q- w- l), see Q 6:121, where awḥā is perhaps best rendered as “to prompt,” as in 99:5 (see below):\nthe believers are warned that “the dev ils prompt their allies to dispute with youp (wa- inna l- shayāṭīna la- yūḥūna\nilā awliyāʾihim li- yujādilūkum); and if youp obey them, you w ill indeed be associators.” It is pos si ble that this\nrefers to an inward incitation to evil by malevolent demons (→ jinn, → shayṭān) rather than to communication\nbetween humans.\n2 The obvious way in which to apply this understanding to Q 19:11, cited above, would be to say that Zecha-\nriah’s gestures w ill naturally have been situationally geared to his addressees, who w ere of course familiar to him.\nawḥā 715", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Similarly,\nMoses is prompted to cast down his rod (Q 7:117: wa- awḥaynā ilā mūsā an alqi ʿaṣāka),\nwhose subsequent transformation into a snake then constitutes one of his confirmatory\nmiracles vis-à - vis Phar aoh, while Noah is instructed by God to build the ark “ under our\neyes and as conveyed by us” (Q 11:37 and 23:27: iṣnaʿi l-f ulka bi-a ʿyuninā wa- waḥyinā).\nThere are further instances in which awḥā refers to a divine prompt suggesting a specific\ncourse of action or to divine advice pertaining to a certain situation (see Q 7:160, 10:87,\n11:36, 12:15, 20:77, 26:52.63), and the recipients of such situation- specific divine inspi-\nration are by no means only prophetic figures like Moses but also include Moses’s m other\n(Q 20:38–39, 28:7). In one case, divine prompting is addressed to the angels (al- malāʾikah;\nQ 8:12), who are told to fortify the believers in b attle, and in another case it is addressed\nto the earth (al- arḍ), who will, on the day of judgement, quake, bring forth the dead, and\n“tell her tidings” (Q 99:1–4) “ because yourS Lord prompted it to do so” (Q 99:5: bi- anna\nrabbaka awḥā lahā).\nMost impor tant in the Qur’an, however, are arguably t hose cases in which God conveys\nto a human addressee not just a certain course of action but rather a message to be passed\non to a wider audience (cf. GMK 179). That God’s conveying of some communicative\ncontent to an individual human may be an intermediary step in reaching out to a wider\ngroup of recipients is very clear, for example, at Q 10:2, where the divine voice poses the\nrhetorical question why “the people” are astonished that “we conveyed to a man from\namong them that he should warn the people and give glad tidings to the believers” (an\nawḥaynā ilā rajulin minhum an andhiri l- nāsa wa- bashshiri lladhīna āmanū). Similarly,\nin Q 6:19 the Qur’anic messenger is bidden to declare, “This recitation was conveyed to\nme so that I might warn youp with it” (ūḥiya ilayya hādhā l-q urʾānu li- undhirakum bihi).\nThere are, accordingly, many Qur’anic verses in which awḥā functions as a general term\nfor the transmission of divine revelation to humans. This makes awḥā an approximate\nequivalent of → nazzala and anzala, “to send down,” although the two terms have distinct\nconnotations: awḥā highlights the privacy and intimacy of revelatory communication\nprior to the public dissemination of God’s message at the hand of Muhammad and his\npre de ces sors, while the spatial imagery inherent in nazzala and anzala emphasises that\nrevelation involves a transition from the divine to the human domain. In any case, even\nin instances in which awḥā might defensibly be rendered as “to reveal,” it remains en-\ntirely appropriate to translate the verb as “to convey” or—if used intransitively—as “to\nconvey revelations.” For instance, in Q 3:44, punctuating a narrative about Mary, the\ndivine voice affirms, “This belongs to the tidings of the hidden that we convey to youS”\n(dhālika min anbāʾi l- ghaybi nūḥīhi ilayka; see similarly 11:49 and 12:102),3 and Q 4:163\naddresses the Qur’anic Messenger by saying, “We have conveyed revelations to youS (innā\nawḥaynā ilayka) as we conveyed revelations (awḥaynā) to Noah and to the prophets after\n3 Q 11:49 is briefly discussed under → ˻asāṭīr al- awwalīn.\n716 awḥā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Like some scholars before him, Zahniser\nemphasises the verb’s connotation of completion and fullness, and at one point suggests the\nrendering “to take or complete someone in death” (Zahniser 1989, 18). However, as Zahniser\ngoes on to note, t here are several passages in which tawaffā designates a life that has, from\nthe viewpoint of ordinary h uman expectations, been prematurely cut short (e.g., Q 13:40,\n22:5, 40:67; see Zahniser 1989, 20–21). He reconciles the two considerations by observing\nthat “when a person’s life is taken by God or His angels in death, it is a complete life, even\nif, when mea sured by the usual span of h uman life, it is short” (Zahniser 1989, 23).

The eighth-f orm verb ittaqā + acc. refers to guarding or pro-\ntecting oneself against some danger or harm (AEL 3059; see also al-F arāhī 2002, 253–258).\nThe verb’s basic sense emerges very clearly from one of the poetic prooftexts cited by Izutsu\n(GMK 235–236), taken from the Muʿallaqah of ʿAntarah: the poets’ comrades “seek protec-\ntion against the [enemies’] spears by me” (yattaqūna biya l-a sinnatah; DSAAP, ʿAntarah,\nno. 21:71), meaning that the poet acts as a shield between his friends and their foes. This\ngeneral significance of ittaqā is morphologically expected, given the reflexive or medial\nsense that is often expressed by the eighth verbal form (Wright 1974, 1:42): the first- form\nverb waqā + acc. + acc. is “to protect or guard someone against s.th.” (e.g., Q 16:81), while\nittaqā + acc. is “to protect oneself against s.th.”\nA particularly striking illustration of the relationship between waqā and ittaqā is pro-\nvided by Q 2:24 in comparison with 66:6.

The parallel thus demonstrates the basic\nequivalence between ittaqā and waqā nafsahu.\nAnother Qur’anic occurrence that sheds valuable light on the semantics of ittaqā is\nQ 39:24, referring to the one who, on the day of resurrection, “seeks protection against the\nevil punishment by means of his face” (man yattaqī bi- wajhihi sūʾa l- ʿadhābi). Here, ittaqā\nbehaves similarly to the introductory quotation from ʿAntarah, since it takes a prepositional\nobject introduced by bi-, referring to some instrument by means of which one attempts\nto fend of a danger, and also a direct objective in the accusative, referring to the menace\nagainst which one seeks protection: whereas ʿAntarah’s companions are shielded from\ndanger by their heroic companion, in the Qur’an the sinner destined for hell has no other\nshield left than his own face (GMK 236–237).\nOverview of Qur’anic usage. In the Qur’an, that which people are bidden to guard\nthemselves against or to be wary of (ittaqā) is most often God (e.g., Q 2:189.194.196 e tc.,\n26:108.110.126 etc., 65:1.2.4.5 etc., 71:3), less frequently the fire of hell (al- nār) or the day\nof God’s eschatological reckoning (e.g., Q 3:131, 73:17). What one might call inner- worldly\nobjects of wariness, such as other h umans, are almost completely absent.1 Both Meccan\nand Medinan verses sometimes employ ittaqā without an explicit accusative object (e.g.,\nQ 2:21, 5:65, 6:155, 7:96, 92:5), but it is contextually appropriate to suppose that here, too,\nwhat is intended is guarding oneself against God or his eschatological punishment. This\nstance, designated by the noun taqwā, forms a core Qur’anic virtue, which is indicated by\nthe fact that the term al- muttaqūn— i.e., “t hose who guard themselves” against God, or,\nmore conventionally, “the God- fearing” (see below)— from early on serves as a collective\nlabel for those who merit paradise (e.g., Q 51:15, 52:17, 54:54, 68:34, 77:41, 78:31) and who\nare heedful of the Qur’anic proclamations (e.g., Q 69:48).\nAs Izutsu observes, guarding oneself against God involves emotions of concrete fear and\ndread, seeing that verbs meaning “to fear, to be afraid,” like khashiya and khāfa, often seem\nto function as approximate synonyms of ittaqā (ERCQ 195–200; Ohlander 2005, 141–145;\nsee also Sinai 2017a, 228). For instance, Q 24:52 promises eschatological reward to those\nwho obey God and his Messenger and who “are afraid of God and guard themselves against\nhim” (wa- yakhsha llāha wa- yattaqhi), while Q 31:33 calls the people to “guard yourselves\nagainst your Lord (ittaqū rabbakum) and fear a day (wa-k hshaw yawman) on which no\nfather will be able to give satisfaction on behalf of his child nor any child on behalf of his\nfather.” The intimate link between taqwā and fear is also obvious in Q 39:16, which after\nalluding to the hell- fire that will engulf the damned continues: “That is what God em-\nploys to frighten his servants (dhālika yukhawwifu llāhu bihi ʿibādahu) [thereby warning\n1 Unusually, Q 3:28 speaks of the believers protecting or guarding themselves against the unbelievers: the\nbelievers are not to take the unbelievers as allies over other believers, “ unless youp are protecting yourselves\nagainst a fear occasioned by them” or perhaps “against a danger emanating from them” (illā an tattaqū minhum\ntuqātan; cf. awajasa khīfatan min X in Q 11:70 and 51:28: “to feel fear against X”). It is int er est ing that even here\nthe unbelievers do not figure as the direct object of the believers’ wariness. The reason may be that believers are\nof course meant to be exclusively wary of God.\n720 ittaqā", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

Hence,\ntaqwā has a distinct behavioural content and is not reducible to a mere inward state.4 In\nview of this, the quality designated by taqwā, the verbal noun corresponding to ittaqā,\nis best defined as an attitude of fearful wariness of God as the eschatological judge (see\ngenerally Andrae 1926, 84–93, and Andrae 1932, 49, 60–61), a habitus of scrupulously\nguarding oneself against the danger of damnation by avoiding sin and worship of false\ndeities. God- wary conduct, it must be added, also encompasses positive acts like prayer\n(→ ṣallā) and almsgiving (→ zakāh). This is shown most clearly by the elaborate cata logue\nthat the Medinan verse Q 2:177 puts forward of the hallmarks of the muttaqūn; but a link\nbetween guarding oneself against God and charitable giving is already evidenced by the\nearly Meccan verse Q 92:5 (man aʿṭā wa- ttaqā).5\nIn a turn of thought that might at first sight seem paradoxical, t hose who properly guard\nthemselves against God will have “nothing to fear” from God’s future judgement (Q 7:35:\nfa- mani ttaqā wa- aṣlaḥa fa- lā khawfun ʿalayhim wa- lā hum yaḥzanūn, “ those who guard\nthemselves [against God] and act right eously have nothing to be afraid of and w ill not know\ngrief”; Ringgren 1951, 17).6 It is through soteriological anxiety that one may, ultimately,\nbecome one of the saved who, once admitted to paradise, w ill have no more reason to be\nsoteriologically anxious.7 Indeed, it is God, the one against whom one must guard one-\nself during one’s earthly life, whom believers may expect to “guard” or “protect” (waqā)\n2 I assume that dhālika is here used anaphorically, to refer back to the preceding (see under → dhālika).\nThe parenthetical addition is inspired by Paret 2001.\n3 It must be noted that Lamptey herself concedes that taqwā involves “even fear of God” (Lamptey 2014,\n145). I would prefer to say that it primarily consists in such fear. Rendering of taqwā as “God- consciousness”\nwould seem to go back to Asad 1980.\n4 I owe the insight that taqwā crucially involves concrete actions and behaviours to Karen Bauer, who has\nkindly commented on a draft version of this entry and who may develop the point at hand in a forthcoming\npublication.\n5 It is not straightforward to determine whether conjunctions of the form “X and Y” imply that X and Y have\na properly semantic connection (e.g., by virtue of being full or partial synonyms) or whether the link between\nX and Y is a non- semantic (e.g., doctrinal, normative, or empirical) one; see n. 2 in the introduction. Q 92:5 by\nitself thus does not provide clear evidence w hether “guarding oneself” and charitable giving are intertwined\nconceptually or only at the normative level (in the sense that both are required for entry to paradise). For a\nsimilar case, see under → ṣāliḥ.\n6 The phrase lā khawfun ʿalayhim wa- lā hum yaḥzanūn is a frequent verse closer; see, e.g., Q 2:38.62.112\netc., 10:62, 46:13. For a striking Syriac parallel in Ephrem, see Beck 1957a, On Paradise, no. 7:23: lā īt lhon ṣeptā\nd- lā īt lhon ḥashshā // lā īt lhon qenṭā . . . , “They will have no worry, for they will have no grief. // They will\nhave no fear. . . .”\n7 Hence, in so far as lā khawfun ʿalayhim is surely meant to describe the state of the God- fearers in the es-\nchatological future, the verse does not give rise to any logical contradiction, despite its paradoxical appearance\n(pace Ringgren 1951, 17).\nittaqā 721", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

A number\nof passages employing the verbs khashiya or khāfa explic itly contrast fear of God with\nillegitimate fear of humans (Q 2:150, 3:175, 5:3.44, 9:13, 33:37; KK 400). Thus, properly\nfearing (khashiya) God also involves an absence of fear towards anything else (Q 33:39).\nA similar stress on exclusive wariness of God would seem to be conveyed by four verses\nending with a divine commandment to “guard yourselves against me” (Q 2:41, 16:2, 23:52,\n39:16: ±​<wa- iyyāya> fa- ttaqūn).\nOverall, then, ittaqā and taqwā mean to be exclusively wary of the divine judge and\nfearfully to protect oneself against him by means of a range of concrete this- worldly\nactions and behaviours, in the hope of thereby meriting divine protection on the day of\njudgement. As we have seen, ittaqā with a following accusative is often translatable as “to\nprotect or guard o.s. against s.th.,” as in Q 2:24. This would naturally suggest rendering\nintransitive ittaqā as “to protect oneself” (e.g., Jones 2007 on Q 2:2.21; see also CDKA\n294: “to protect o.s., to be wary”) or as “to guard oneself” (thus generally Droge 2013).\nBut rendering the noun taqwā as “guarding oneself” or the like can be awkward, which\nmakes “fear of God” an attractive alternative. Moreover, rendering intransitive ittaqā as\n“to fear God” and taqwā as “fear of God” has the additional advantage of bringing out\nthe concept’s affinity with Biblical notions of fearing God, which are discussed in the\nfollowing section.\nBiblical background. From a genealogical perspective, the Qur’anic use of taqwā may\nbe suggested to be an Arabisation of the Biblical concept of yirʾat YHWH, “fear of the\nLord” (e.g., Isa 11:2–3 or Prov 1:7), corresponding to Greek phobos theou and Syriac deḥlteh\nd- māryā (Alexander 2002, 194; on the fear of God in Biblical and post-B iblical Jewish and\nChristian texts, see, e.g., TDOT 6:290–315; NIDOTTE 2:527–533; TDNT 9:189–219; Lieu\n1995; Becker 2009, 311–317 and 329–330).9 Like Qur’anic taqwā, the Biblical notion of fear-\ning God is not simply “elementary fear” but rather equivalent to “reverence and submissive\nrecognition” (TDNT 9:201; for a similar observation regarding ancient Mesopotamian reli-\ngion, see TDOT 6:299). Thus, and again similar to Qur’anic taqwā, fearing God is not l imited\nto a m ental state but manifests itself in one’s moral and ritual conduct: when the Israelites\nare commanded to “fear the Lord your God,” this is followed by the commandment “to walk\nin all his ways, to love him, to serve the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your\nsoul, // and to keep the commandments of the Lord and his decrees” (Deut 10:12–13; see\nNIDOTTE 2:529–530). A particularly noteworthy comparandum to the pivotal role that the\nQur’an accords to the virtue of taqwā, moreover, is the importance of eschatological fear\n(deḥltā) in Syriac homiletic lit er a ture such as Ephrem and Jacob of Sarug, who articulate\na type of eschatologically minded piety that has a high degree of similarity to the Qur’an\n(Andrae 1926, 127–129; Andrae 1932, 68–71; Sinai 2017a, 233).

It is noteworthy that the term deḥltā here\ncomes to function as a “category of piety,” an approximate equivalent of our modern cate-\ngory of “religion” that is applied not only to Christians but also to Zoroastrianism, termed\n“the fear of the magi” (Becker 2009, 309; see also the striking plural usage deḥlātā, trans-\nlated as “religions,” in Becker 2009, 324). Fear of God also figures in other texts and genres\nof Syriac lit er a ture, such as monastic writings (Becker 2009, 331–332) and the Didascalia\nApostolorum (Zellentin 2016, 283–284).\nIttaqā and taqwā in pre- Qur’anic poetry. It does not appear that the employment of\nArabic ittaqā/taqwā as an approximate Arabic equivalent of the Biblically based notion\nof fearing God is a Qur’anic coinage, since both are already attested in pre- Islamic poetry.\nIzutsu argues that pre- Islamic occurrences of these terms generally have a non- religious\nsense, as in the verse from ʿAntarah cited at the beginning of the entry. But while Izutsu\nmanages to show that ittaqā could carry a non- religious meaning in pre- Qur’anic Arabic,\na sufficient number of poetic occurrences that are not obviously later Islamic fabrications\ndo employ the verb and also the noun with God as its object (Brockelmann 1922, 115; Sinai\n2019b, 48–50). For example, Aws ibn Ḥajar addresses a tribe whom he considers to have\nbreached a covenant, “Are you not fearful of [or on your guard against] God?” (a- lā tat-\ntaqūna llāha), and another poet advises his son, “God (allāh)—f ear him [or ‘guard yourself\nagainst him’] (fa- ttaqihi) and honour vows to him” (Geyer 1892, no. 38:7; Lyall 1918–1924,\nno. 116:3). The use of Arabic ittaqā/taqwā to express the idea of fearing God therefore\npredates the Qur’an, which casts doubt on Izutsu’s assessment that a verse from the dīwān\nof Zuhayr that employs taqwā in a religious sense is exceptional (GMK 235; for the verse,\nsee DSAAP, Zuhayr, no. 17:35). One might also note in this regard that pre-I slamic poetry\ndescribes Christian anchorites and ascetics as “God- fearers” (singular: rāhib, plural: ruh-\nbān), though the word used derives from a dif ere nt consonantal root than w- q- y (DSAAP,\nal- Nābighah, no. 7:26; DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 48:37.66 = EAP 2:69–70 and 2:82–83;\nDSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, nos 52:20, and 65:2).10\nThe continuing importance of eschatological fear in the Medinan surahs. Both\nIzutsu and Ohlander posit that the “intense eschatological coloring” that the concept of\ntaqwā possesses in the early Qur’anic surahs gradually faded away u ntil the term became\nin efect equivalent with a general notion of piety (GMK 239; Ohlander 2005). This is\nquestionable (cf. Lange 2016a, 55–56). It may be granted that later Qur’anic texts, espe-\ncially Medinan surahs, often deploy ittaqā/taqwā without dwelling on the eschatological\nterrors awaiting the sinners. Instead, injunctions to fear God occur in connection with\ngeneral exhortations to serve God or legal prescriptions (e.g., Q 2:21.179.183). Nonethe-\nless, it is doubtful whether the fact that the notion of taqwā is “broadened to include\nlegal, moral, cultic, spiritual and even rather quotidian concerns” (Ohlander 2005, 150)\nmust indicate a lessening of the eschatological anxiety originally bound up with the con-\ncept. Moreover, the fire of hell and the divine judgement do explic itly figure as objects\nof taqwā in some Medinan verses (Q 2:24.48.123.281, 3:131). The fact that ittaqā often\nappears without an object in Medinan passages (e.g., Q 2:21.179.183.187) could well be\nabbreviatory: especially if we assume earlier Qur’anic proclamations to have continued\n10 But see the verse endings of Q 2:40.41 and 16:51.52, indicating that there is some semantic overlap be-\ntween rahiba and ittaqā.\nittaqā 723", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This is clearly the case at Q 41:34,\nwhich talks about turning a former enemy into a waliyy ḥamīm, best translated “a warm\nfriend/ally.” Q 17:33 employs waliyy to mean the next of kin who is entitled to exact blood\nvengeance for somebody who has been unjustly killed. It is almost certainly also in the\nsense of a close relationship between equal parties—i .e., friendship— that Q 8:72 speaks\nof walāyah between the emigrants and those who have aided them (called al- anṣār, “the\nhelpers,” in Q 9:100.117).\nBut in many Qur’anic cases in which A is said to be the waliyy of B, A is “superior to,\ni.e., more power ful than B, so that a translation ‘patron’ may appear to be called for”\n(CDKA 296). Following Ambros, an obvious case in point is statements describing God\nas a waliyy, such as Q 2:257, which contrasts God as the patron of the believers (allāhu\nwaliyyu lladhīna āmanū) with the false gods (→ al-ṭ āghūt) who are the patrons of the re-\npudiators (wa- lladhīna kafarū awliyāʾuhumu l-ṭ āghūtu). Similarly, Q 18:44 pre sents God\nas the only remaining source of walāyah, “patronage.” At Q 19:45, by contrast, Abraham\nexpresses his fear that his father will become a waliyy of the dev il; Ambros is surely right\nthat the correct translation h ere is “client” or “adherent,” which is to say that the relation-\nship is asymmetrical in the opposite sense of Q 2:257: the waliyy is not more but rather\nless power ful than his counterpart. Hence, the question w hether the relationship is sym-\nmetrical or asymmetrical, and if the latter in what way, w ill need to be determined based\non contextual observations.\nMawlā. The usage of mawlā largely corresponds to that of waliyy. Thus, God is called\nthe believers’ mawlā— i.e., “patron”—in Q 2:286, 3:150, and elsewhere. Q 44:41 warns\nof a day “when no mawlā will be of any avail to a mawlā”; the relationship between the\ntwo mawlās in this verse could either be symmetrical (“when no ally will be of any avail to\nanother”) or, perhaps more likely, asymmetrical (“when no patron will be of any avail\nto a client”; thus CDKA 297). Three verses have the plural mawālī. Q 33:4–5 declares\nthat adopted sons are not “yourp real sons” and ought to be called “ after their fathers”;\nif the latter are unknown then they are to count as “your brethren in religion and yourp\nmawālī.” Since reference is to dependants, “clients” is contextually feasible here, though\nan asymmetrical rendering— “friends, associates”— would be more congruent with the\nallusion to brotherhood in religion. More specific are Q 4:33 and 19:5, where the plural\nmawālī seems to refer to relatives that might under certain circumstances be entitled to\ninherit from a deceased person but who are distinct from his children. “Distant kinsfolk”\nor perhaps “relatives who are other wise unspecified” (by virtue of not falling under a\nmore precise label, such as “parent,” “child,” etc.) would seem to be an adequate En glish\nequivalent in these two places. Presumably, it is the aspect of kinship— i.e., of some kind\nof genealogical proximity— rather than that of distance that accounts for the fact that a\nderivative of w-l -y is being used.\nRabbinic parallels for the idea that God is the only true patron. As shown by some\nof the foregoing quotations, the Qur’anic proclamations frequently insist that God is the\nonly true patron of humans and that other patrons will be of no avail, in par tic u lar on the\nday of judgement (e.g., Q 32:4, 34:41, 44:41, 45:10.15).

This motif\nis foreshadowed in Palestinian rabbinic lit er a ture, undoubtedly reflecting the impor tant\nrole that ties of patronage and clientship played in late antique society. For example, the\nJerusalem Talmud reports one Rabbi Yudan to have said that “[a being of] flesh and blood\nhas a patron (paṭron)” who will look after his client if the latter is arrested or brought be-\nfore a court; yet when someone is about to be thrown into a fire, like Shadrach, Meshach,\nand Abednego (cf. Dan 3:13–30), or into a lions’ den, like Daniel (cf. Dan. 6:11–29), the\nonly one capable of extending efective protection is God (y. Bәr. 9:1, 13a = ed. and trans.\nGuggenheimer, 611–614). In other words, when push comes to shove, the only patron\nupon whom one may rely is God, in contrast to all other ostensible sources of security\nand protection. Similarly, Genesis Rabbah cites an interpretation of Gen 17:8 (“And I w ill\ngive to you, and to your ofspring after you, the land . . .”) attributed to the same Rabbi\nJudan, according to which God promised Abraham that if his children w ere to accept God’s\ndivinity, God would be “their God and patron (paṭron); if not, I w ill not be their God and\npatron” (Gen. Rab. 46:9). Slightly earlier in the same chapter, at Gen. Rab. 46:3, Abraham\nworries that people might not continue to flock to him if he undergoes circumcision,\nupon which God reminds him that it is sufficient for Abraham that he, God, is his patron\n(paṭron) and, indeed, that the same applies to the entire world. Several further instances\nin which God is described as a “patron” are found in liturgical poetry in Jewish Palestinian\nAramaic: a poem that dramatises the dispute from Dan 3 between King Nebuchadnezzar,\non the one hand, and Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, on the other, repeats the refrain\nthat “we have a patron” (it lan paṭron/ paṭrin) who does not “slumber or sleep” (Sokolof\nand Yahalom 1999, 120–124 = no. 13:4.12.36.44; see also no. 13:15.20.28.29); another poem,\nlinked to the Ninth of Av and to the destruction of the Jerusalem temple, says that “our\npatron was angry with us” (Sokolof and Yahalom 1999, 160 = no. 22:6); and in yet another\ncomposition the statement “ There is no patron,” uttered by the Biblical figure of Haman,\nfunctions as a general expression of unbelief in God (Sokolof and Yahalom 1999, 206,\nno. 33:22). Clearly, in the Palestinian Jewish tradition references to God as the supreme\n“patron” (cf. Latin patronus and Greek patrōn) of the Israelites and indeed of all h umans\nwere fairly current at one stage (see also Sokolof and Yahalom 1999, 43).\nIt is true that Qur’anic affirmations that God is the only true waliyy or mawlā tend to\nhave an implicitly or explic itly eschatological slant that is not salient in the rabbinic par-\nallels just cited. In both cases, however, there is the idea, first, that humans are faced with\na plethora of potential patrons to whom they might appeal for protection (including both\nfalse deities and more power ful mortals) and, secondly, that it would be a fatal m istake\nto place one’s ultimate trust in anyone but God. Consequently, when the Qur’an frames\nits demand for exclusive human allegiance to God in terms of the social institution of\npatronage, it is quite possibly deploying an established motif of religious discourse in the\nBiblical tradition rather than merely theologising a certain aspect of Arabian tribal society\n(although it is almost certainly doing the latter, too).\nIt may be provisionally suggested that the trope of God as the supreme patron is more\nprominent in the rabbinic tradition than in the Christian one, even though Christian saints\nand holy men were certainly cast as patrons (e.g., Brown 1971).

The Qur’anic pre sen ta tion of the Jews\n(for an overview of which see Rubin 2003a) is complex and terminologically multifaceted.\nAs observed by previous scholars (e.g., BEḲ 15, KU 144 and 153), Meccan surahs contain\nno explicit references e ither to Jews or Christians (→ al- naṣārā) and confine themselves\nto mentioning the “Israelites” (→ banū ˻isrāʾīl) and to alluding to those to whom God\nhas “given the scripture before” (Q 28:52) or the like (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb). In the Medinan\ncorpus, however, Jews and Christians do feature. References to the Jews in par tic u lar\nare often polemical, as illustrated by the contrast between Jewish hostility and Christian\nafability towards the believers in Q 5:82 or the complaint about sundry objectionable\nJewish statements in 4:46. Like the Christians, the Jews are depicted as insisting on their\nexclusive entitlement to salvation and divine guidance (Q 2:111.135; see also 2:94 and 62:6)\nand on being the “sons” or “ children” of God (abnāʾ allāh) and “the ones beloved by him”\n(aḥibbāʾuhu; Q 5:18, on which see under → allāh). At the same time, the Jews are said to\ndismiss the Christians as having no ground to stand on and to be dismissed by them in\ntheir turn (Q 2:113). That the Qur’an deems the Jews to be guilty of unfounded eschatolog-\nical optimism may be inferred from Q 2:80 and 3:24, according to which the Israelites or\n“ those who w ere given a portion of the scripture” say that “the fire [of hell] (al- nār) will\nonly touch us for a number of days.”1 A salient characteristic of the Jews, as presented in\nthe Medinan Qur’an, is their being subject to a complex edifice of dietary prohibitions\n(Q 6:146; see Gräf 1959, 43–44)— prohibitions that are cast as a divine punishment for\nprior misdeeds (Q 4:160–161, 6:146, 16:118; Zellentin 2013, 144–154).2 But despite the\nQur’an’s generally negative portrayal of the Jews, the Medinan verses Q 2:62 and 5:69\npresuppose the existence of Jewish believers “in God and the final day” (man āmana\nbi- llāhi wa- l- yawmi l- ākhiri), while Q 4:162 mentions Jews who are “firmly grounded in\nknowledge” (al-r āsikhūna fī l- ʿilmi minhum) and who believe in the revelations imparted\nto Muhammad.3\nThe Qur’anic terminology for “Jews.” The Qur’an’s nomenclature for Jews includes the\nplural al- yahūd (Q 2:113.120, 5:18.51.64.82, 9:30), whose corresponding singular is yahūdī\n(Q 3:67), and the abbreviated form hūd (Q 2:111.135.140), which only appears u nder very\nspecific grammatical circumstances (namely, as the predicate of kāna, in the indeterminate\naccusative). More frequent than e ither al- yahūd or hūd is the circumlocution alladhīna\nhādū, “t hose who have espoused Judaism” (Q 2:62, 4:46.160, 5:41.44.69, 6:146, 16:118, 22:17,\n62:6). Rather than being a potential reference specifically to converts, alladhīna hādū simply\nexemplifies the Qur’anic proclivity for designating vario us religious communities by means\nof relative clauses containing a plural verb, such as alladhīna āmanū for al- muʾminūn (“the\n1 According to two dicta cited in m. ʿĒd. 2:10, the judgement of the wicked in hell w ill only last twelve months\nor as long as the time between Passover and Pentecost (Mazuz 2014, 70–71).

To all intents and purposes, alladhīna hādū can therefore be\ntreated as equivalent with al- yahūd. The verb hāda is presumably denominative and means\n“to espouse Judaism,” although Q 7:156 employs it together with the preposition ilā, “to,” in\nthe contextual meaning of turning or returning to God. This is likely a play on words, seeing\nthat Q 7:156 reports a first-p erson statement uttered by Israelite contemporaries of Moses\n(CDKA 280–281; see also KK 175–176). Al- yahūd and its circumlocution alladhīna hādū\nlack the historical depth of the term “Israelites” (banū isrāʾīl), in so far as they invariably\ndesignate present- day Jews (KU 91, 153), whereas references to the Israelites can have both\na historical and, less frequently, a cont emporary application (see u nder → isrāʾīl).\nYahūd and its singular yahūdī were established Arabic words prior to the Qur’an. They\noccur in pre- Islamic poetry (Margoliouth 1924, 73; KU 153–154; Lichtenstadter 1940): ʿUr-\nwah ibn al- Ward alludes to “the religion of the Jews,” dīn al- yahūd (Nöldeke 1863, no. 13:1);\nImruʾ al- Qays evokes the stability, apparently proverbial, of a “Jewish building,” bunyān\nal- yahūdī (DSAAP, Imruʾ al- Qays, no. 40:7); and ʿAbīd ibn al- Abraṣ mentions Jewish sail-\nors (Lyall 1913, ʿAbīd, no. 8:6).4 Yhd also appears in Safaitic inscriptions (Al- Jallad 2015a,\n354; Al- Jallad 2021, 40* and 42*–44*). Etymologically, yahūdī is descended from Hebrew\nyәhûdî, perhaps via Aramaic; most likely, it is from yahūdī that yahūd was then second-\narily derived by dropping the nisbah ending (KU 154). Both Hebrew yәhûdî and its Greek\nequivalent ioudaios have an ethnic- geographic significance throughout much of ancient\nlit er a ture, up until at least the second century BCE, and in such cases should be translated\nas “Judaean” rather than as “Jew” or “Jewish” (Cohen 1999, 69–106; Mason 2007). Yet by\nthe time we reach pre- Islamic poetry, yahūd and yahūdī surely mean “Jews” and “Jew” or\n“Jewish.” This is no doubt reflective of non- Jewish, specifically Christian, usage: building\non New Testamental references to hoi ioudaioi, “the Jews,” and similar language (e.g., John\n2:6.13.18.20 or 5:1.10.15.16.18), late antique Christians routinely speak of the “Jews,” often\nin a harshly polemical vein, as illustrated by miscellaneous Christian homilies and writings\ndirected “against the Jews,” e.g., by Jacob of Sarug (Albert 1976; Popa 2019). By contrast, it\nis unlikely that pre- Qur’anic Jews would have called themselves “Jews,” even factoring in\nour far- reaching lack of reliable knowledge about Arabian Judaism (see below). In rabbinic\nlit er a ture, the word yәhudi does not generally function as a self- designation, a role that is\nnormally reserved for the collective “Israel” (e.g., m. Sanh. 10:1). Where Talmudic lit er a-\nture does refer to “the Jews” (yhudaʾe), the statements in question are often attributed or\naddressed to gentiles (see b. Giṭ. 56a; b. Bat. 58a; b. ʿAbod.

The poetic prooftexts cata-\nlogued above are certainly formulated from the perspective of gentile outsiders. There\nare, admittedly, potential flies in the ointment: a tomb inscription in Nabataean Aramaic\nfrom 42–43 CE describes the deceased as yhwdyʾ, although this may mean “the Judaean”\n4 See also Kowalski 1914, no. 7:5.\n730 al- yahūd", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

But it is\noften uncertain w hether the authors of mono the istic Ḥimyarite inscriptions, even when\nexpressing evident sympathy and re spect for Judaism, saw or wished to style themselves\nas fully fledged Jews (what ever that might have meant in fifth- and early sixth- century\nYemen), and this may well apply to the authors of the “Lord of the Jews” inscriptions.5 As\nfor the cemetery inscription Ḥaṣī 1, it was clearly intended to address both Jews and non-\nJews, which would have made it appropriate to have recourse to “the Jews” by way of an\nexternal label. In any case, the Qur’an, by speaking not only of the “Jews” but also of the\n“Israelites” or banū isrāʾīl, utilises the Arabic equivalent of the rabbinic self- designation\n“Israel” as well. It is striking that Ḥimyarite inscriptions display the same terminological\nduality, evoking not only the “Lord of the Jews” (see above), but also the “ people” (s2ʿb)\nof Israel (ys3rʾl; → banū ˻isrāʾīl).\nJews, Israelites, and “scripture- owners.” The overlap between Qur’anic statements\nabout the “Jews,” the “Israelites,” and the “scripture- owners” (→ ˻ahl al- kitāb) makes it\ndifficult to treat the three categories in separation from one another. For instance, all three\ngroups are, unsurprisingly, associated with receipt of the Torah (→ al-t awrāh; e.g.,\nQ 3:93, 5:43–44, and 5:65–66.68); both the Israelites and the Jews are linked with proph-\nets (Q 2:246 and 5:44), whose unjust killing is in turn blamed not only on the Israelites\n(Q 2:61.87.91, 5:70) but also on the scripture- owners (Q 3:112 and 4:155);6 and the accu-\nsation of “turning words from their places” (yuḥarrifūna l- kalima ʿan mawāḍiʿihi), a reso-\nnance of Christian allegations of Jewish misinterpretation of the Old Testament (Reynolds\n2010b, 196–200), is levelled against the Jews in Q 4:46 and 5:41 and against the Israelites\nin 5:13. Such intersections are best accounted for by the standard view that the Qur’anic\nJews are latter- day descendants of the Qur’anic Israelites, while the “scripture- owners”\nencompass both Jews and Christians. It is certainly noticeable that “the Jews” frequently\nfigure together with, or in opposition to, the naṣārā, “Christians” (Q 2:62.111.113.120.135.140,\n3:67, 5:18.51.69.82, 9:30, and 22:17),7 and that the pre sen ta tion of both groups displays a\ntendency towards constructing parallelistic patterns (HCI 201). In Q 9:30 both Jews and\nChristians are indicted for mistaking a h uman being for being “the son of God,” namely,\nJesus in the case of the Christians and Ezra (ʿuzayr) in the case of the Jews.8\n5 A further prob lem in interpreting the divine epithets rb-y hd, rb-h d, or rb-h wd is that, as Robin notes,\nrb = “lord” is not actually Sabaic and may be an Arabic borrowing (Robin 2003, 115, 116–117).\n6 The identity of the collective addressed or referred to in Q 2:61.87.91, 3:112, and 4:155 must be contextually\ninferred. Q 2:61.87.91 come after addresses to the Israelites in vv. 40 and 47 and a renewed reference to them\nin v. 83, while Q 3:112 continues on from the reference to the scripturalists in v. 110. As for Q 4:155, it follows a\nreference to the scripture- owners in v. 153. The accusation of killing the prophets also occurs in Q 3:21.181.183,\nbut there the identity of the addressees is even more elusive, although the allusion to a covenant (ʿ- h- d) imposed\nby God in 3:183 does point to the Israelites (cf. Q 2:40).\n7 Exceptions are Q 4:46, 5:41.44.64, 6:146, 16:118, 62:6. However, Q 5:41.44 are contextually complemented\nby 5:47, commenting on the “ owners of the Gospel,” ahl al- injīl. Q 5:64 opens, “And the Jews say” (wa-q ālati\nl-y ahūd), a phrase whose other occurrences in the Qur’an (Q 2:113, 5:18, 9:30) are accompanied by statements\nascribed to the Christians.\n8 Since Ezra is not described as God’s son in rabbinic sources, there is considerable debate about the under-\nlying logic of this Qur’anic accusation as well as on the question whether ʿuzayr really is the Biblical Ezra.

The Qur’an’s engagement with Judaism,\nwhether under the label of the “Jews” or that of the “Israelites,” raises the issue of the\nhistorical real ity behind the Qur’anic text. According to the Islamic tradition, it was only\nafter the hijrah, in Yathrib/Medina, that the early Islamic community came into close\ncontact with Jewish tribes. This tallies with the observation that explicit mentions of “the\nJews” are limited to Medinan texts and that some Medinan surahs, such as Q 2:40–123 or\n62:5–8, exhibit a much higher degree of polemical interest in the Jews or the Israelites\nthan any part of the Meccan Qur’an. However, Meccan statements affirming that the\nIsraelites, or some among them, do or would acknowledge the truth of the Qur’anic\nrevelations (Q 17:101, 26:197, 46:10) indicate that Jews w ere not absent from the Meccan\nmilieu (Zellentin, forthcoming; see also under → isrāʾīl). In addition, the hypothesis\nthat Jewish interlocutors had a certain presence in the Meccan environment accords well\nwith some facets of the Meccan surahs’ theology that are more easily situated against\na Jewish background than a Christian one. The most impor tant one of these is the po-\nlemical notion of an illicit “association” (verb: → ashraka) of other beings with God, a\nconcept that is ultimately traceable to rabbinic sources. A rabbinic provenance may also\nhold for the Qur’anic tendency, likewise seen already in the Meccan period, to envisage\nthe relationship between God and humans as one of patronage, even if this is for the\ntime being less certain (see under → waliyy).\nIrrespective of w hether one confines a significant Jewish presence to the Qur’an’s Medi-\nnan context or extends it to the Meccan one as well, the scarcity of archaeological remains\nposes a prob lem. It is true that a small number of inscriptions (some of which are in Hebrew\nscript) suggest a Jewish presence in parts of the Ḥijāz, mostly Hegra and Dedan, as early\nas the first century CE. Yet no Jewish or hypothetically Jewish inscriptions have been un-\nearthed in Mecca or Medina or in Khaybar, another impor tant site of Jewish settlement\naccording to the Islamic tradition (Hoyland 2011). This could be seen as grounds to doubt\nthe traditional supposition that the Qur’an’s anti- Jewish polemics are to be historically\nsituated against the backdrop of the Qur’anic community’s escalating conflict with the\nJews of Medina (Reynolds 2010b, 201–202). On the other hand, the lack of overtly Jewish\ninscriptions in Medina or Khaybar is also explicable by positing that the Jews of the Ḥijāz\nwere “a community mostly made up of Arab converts” who w ere “substantially integrated\nwithin Arabian society and barely in touch with non-A rabian Jewish communities, and\npossessing a relatively low level of Jewish education” (Hoyland 2011, 111). The Jews of the\nḤijāz would accordingly have been a community “who knew the principal Biblical tales\nand rabbinic legends and essentials of Jewish ritual (as featured in the Qurʾān) but w ere\nminimally inducted in high Jewish culture and in l imited contact with the wider Jewish\nworld” (Hoyland 2011, 114). By contrast, some scholars have tended, partly on the basis\nof data from post- Qur’anic Islamic sources, to consider the Qur’anic Jews to have been\nfully conversant with the mature rabbinic tradition as documented and codified in the\nMishnah and the two Talmuds (e.g., Mazuz 2014, but see already BEḲ 46–62). Yet it is\nhardly self- evident that late antique Arabian Jews must have been wholly or exclusively\nrabbinic (Hughes 2020).\nThe only solution to the prob lem is to attempt to glimpse some of the beliefs and\npractices of the Jews who were pre sent in the historical context of the Medinan surahs\nby relying primarily on inner- Qur’anic evidence.

Perhaps\nmost obviously, the Qur’an contains many narratives that bear significant affinity with\nmidrashic lore. Select examples, to which many o thers could be added, are the account of\nGod’s dispute with the angels prior to the creation of Adam in Q 2:30–33 (HCI 148–150);\nthe story of Abraham’s destruction of the idols of his father in Q 21:58–67 and 37:88–96\n(WMJA 121–123; BEQ, 135–136; see also Sinai, forthcoming b); the Qur’anic account of Pha-\nraoh’s conversion when faced with his imminent death by drowning in Q 10:90–92 (Sinai\n2019a); and the claim that the Israelites were cowed into accepting God’s covenant (mīthāq;\nsee under → wāthaqa) because God threateningly raised Mount Sinai above their heads\n(Q 2:63.93, 4:154, 7:171; see WMJA 161; BEQ 303–304; Obermann 1941, 34–37; Hartwig\n2008; Graves 2015). Q 10:90–92, among other passages, shows that such midrashically\ntinged material is not limited to Medinan surahs,10 which confirms that some familiarity\nwith midrashic traditions must be posited already for the Meccan period.\nBeyond such narrative parallels, the Medinan Qur’an is distinguished by an additional\ndegree of acquaintance with specific aspects of rabbinic language and ritual practice. This\nacquaintance is best explained by positing that the Ḥijāzī Jews with whom the Qur’anic\ncommunity interacted (HCI 196–197) did indeed have a basic degree of familiarity with\nrabbinic traditions. Medinan reflections of rabbinic language include the following cases:\n- Q 5:32 has been identified as paraphrasing a passage from the Mishnah (m. Sanh. 4:5;\nsee WMJA 102–103; BEQ 459; Pregill 2021).\n- The Medinan affirmation that some p eople have “no share in the hereafter” (lā khalāqa\nlahum fī l-ā khirah; Q 2:102.200 and 3:77) echoes a frequent rabbinic turn of phrase\n(→ khalāq).\n- The Qur’an calls the leaders of the Jews rabbāniyyūn and aḥbār (Q 3:79, 5:44.63,\n9:31.34), expressions that are unmistakably derived from rabbinic titles for religious\nscholars (WMJA 48–49, 51–52; BEḲ 51; KU 63–64; JPND 197–198 and 200–201; FVQ\n49–50 and 137–138; Newby 1988, 57–58; Zellentin 2016, 267–271): the former from\nthe reverential address “our teacher” (rabban; DTTM 1444), the latter from the title\n“fellow, colleague” (ḥabēr; DTTM 421–422).11\n- Other items in the lexicon of the Medinan Qur’an that have clear rabbinic antecedents\nand are most likely drawn from the language of the Medinan Jews comprise → ummī,\n“scriptureless”; minhāj, “custom” (Q 5:48), stemming from Hebrew minhag or Aramaic\nminhaga (BEḲ 89; JPND 225; FVQ 273; see also under → aslama); kaffārah, “expiation,”\n9 Hirschfeld had far less reason than con temporary historians to be suspicious of the reliability of extra-\nQur’anic traditions, and he proceeds accordingly.\n10 But note that the version of God’s raising of Mount Sinai in Q 7:171 may form part of the surah’s Medinan\nstratum, seeing that its parallels Q 2:63.93 and 4:154 are all Medinan. See also Hartwig 2008, 192–193.\n11 Unlike Geiger and Horovitz, Newby interprets rabbāniyyūn to mean “rabbinites,” “a term of self- description\nby the Geonim and the usual Karaite word used to refer to the majority group of Jews, the followers of rabbinic\nprecepts” (Newby 1988, 57). This is however difficult to square with Q 5:44.63, where the rabbāniyyūn must be\nJewish leaders rather than an entire strand of Judaism. Jefery, meanwhile, argues that the immediate origin of\nrabbāniyyūn is Syriac rather than rabbinic.\nal- yahūd 733", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}

This\nwould be in line with Hoyland’s conjecture of an advanced stage of cultural integration.12\nApart from Qur’anic vestiges of rabbinic language, t here are also some aspects of Me-\ndinan law that are closely related to rabbinic ritual practice:\n- The criterion for determining the time of daybreak on fast- days that is advanced\nin Q 2:187— namely, the ability to distinguish visually between black and white—\nresembles advice given in the Mishnah (m. Bәr. 1:2; WMJA 87; BEḲ 77; BEQ 459).\n- The licence to perform one’s ablutions before prayer with soil, should w ater be un-\navailable (Q 5:6; see also u nder → ṭahara), matches a practice recommended in the\nBabylonian Talmud, at b. Bәr. 15a (GQ 1:199; see also WMJA 86).\n- The dispensation to shorten prayers while travelling if there is reason to fear an attack\nby unbelievers (Q 4:101) corresponds to the Mishnaic permission that someone who\n“travels in a place of danger” may recite a shortened prayer (m. Bәr. 4:4; see also\nb. Bәr. 29b; WMJA 85–86; Rivlin 1934, 110–111).\nSuch similarities are best accounted for by supposing that in the historical milieu addressed\nby the Medinan surahs t here was an observance of certain basic elem ents of rabbinic law.\nThe most likely carriers of such practices are the Medinan Jews, given that the parallels\njust listed are confined to the Medinan Qur’an.\nThree additional observations round out the profile of the Ḥijāzī Jews that may be\ninferred from the Qur’an. First, at least one Medinan passages directed against the Jews\nwould seem to be predicated on a cross- lingual pun that requires at least some knowledge\nof Hebrew among cont emporary Jews: the utterance samiʿnā wa-ʿ aṣaynā (“We hear and\ndisobey”), ascribed to the Israelites or Jews in Q 2:93 and 4:46, is phonetically close to,\nand likely a polemical inversion of, the Israelites’ statement wә-š āmaʿnû wә- ʿāśînû (“We\nwill hear and do [it]”) in Deut 5:27, expressing their willingness to carry out God’s com-\nmandments (→ samiʿa). Secondly, a recent study has made a compelling case that Q 5:64’s\nallegation that the Jews say, “God’s hand is fettered (maghlūlah),” reflects a liturgical poem,\nor piyyuṭ, on the Roman destruction of the Second Temple by the Palestinian poet Elʿa-\nzar berabbi Qallir (or Qillir), apparently active in the first half of the seventh c entury CE\n(Lowin 2019; on the poet, see Münz- Manor 2019). Thirdly, the similitude (mathal) that\ncompares “ those who have been made to carry the tawrāh and then failed to carry it” to\n“a donkey carry ing tomes” in Q 62:5 may draw on an image already found in rabbinic lit-\ner a ture (see under → tawrāh).\n12 On the other hand, two reports transmitted by al- Wāqidī about Muhammad’s Medinan de cade depict\nthe Jews of Khaybar and of Medina as speaking a non- Arabic language called al- yahūdiyyah, which one might\nunderstand to mean a dialect of Aramaic (Gil 1984, 205–206, citing Jones 1966, 1:392; see also Jones 1966, 2:461),\nthough others have considered this to refer to a dialect of Arabic (see the overview in Robin 2015b, 73–74).

Nonethe-\nless, the Qur’anic data does not permit the more confident conclusion that “the Medinan\nJews w ere Talmudic- Rabbinic Jews in almost e very re spect” (Mazuz 2014, 99). It certainly\ngives pause that the Medinan surahs reflect some awareness of Biblical lit er a ture, in so\nfar as they reference the Torah (→ al-t awrāh), the Gospel (→ al-i njīl), and what seems\nto be the book of Psalms (see under → zabūr), yet name neither the Mishnah nor the\nTalmud.13 Moreover, it is impossible to rule out that some of the beliefs and practices of\nthe Medinan Jews might have diverged from the rabbinic tradition as it pre sents itself to\nus in the Mishnah and the two Talmuds. For example, in Q 4:153 the “scripture- owners”\nare said to challenge the Qur’anic Messenger to “bring down upon them a scripture from\nheaven” (see also u nder → nazzala).14 It would not be far-f etched to infer from this verse\nthat some of the Medinan scripturalists w ere acquainted with traditions about the celestial\nascension of certain exceptional humans that are found, for example, in the hēkalot lit er-\na ture.15 Furthermore, the exceptional presence of a close parallel to a par tic u lar Mishnaic\nstatement in Q 5:32 clearly does not, without further argument, warrant the assumption\nthat the Medinan Jews had the detailed command of the entire Mishnah, let alone of\nTalmudic lit er a ture, that one would expect, say, of scholars active at the same time in the\nJewish academies of Mesopotamia.16\nyawm:\nal- ~ al- ākhir | the final day\n~ al- dīn | judgement day\n~ al- qiyāmah | the day of resurrection\n~aʾidhin | on that day\n→ ākhir, → dīn1, → qiyāmah\n13 As discussed elsewhere, it is pos si ble that the plural → mathānī found in the Meccan verses Q 15:87 and\n39:23 has its ultimate etymological origin in Hebrew mishnah or the latter’s Aramaic equivalent matnita (WMJA\n57–58; NB 26; FVQ 257–258). In its Qur’anic usage, the word certainly does not refer to the Mishnah; but the\npresence of the term in the Qur’anic text could be adduced as circumstantial evidence that Arabophone Jews in\nthe Qur’anic milieu used a hy po thet i cal singular mathnāh to render Hebrew mishnah.\n14 A variant of the same request, this time explic itly mentioning the concept of ascension (tarqā, ruqiyy),\noccurs in Q 17:93, although the opponents there are not identified as scripturalists and may be conjectured to\nbe the Messenger’s pagan opponents.

Line-\nopening expressions that are commonly used with the definite article (e.g., “the hereafter”)\nare followed by “the” in brackets. For more detailed grammatical information regarding\nthe Arabic expressions, see the main dictionary. As explained in the section “How to Use\nThis Book,” for some impor tant Qur’anic terms I include common translations that I do\nnot endorse, such as “unlettered” and “illiterate” for ummī (which in my view is more\nadequately translated as “scriptureless”) or “upright” and “of pure mono the istic faith” for\nḥanīf.

To illustrate this policy, the index\ndoes not list the many Qur’anic occurrences of the verb → jāhada (“to contend”) that\nfigure in the respective entry; but the index does include Q 9:29, which is treated in some\ndetail in the final section of the article on → jāhada. The upshot is that readers interested\nin a specific Qur’anic verse that employs terminology analysed in this dictionary—s uch as\nQ 2:96, which mentions “the associators” (alladhīna ashrakū)— cannot rely on the pre sent\nindex to supply an exhaustive list of where the verse in question figures throughout the\nbook. In such cases, readers will therefore need to go directly to the entry on → ashraka,\n“to associate,” in the main dictionary (potentially via the previous two indices).\n1 169–170, 177 (n. 17), 344 (n. 27), 482 2:36 2 9, 453\n1:1 (and the basmalah generally) 130–134, 2:38 7 02, 721 (n. 6)\n345–347 2:40–123 732\n1:3 3 43, 533–534 2:40 4 8, 677, 680, 710, 723 (n. 10)\n1:4 6 44 2:41 468, 676 (n. 30), 722, 723 (n. 10)\n1:6 4 73 2:42 1 12\n1:7 5 33–535 2:44 89\n2:47 4 8, 677, 679–680\n2 351, 525 2:48 6 83, 723\n2:1 5 3–59 2:51 5 03\n2:2 3 19–322 2:53 5 46–552\n2:3 5 41 2:54 2 72, 503–504\n2:6 6 06 (n. 3) 2:57 5 04, 538\n2:8–16 621 2:61 5 1, 535, 652 (n. 1), 654–655, 731 (incl. n. 6)\n2:8–9 102–103 2:62 5 2, 102–103, 113, 240 (n. 7), 340–341, 404–405,\n2:8 694 463–464, 527, 610, 673, 693, 721 (n. 6), 729\n2:10 7 06 2:63 7 11–712, 733\n2:14 4 52 2:67–73 127, 302\n2:15 7 06 2:70 1 55 (n. 14), 193 (n. 12)\n2:20 5 64 2:72 1 12, 682\n2:21 6 14–615 2:74 5 76–577, 582\n2:23 4 21 2:78 9 4–99\n2:24 7 19–723 2:79 1 12, 603\n2:25 1 93–194, 492, 495–499 2:80 2 57, 729\n2:26 6 19 2:81 6 03–604\n2:27 5 55, 710 2:83–84 711–712\n2:29 5 64–565 2:85 5 09, 711\n2:30–33 554, 733 2:87 5 1, 358, 540, 565–566, 655–656, 686, 731\n2:30 2 58–269, 555–557, 566–567, 634–635 (incl. n. 6)\n2:33 5 42 2:88 5 39–540, 582\n2:34 2 66 (n. 20), 384, 453–457, 607 2:89 4 68\n2:35 5 03 2:90 5 35\n791", "meta": {"extraction": "pdf_text"}}
