The context of 11:5 refers to those who\nْ ْ ْ ْ\nshun divine guidance: they try to hide from God (َ ُ هنم َاو ُ فخت َ س َ ي ل). And the last part of the\nverse says that God is fully aware of the secrets in men’s hearts (َر و ْ د ُ صُ لاَت اذَ ب ٌَيم ْ ل ع َ َ ُ هََن إ ). In\nthis cluster of ideas – “hiding,” “secrets,” and “the heart as the repository of secrets” – the\nْ ْ\nuse of the word ردص in 11:5 would seem to be apposite. In 22:9, on the other hand, فطع\nَ\nْ ٌ ْ ْ ْ\nand َلَ ض َ َأ both partake of the meaning of “crookedness” (فطع , “side” [َفطع َق ير َ طلاَفِ ,\n“There is a twist/curve in the road”; َلَ ض َ َأ, “to cause to deviate/swerve”). Also, the context\nof 22:9 refers to a person who not only rejects guidance himself, but, taking a step\nْ ْ\nfurther, tries to lead other people astray as well (َ لَ يب س\nَ\nَنع\nَ\nَلَ ض\nُ\nي ل).\nThere may be another difference between the two expressions: 11:5 seems to suggest\nthat one “turns away” in indifference, 22:5, that one does so in pride – though\nindifference and pride are not, and to the Qur’an they are definitely not, mutually\nexclusive.\nَ َل ً ب َإ ََىى ع\nَ\nر\nَ\nَن ْ َأَاعً ي ْ ب ر\nَ\nَن\nَ\nَأَت\nُ\nئ ْ ب\nُ\nن\nْ ْ ْ\nَ يد يج لاَ َ ن اثََ ُ ها َ نخ َ َل َ َ إ َيد يُ ُ\nI am told that Rabi’, now that he grazes camels [= has become wealthy], sends me the gift\nof foul language, being stuck up\nْ\nُ َهف َ طع َز َ ه َ , “to make somebody happy”\nَىى شغ ْ تس ْ ا (َيَشَغ) as a verb with an object To wrap one’s clothes about oneself/fold one’s garments around oneself [in order to\nَ\nleave] [ = to show indifference]\nْ\nْ\nَهبايث ََىى شغتسا\nُ َ َ The image is that of a person who is presented with a message but who, instead of\nlistening to it, wraps his garments around himself and takes off, thus showing indifference\n11 5 240 to what is being said.

Also, the context\nof 22:9 refers to a person who not only rejects guidance himself, but, taking a step\nْ ْ\nfurther, tries to lead other people astray as well (َ لَ يب س\nَ\nَنع\nَ\nَلَ ض\nُ\nي ل).\nThere may be another difference between the two expressions: 11:5 seems to suggest\nthat one “turns away” in indifference, 22:5, that one does so in pride – though\nindifference and pride are not, and to the Qur’an they are definitely not, mutually\nexclusive.\nَ َل ً ب َإ ََىى ع\nَ\nر\nَ\nَن ْ َأَاعً ي ْ ب ر\nَ\nَن\nَ\nَأَت\nُ\nئ ْ ب\nُ\nن\nْ ْ ْ\nَ يد يج لاَ َ ن اثََ ُ ها َ نخ َ َل َ َ إ َيد يُ ُ\nI am told that Rabi’, now that he grazes camels [= has become wealthy], sends me the gift\nof foul language, being stuck up\nْ\nُ َهف َ طع َز َ ه َ , “to make somebody happy”\nَ َمدَ ق َ َ)مَدَق ) as a verb with an object T o perform an act/a deed\n22 10 268 ُ\nَهَم\nَ\nد\nَ\nق\nَ\nَب َ َلق َ ن ْ ا (َبَلَق) as a verb with a preposition (َلى ع َ ) To do an about-face\n22 11 286\nْ ْ\nَ َه ه جو\nَ\nََلى ع\nَ\nَب\nَ َ\nلق\nَ\nنا\nPage 229 of 404"

For while the ينمضت َ of َ َ ءز َ تْ َ سا or َلَ ج َ عت َ سا might be justified in a verse like 70:1,\nit might be questionable with regard to 25:59, and that for two reasons. First, the\nconstruction َه ب َل َ أس occurs frequently in Classical Arabic, and sometimes in situations\nْ ْ ْ\nwhere the ينمضت َ of َ َ ءز َ تْ َ سا would not serve as an adequate explanation (see poetical\nْ ْ ْ\nverses cited below). Second the \"inappropriateness\" of the ينمضت َ of َ َ ءز َ تْ َ سا in 25:95 does\nْ\nnot prelude the possibility of some other-\"appropriate\"- ينمضت َ. Take, for example, the\nfollowing verse by Janūb, in which she relates how she learnt to her horror that the men\nof whom she had inquired about her brother turned out to be his killers:\nْ ْ ْ\nوبَ\nَ\nحص\nَ\nَخيأَر مع\nَ\nب َت\nُ\nلَأس\nَ\nPage 249 of 404"

This ينمضت َ would also explain very effectively a verse like Sakhr al-Ghayy's, in\nwhich َه ب َل َ َأس َ is used along with َل َ َأس َ ُ َهنع َ , each phrase helping to fix and clarify the meaning\nْ\nof the other; or a verse like Awf ibn al-Ahwas's in which the negative construction, َمَلَو\nابِ َلأسَا, implies utter lack of concern or interest; or a verse like\nْ ْ ْ ْ ْ\nAlqamah's. Islāhi's suggestion of the ينمضت َ of َلَ ج َ عت َ سا ( as against َ َ ءز َ تْ َ سا ) in 25:59 is more\nْ ْ ْ ْ\nto the point, though we should note, first, that by Islāhi, َلَ ج\nَ\nعت\nَ\nسا seems to mean لاجعت سا\nْ ْ ْ ْ ْ\nmarked by ازتْ سا , which makes the two ينمضت َ-words interchangeable, leaving َلَ ج\nَ\nعت\nَ\nسا\nْ ْ ْ\nopen to the same objection as is َ َ ءز َ تْ َ سا ; and, second, that ىنت َ عا would seem to cover a\nْ\ngreater variety of situations than either of the two ينمضت َ-words suggested by Islāhi, and,\nin 25:59 at any rate, would seem to be more suitable. It is, however, possible to combine\nthe interpretation suggested here with Islāhi's - without of course, taking over his\nargument for it. This can be done by positing that another prepositional phrase, َه ب , is\nً ْ\nunderstood after يْبخ َ , the complete construction thus being, َه ب َايْبخ َ َه ب َلأس َ َ ف, in which the\nfirst َه ب would go with َل َ َأس َ and the second with يْبخ َ .\nPage 250 of 404"

Second, i implies that the listener\neither lacks all knowledge about the thing in question or is unaware of its true\nsignificance, whereas ii implies that the listener may have formed some idea of what is\nbeing talked about, but could be grossly mistaken in his estimation.

Second, i implies that the listener\neither lacks all knowledge about the thing in question or is unaware of its true\nsignificance, whereas ii implies that the listener may have formed some idea of what is\nbeing talked about, but could be grossly mistaken in his estimation. Third, i takes the form\nْ\n69 3 121 of an explication, but ii is in the form of a comment: َكَ ار َ دَأَام َ is, in all the verses it occurs\nin, regularly followed by a َو َ ه ُ َام َ construction, which paves the way for an explication of\nthe subject under discussion, thus suggesting that the gap in the listener's knowledge\nneeds to be filled; َك َ ي ْ ر د ْ ي َ َام َ , on the other hand, is in all cases followed by a اذَ كَ َ ُ للَّ ى اَلَ ع ََل\nconstruction, implying that it is not necessary to fill the gap in the listener's knowledge,\nthough he should be warned of the error in the view he has formed of something. This\nanalysis is based on a study of the Quranic examples. It seems that the last of the three\nconditions is not crucial as far as Arabic usage in general is concerned.\nPage 373 of 404"

But the word is\nْ\ninterpreted to mean, “greedy”, arguing that the preposition لع َ suggests the ينم ضت َ of\nصر ح\nَ\n. For the verse, he says, is drawing a distinction between the psychology of a prophet\nand that of a soothsayer: unlike the latter, who hungers for the suggestions – false as they\nare – of the Jinn and may accordingly be said to have initiated the process of his\n“revelation”, the Prophet simply presents before people what he is given and does not go\nabout hunting for revelation.\nْ\nIt is possible to build on the previous view. The ينم ضت َ of صر ح َ suggested by ( لع َ ) gives to\nْ\nthe phrase ( َه يَلع َ َين نض َ ) two interrelated meanings: (1) Muhammad is not “greedy” ( صر ح َ\nْ\n) – for, unlike the soothsayers, he is not eager to acquire news of بيغ َ , wishing to impress\nhis followers, but is content to receive the revelation that comes to him from God. (2) But\nhe is not “stingy” ( ين نض َ ) either – for, once he receives a revelation, he does not withhold\nit from people, but presents it before them in its complete form (Compare with the use of\nحيح ش َ in 33:19)\nAnd he is not too keen/eager to learn about the unknown\nَب َ ه َ َذ (َبَهَذ) as a verb\nَب َ ه َ َذ here has the sense of “to take a course of action.” The verse thus means: How\nْ\nْ\n81 26 130 strange is your conduct?

Third, i takes the form\nْ\n104 5 121 of an explication, but ii is in the form of a comment: َكَ ار َ دَأَام َ is, in all the verses it occurs\nin, regularly followed by a َو َ ه ُ َام َ construction, which paves the way for an explication of\nthe subject under discussion, thus suggesting that the gap in the listener's knowledge\nneeds to be filled; َك َ ي ْ ر د ْ ي َ َام َ , on the other hand, is in all cases followed by a اذَ كَ َ ُ للَّ ى اَلَ ع ََل\nconstruction, implying that it is not necessary to fill the gap in the listener's knowledge,\nthough he should be warned of the error in the view he has formed of something. This\nanalysis is based on a study of the Quranic examples. It seems that the last of the three\nconditions is not crucial as far as Arabic usage in general is concerned.\n105 2 213 َلَ َل ض َ ( لَلَض ) as a verb with an object To thwart somebody’s stratagem\nPage 402 of 404"
